It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

            "Okay, so the question is, can penguins fly? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by thinking about what I know about penguins. I remember that penguins are birds, right? So, birds can fly, or at least some of them can. But wait, not all birds can fly. For example, ostriches and emus can't fly, but they have wings. So, maybe penguins can fly too, but I'm not sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should consider the physical characteristics of penguins. They live in the cold, mostly in Antarctica. Their bodies are adapted for swimming, with their wings being flat and webbed. Oh, wait, penguins don't fly in the traditional sense like birds do. They don't have feathers on their wings like other birds. Instead, their wings are more like flippers. So, if their wings are flippers, maybe they don't use them to fly. That makes me think penguins can't fly.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I should check if there's any other way penguins might be able to fly. Do they migrate? No, penguins don't migrate; they stay in the same area. So, they don't fly to different places. Also, I've never seen a penguin in the air. They're always swimming or walking on the ground. Maybe they can't fly because their bodies aren't built for it. Their bones might be too heavy, or their muscles aren't strong enough for flight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another angle is to think about how other birds fly. They use their feathers to create lift and move their wings. Penguins have羽毛 (feathers), but those are used for insulation and swimming. Their wings are too big and not shaped for flight. So, without the proper wing structure and feathers, penguins can't generate the lift needed to fly.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also consider if any penguins can fly. Maybe some species can? I know there are different types of penguins, like the little blue penguin and the emperor penguin. If any of them can fly, that would change my answer. But from what I remember, none of them can fly. They're all excellent swimmers but not flyers.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, putting it all together, penguins have wings that are adapted for swimming, not flying. They don't have the necessary wing structure or feathers for flight. Therefore, I think the answer is no, penguins cannot fly.\n",

            "Let me see if that makes sense. It addresses the question, clarifies my nature as an AI, and offers assistance. That seems appropriate. I should also make sure there's no typo or grammatical error in my response. It needs to sound natural and professional.\n",
