Q: Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag.  If Archie buys 1 bag while they're $3.00 off a bag, how much will each stick of jerky cost in cents?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Archie buying beef jerky. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the jerky comes in bags with 30 sticks each and costs $18.00 per bag. But then it mentions that they're $3.00 off a bag. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. If the bag is $18.00 and they're $3.00 off, does that mean the price is reduced by $3.00? So, the new price per bag would be $18.00 minus $3.00? Let me check that.

So, $18.00 minus $3.00 is $15.00. That seems right. So, instead of each bag costing $18.00, it's now $15.00. Okay, so the price per bag is now $15.00. 

Now, Archie buys 1 bag. So, he's paying $15.00 for a bag that has 30 sticks. The question is asking how much each stick of jerky will cost in cents. So, I need to find the cost per stick in cents.

Let me break this down. First, the total cost is $15.00 for 30 sticks. So, to find the cost per stick, I should divide the total cost by the number of sticks. 

So, $15.00 divided by 30 sticks. Let me do that division. 

First, I can write $15.00 as 1500 cents because the question asks for the answer in cents. So, 1500 cents divided by 30 sticks. 

Let me compute that. 1500 divided by 30. Hmm, 30 goes into 150 five times because 30 times 5 is 150. So, 1500 divided by 30 is 50. So, 1500 cents divided by 30 sticks is 50 cents per stick.

Wait, let me double-check that. 30 sticks at 50 cents each would be 30 times 50, which is 1500 cents, which is $15.00. That matches the total cost. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. The original price was $18.00 per bag, and they're $3.00 off. So, $18.00 minus $3.00 is indeed $15.00 per bag. So, that part is correct.

Then, 30 sticks for $15.00. So, 15 divided by 30 is 0.5 dollars per stick. 0.5 dollars is 50 cents. So, that's consistent.

Wait, another way to think about it is, if 30 sticks cost $15, then each stick is 15 divided by 30, which is 0.5 dollars. So, 0.5 dollars is 50 cents. So, yeah, that's the same answer.

So, I think that's correct. So, each stick is 50 cents.

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If 30 sticks cost $15, then 1 stick costs $15 / 30. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 30 is 0.5. So, 0.5 dollars is 50 cents. So, that's the same result.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of unit price, it's $15.00 divided by 30 sticks. So, 15.00 divided by 3.0. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 0 divided by 0 is 0, so 5.00 per stick, which is 500 cents. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 15 divided by 3 is 5, but 15.00 divided by 3.00 is 5.00 divided by 3.00, which is 5.00 / 3.00. Let me compute that.

So, 5.00 divided by 3.00. Let me write that as 500 divided by 300. 500 divided by 300 is 1.6666... So, 1.6666 dollars per stick,
