Q: Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total length of the flower bed in inches to calculate how many plants are needed.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the total length in inches is 111 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot, which equals 1332 inches.

Next, I'll account for the space already occupied by the 17 plants. Each plant takes up 12 inches, so 17 plants take up 17 multiplied by 12 inches, which is 204 inches.

Subtracting the space taken by the existing plants from the total length gives the remaining space needed: 1332 inches minus 204 inches equals 1108 inches.

Now, I'll calculate how many additional plants are needed by dividing the remaining space by the space required between each plant. Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space, which is 18 inches. Dividing 1118 inches by 18 inches per plant gives approximately 62.11 plants. Since you can't have a fraction of of a plant, Pat will need 63 additional plants.

Finally, I'll determine the total number of plants needed by adding the existing 17 plants to the 63 additional plants, resulting in 80 plants in total.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be 80 plants multiplied by $6 per plant, which equals $480.

**Solution:**

1. **Convert the flower bed length to inches:**
   
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the space taken by the existing 17 plants:**
   
   \[
   17 \text{ plants} \times 12 \text{ inches/plant} = 204 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining space needed:**
   
   \[
   1332 \text{ inches} - 204 \text{ inches} = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   
   \[
   \frac{128 \text{ inches}}{18 \text{ inches/plant}} \approx 7.11 \text{ plants}
   \]
   
   Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, Pat needs 8 additional plants.

5. **Total number of plants needed:**
   
   \[
   17 \text{ existing plants} + 8 \text{ additional plants} = 25 \text{ plants}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   \[
   25 \text{ plants} \times \$6/\text{plant} = \$150
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
