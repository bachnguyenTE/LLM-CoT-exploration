Q: John packs M&M in small bags to eat.  He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each.  If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John packing M&M into small bags. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Hmm, wait, 10 ounces? That seems a bit light for a large bag. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 10 ounces? Or maybe it's 10 pounds? Hmm, but the next part says an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M. So, maybe the weight is correct. Let me go with 10 ounces for now.

So, he buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, total weight of all the M&M is 3 times 10 ounces. That would be 30 ounces. Wait, 3 times 10 ounces is 30 ounces? Wait, 3 times 10 is 30? No, 3 times 10 is 30? Wait, no, 3 times 10 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 33? Wait, no, 10 is 10, so 10 times 3 is 30. Yeah, that's right. So, 30 ounces total.

Wait, but 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so 3 times 10 is 30? Wait, 10 ounces each, so 3 times 10 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, no, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, 10 is 10, so 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, no, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, no, 10 times 3 is 30. Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Wait, no, 10 times 3 is 30. Wait, 10 times 3 is 30. So, 3 times 10 is 30. So, 30 ounces total.

Wait, but 3 times 10 is 30? Wait, 3 times 10 is 30. So, 30 ounces total. So, that's the total weight of all the M&M.

Then, the problem says, "If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?"

Wait, so each ounce has 30 M&M, and he wants to make small bags with 10 M&M each. So, first, I need to find out how many M&M are in the total weight, then figure out how many small bags he can make with 10 each.

So, first, total weight is 30 ounces. Each ounce has 30 M&M. So, total number of M&M is 30 ounces times 30 M&M per ounce. Let me calculate that.

30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.

So, he has 900 M&M in total.

Now, he wants to make small bags with 10 M&M each. So, how many small bags can he make? That would be total number of M&M divided by number per small bag.

So, 900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags.

Wait, so he can make 90 small bags? Hmm, that seems a lot, but let me check.

Wait, 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so 30 ounces total. Each ounce has 30 M&M, so 30 * 30 is 900 M&M. Then, each small bag is 10 M&M, so 900 /10 is 90. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but 90 small bags? That's 90 bags, each with 10 M&M. So, 90 *10 is 900 M&M, which matches the total. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but 90 small bags seems like a lot. Is that right? Let me think.

Wait, 3 large bags, each 10 ounces, so 30 ounces. Each ounce has 30 M&M, so 30 *30 is 900 M
