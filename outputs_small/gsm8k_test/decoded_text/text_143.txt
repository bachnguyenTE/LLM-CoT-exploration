Okay, so I have this problem here where John buys different items, and I need to figure out how much everything cost, including tax. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There's a 10% tax on all nonfood items. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out which items are food and which are not. From the names, milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Wait, roach traps are a bit odd, but I guess they're considered food items. So, milk, eggs, light bulbs, and cups are probably food items, and roach traps are nonfood? Or maybe all except roach traps are food? Let me check the problem again.

It says, "If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items." So, nonfood items are the ones without food names. So, milk, eggs, light bulbs, cups are food, and roach traps are nonfood. So, the tax is only on the nonfood items, which is just the roach traps.

So, first, I need to calculate the total cost of all items before tax. Then, calculate the tax on the nonfood items, add that to the total, and that should be the final amount.

Let me write down the costs:

Milk: $2

Eggs: $3

Light bulbs: $3

Cups: $3

Rochest traps: $4

So, total cost before tax is 2 + 3 + 3 +3 +4.

Let me add these up step by step.

2 + 3 is 5.

5 + 3 is 8.

8 + 3 is 11.

11 + 4 is 15.

So, total before tax is $15.

Now, tax is 10% on nonfood items. Which is only the roach traps, which are $4.

So, tax on roach traps is 10% of 4.

10% of 4 is 0.4.

So, tax is $0.40.

Therefore, total cost is 15 + 0.40 = 15.40.

So, $15.40 total.

Wait, let me double-check.

Total cost before tax: 2 + 3 +3 +3 +4.

2 +3 is 5, 5 +3 is 8, 8 +3 is 11, 11 +4 is 15. That's correct.

Tax on nonfood items: only roach traps, which are $4. 10% of 4 is 0.40. So, total is 15 + 0.40 = 15.40.

So, $15.40 is the total cost.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the tax applied to all nonfood items, or just the nonfood items? The problem says, "If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items." So, yes, only the nonfood items are subject to tax. So, only the roach traps are taxed, which is $4, so 10% of that is $0.40. So, total is $15.40.

Alternatively, if the tax was applied to all items, including food, then the tax would be 10% of 15, which is 1.50, so total would be 16.50. But the problem says only nonfood items are taxed, so it's $15.40.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says, "If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items." So, only nonfood items are taxed. So, only the roach traps are taxed, which is $4. So, 10% of 4 is 0.40, so total is 15 + 0.40 = 15.40.

So, the answer is $15.40.

But let me think again, is there a chance that the tax is applied to all items, but the problem says "on all nonfood items"? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items." So, it's 10% tax on nonfood items, so only the nonfood items are taxed. So, only the roach traps are taxed.

So, the total is 15 + 0.40 = 15.40.

So, $15.40 is the total cost.
