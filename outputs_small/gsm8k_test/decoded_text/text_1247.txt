Q: Brendan has a bag of marbles with 10 inside. He tripped over a pebble while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 3. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. One of them he picked up wasn't a marble, but actually a bead so he got rid of it. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Brendan starts with 10 marbles.

He drops half of them while carrying, which is 5 marbles.

He finds 3 marbles during his search.

He discards 1 bead instead of a marble.

So, the total number of marbles Brendan ends up with is 10 - 5 + 3 - 1 = 7 marbles.
</think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many marbles Brendan ends up with.

1. **Initial Number of Marbles:**
   Brendan starts with **10 marbles**.

2. **Dropping Half the Marbles:**
   Brendan drops half of the marbles while carrying them. 
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles dropped} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]
   So, after dropping, he has:
   \[
   10 - 5 = 5 \text{ marbles left}
   \]

3. **Finding 3 Marbles:**
   Brendan searches for the dropped marbles and finds **3 marbles**.
   \[
   \text{Marbles found} = 3
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining marbles:
   \[
   5 + 3 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Discarding a Bead:**
   Brendan discards **1 bead** instead of a marble. Since a bead is not a marble, this action doesn't affect the count of marbles.
   \[
   \text{Marbles discarded} = 1
   \]
   However, since he discarded a bead, the number of marbles remains unchanged.

5. **Final Count of Marbles:**
   After all the above steps, Brendan ends up with:
   \[
   \boxed{7} \text{ marbles}
   \]
