Q: Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?

Okay, so Jay is making snowballs for a snowball fight. He can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but every 15 minutes, 2 of them melt. He wants to have 60 snowballs. Hmm, let me figure out how long it will take him.

First, let me break down the problem. Jay makes snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour. But every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, I need to consider both his making and melting rates.

Wait, 20 snowballs in an hour. That means his rate is 20 per 60 minutes? Wait, no, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 20 per hour. So, his rate is 20 snowballs per hour, which is 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute. Hmm, that seems slow, but okay.

But then, every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in 15 minutes, he makes 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs, but then 2 melt. So, net gain per 15 minutes is (1/3 - 2) snowballs. Wait, that can't be right because 1/3 is less than 2. So, that would mean he's losing snowballs over time.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of snowballs per hour. Let me see.

He makes 20 snowballs in an hour. But every 15 minutes, 2 melt. So, in 15 minutes, he makes 20/4 = 5 snowballs, because in an hour, there are 4 sets of 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he makes 5/4 = 1.25 snowballs. But that seems messy.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate how many snowballs he makes and melts over a certain period.

Let me think in terms of 15-minute intervals because the melting happens every 15 minutes.

In each 15-minute interval, he makes 20/4 = 5 snowballs, because in 60 minutes, he makes 20, so in 15 minutes, it's 2/12 = 5? Wait, no, 20 in 60 is 20 per hour, so 20 per 60 minutes, so per 15 minutes, it's 20/4 = 5. So, he makes 5 snowballs in 15 minutes.

But then, every 15 minutes, 2 melt. So, net gain per 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

So, every 15 minutes, he gains 3 snowballs.

He wants to have 60 snowballs. So, how many 15-minute intervals does he need to reach 60?

Wait, but he starts with 0 snowballs, right? Or does he start making snowballs? The problem doesn't specify, so I think he starts with 0, and he wants to reach 60.

So, let's model this.

Let t be the time in minutes.

In each 15-minute interval, he gains 3 snowballs.

So, the number of snowballs after n intervals is 3n.

We need 3n = 60.

So, n = 20.

Each interval is 15 minutes, so total time is 20 * 15 = 300 minutes.

Wait, 300 minutes is 5 hours. That seems a lot, but let me check.

Wait, if he makes 5 snowballs every 15 minutes, and 2 melt, so net 3 per 15 minutes.

So, 3 per 15 minutes, so 60 per 30 minutes, 90 per 45 minutes, 120 per 60 minutes, 150 per 75 minutes, 180 per 90 minutes, 210 per 100 minutes, 240 per 115 minutes, 270 per 130 minutes, 300 per 145 minutes, 330 per 160 minutes, 360 per 175 minutes, 390 per 190 minutes, 420 per 200 minutes, 450 per 235 minutes, 480 per 250 minutes, 510 per 265 minutes, 540 per 280 minutes, 570 per 295 minutes, 600 per 31
