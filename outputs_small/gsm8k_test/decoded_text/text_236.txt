Q: Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ram and his pens. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ram uses a lot of pens. He found out that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. So, essentially, if he has five empty pens, he can combine their ink to make one full pen. That seems like a good deal because he can save money by not buying a new pen each time he needs one.

Now, the problem states that Ram buys 25 pens. So, he starts with 25 pens. Then, he uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. The question is, how many total pens does he get to have?

Hmm, okay. So, initially, he has 25 pens. Each of these pens has some ink. If he uses the ink from five pens to make one full pen, he can exchange five pens for one pen. So, for every five pens he has, he can make one new pen. 

Wait, so if he has 25 pens, he can make 25/5 = 5 pens. So, he can make 5 new pens from the 25 he bought. But then, those new pens also have ink, right? So, the ink from those 5 new pens can be used to make more pens. 

So, let me think about this. He starts with 25 pens. He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he now has 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 pens. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when he uses the ink from five pens to make one, he's not just replacing them with one, but he's also using the ink to make a new pen. So, actually, he's not just reducing the number of pens by 5, but he's also increasing it by 1. So, the net change is +1 pen.

Wait, so if he starts with 25 pens, and he can make 5 new pens from them, he would have 25 - 5 + 5 = 25 pens. But that doesn't make sense because he's using the ink to make more pens, so he should have more pens. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me try to break it down. He has 25 pens. Each pen has some ink. He can exchange five pens for one full pen. So, each time he does this, he's effectively converting five pens into one pen, which means he's losing four pens and gaining one. So, each exchange reduces the total number of pens by four.

Wait, so if he has 25 pens, and he can exchange five pens for one, how many exchanges can he do? Let's see. 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, he can do this five times. Each time, he's replacing five pens with one, so each exchange reduces the total number of pens by four. So, 25 pens, after one exchange, he has 25 - 4 = 21 pens. After the second exchange, 21 -4 =17 pens. Third exchange: 17 pens. Fourth exchange: 13 pens. Fifth exchange: 9 pens.

Wait, so after five exchanges, he would have 25 - 5*4 = 25 -20 =5 pens. But that seems like he's only getting 5 pens in total. But that doesn't seem right because he started with 25 pens, and each exchange is converting five pens into one, so he's not just reducing the number but also increasing it. Wait, no, each exchange is replacing five pens with one, so the total number of pens decreases by four each time.

Wait, let me think again. If he has 25 pens, he can make 1 pen. So, he started with 25 pens, and he can make 5 pens, each time replacing five pens with one. So, each time, he's replacing five pens with one, so the number of pens he has is 25 -5 +1 =21. So, each exchange reduces the total number of pens by four.

So, starting with 25 pens, after one exchange, he has 21 pen. After two exchanges, 21 -4=17 pens. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, each exchange is replacing five pens with one, so each exchange reduces the total number of pens by four. So, 25 pens, after one exchange, 21 pens. After two exchanges, 21 -4=17 pens. Wait, that seems like a lot.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to
