Q: Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Hunter counting cars in a school parking lot. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered the school in the morning. So, that's 50 cars. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Hmm, so I think that means after the first break, the total number of cars in the parking lot increased by 20. 

Wait, let me make sure. So, initially, there were 50 cars. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more. So, does that mean the total number of cars became 50 + 20? That would be 70 cars. Yeah, that makes sense. So, after the first break, there are 70 cars in total.

But then, when he got out of class for lunch, he realized that half the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. Hmm, okay. So, half the cars had left. So, if there are 70 cars now, half of them would have gone. So, how many cars went? That would be 70 divided by 2, which is 35. So, 35 cars had left.

Wait, but the question is asking for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. So, he counted 20 more cars during the first break, and then when he got out, he realized that half the number had gone. So, does that mean he counted 20 more cars during lunch?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?"

So, he counted 50 cars in the morning. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more. So, that's 50 + 20 = 70 cars. Then, when he got out for lunch, he realized that half the number of cars had gone. So, half the cars had left. So, if there were 70 cars after the first break, half of them had gone, so 35 cars had left. So, the number of cars remaining would be 70 -35 =35 cars.

But the question is asking for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. So, he counted 20 more cars during the first break, and then when he got out, he realized that half the number had gone. So, does that mean he counted 20 cars during lunch break?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the problem again.

He counted 50 cars in the morning. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more cars. So, that's 50 +20 =70 cars. Then, when he got out for lunch, he realized that half the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. So, half the cars had left. So, the number of cars he counted during lunch break is 20, right? Because he counted 20 more during the first break, and then when he got out, half the cars had gone, so he didn't count the remaining ones.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. So, maybe it's 20 + something else? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. So, initially, 50 cars. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more, so total cars became 70. Then, when he got out, half the number of cars had gone. So, half of 70 had gone, which is 35. So, 35 cars had left. So, the number of cars he counted during lunch break is 20, because he counted 20 more during the first break, and then when he got out, he realized that 1/2 the number had gone. So, he didn't count the remaining 35 cars.

Wait, but the question is asking for the total number of cars he counted during lunch break. So, he counted 20 more during the first break, and then when he got out, he realized that half the number had gone. So, does that mean he counted 20 during lunch break? Or is it 20 plus something else?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the total number of cars he counted during the entire day. So, he counted 50
