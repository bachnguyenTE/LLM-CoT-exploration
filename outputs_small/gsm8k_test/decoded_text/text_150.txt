Q: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Okay, so Steve and Tim are racing to get home from school, and I need to figure out how long the winner will wait before the loser finishes. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's note down the given information:

- Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute.
- Tim lives 2 miles from the school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute.
- We need to find out how long the winner will wait before the loser finishes the race.

Hmm, okay. So, both of them have different distances to cover and different speeds. I think I need to calculate the time each of them takes to get home from school and then find the difference between those times to see how long the waiting time is.

Let me recall the formula for time, which is:

Time = Distance / Speed

But wait, the distance is given in miles, and the speed is in feet per minute. I need to make sure the units are consistent. So, I should convert miles to feet because the speed is in feet per minute.

I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet. So, let me convert both distances to feet.

Starting with Steve:

Steve lives 3 miles from the school. So, in feet, that's 3 * 5280.

Let me calculate that:

3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet.

Okay, so Steve has to bike 15,840 feet.

His speed is 440 feet per minute. So, the time he takes is:

Time = 15,840 / 440 minutes.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 440 goes into 15,840 how many times?

Well, 440 * 36 = 15,840 because 440*30=13,200 and 440*6=2,640, so 13,200 + 2,640 = 15,840. So, 36 minutes.

Wait, let me check that again. 440 * 36.

440 * 30 = 13,200

440 * 6 = 2,640

13,200 + 2,640 = 15,840. Yes, that's correct. So, Steve takes 36 minutes.

Now, let's do the same for Tim.

Tim lives 2 miles from the school. Converting that to feet:

2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet.

His speed is 264 feet per minute. So, the time he takes is:

Time = 10,560 / 264 minutes.

Let me compute that. 264 goes into 10,560 how many times?

Well, 264 * 40 = 10,560 because 264*40 is 264*(40) = 10,560. So, 40 minutes.

Wait, let me verify that. 264*40: 264*4=1,056, so 1,056*10=10,560. Yes, correct. So, Tim takes 40 minutes.

So, Steve takes 36 minutes, Tim takes 40 minutes.

Now, the question is, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

So, if Steve is faster, he will finish before Tim. So, the waiting time would be the difference between their times.

So, 40 minutes (Tim's time) minus 36 minutes (Steve's time) is 4 minutes.

Therefore, the winner, Tim, will wait 4 minutes at Steve's house before he finishes the race.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up who is faster. Steve is faster because he takes less time. So, yes, Tim is the slower one, so he will wait for Steve.

So, the waiting time is 4 minutes.

I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The winner will wait for the loser for \boxed{4} minutes.

Steve and Tim are racing to get home from school. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from the school and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. We need to determine how long the winner will wait before the loser finishes the race.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles
