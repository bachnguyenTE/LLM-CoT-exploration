Q: When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?

Okay, so Marcus wakes up to his house being 40 degrees. Hmm, wait, the question says 40 degrees, but in the initial statement, it's 40 degrees. Let me check: "When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees." Wait, that's a typo. It should be 40 degrees, right? Because 40 is not a standard temperature. So, I think it's 40 degrees. Okay, moving on.

He spends 3 hours baking. Every hour, the oven is on, which raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, first, I need to figure out how much the temperature increases during baking. He's baking for 3 hours, and each hour it goes up by 5 degrees. So, 3 hours times 5 degrees per hour. Let me write that down: 3 * 5 = 15 degrees. So, the temperature goes up by 15 degrees during baking.

So, starting at 40 degrees, adding 15 degrees, that would be 40 + 15 = 55 degrees. Okay, so after baking, the temperature is 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, first, I need to figure out how much the temperature drops during the window. The window is open for 30 minutes. So, 30 minutes divided by 10 minutes per 2 degrees. Let me calculate that: 30 /10 = 30. So, 30 intervals of 10 minutes each. Each interval causes a 2-degree drop. So, 30 * 2 = 66 degrees. Wait, that can't be right. 30 * 2 is 60, not 66. Wait, 30 divided by 10 is 3, not 30. Wait, no, 30 minutes divided by 10 minutes per 2 degrees. So, 30 /10 = 3. So, 3 intervals, each causing a 2-degree drop. So, 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. So, the temperature drops by 6 degrees.

So, starting from 55 degrees, subtract 6 degrees, that's 55 -6 = 49 degrees. So, the final temperature is 49 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check. Starting at 40 degrees, baking for 3 hours, each hour 5 degrees, so 15 degrees. 40 +15=55. Then, window open for 30 minutes, cooling 2 degrees every 10 minutes. 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, so 3 *2=6 degrees. 55 -6=49. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, and the cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, which is 0.1666 degrees per minute. So, 30 minutes would be 30 * 0.1666 = 5 degrees. Wait, that's different. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the cooling rate.

Wait, the problem says: "the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open." So, 2 degrees per 10 minutes. So, 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, so 3 *2=6 degrees. So, 55 -6=49. So, that's correct.

But wait, if I think of it as 30 minutes, which is 30/10=30, but the cooling is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, so 30 minutes is 30/10=3, so 3*2=6. So, 55-6=49. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 30 minutes is 30, but 30 minutes is 30, so 30/10=30, but 30 minutes is 30, so 30*2=66? Wait, no, 30 minutes is 30, but 30 minutes is 30, so 30/10=30, but 30 is 30, so 30 minutes is 30, so 30/10=30, so 30*2=60. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. If the cooling is 2 degrees
