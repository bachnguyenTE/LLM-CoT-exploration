Q: In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two classes in a school. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that there are two classes with a total of 80 students. Each class has the same number of students, and in each class, 40% of the students are girls. I need to find out how many boys are in each class. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the total number of students in both classes combined is 80. Since there are two classes and each has the same number of students, I can find out how many students are in each class individually. To do that, I should divide the total number of students by 2. So, 80 divided by 2 is 40. That means each class has 40 students. Wait, that seems a bit low, but okay, maybe it's correct.

Now, each class has 40% of its students as girls. So, in each class, 40% are girls, and the rest must be boys. Since the total number of students in each class is 40, I can calculate the number of girls in each class first. To find 40% of 40, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 40% is 0.40 in decimal form. Then, 0.40 multiplied by 40 gives me the number of girls in each class.

Let me do that multiplication: 0.40 * 40. Hmm, 0.4 times 40 is 16, right? Because 0.4 is the same as 4/10, so 4/10 of 40 is 16. So, there are 16 girls in each class. That makes sense because 40% of 40 is 16.

Now, since each class has 40 students in total and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys. So, to find the number of boys, I subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class. That would be 40 minus 16. Let me do that subtraction: 40 - 16 is 24. So, there are 24 boys in each class.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each class has 40 students, and 40% are girls, then 40% of 40 is 16 girls, and the rest, which is 24, must be boys. That seems right. So, each class has 24 boys.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. Total students: 80. Each class has half of that, so 40 each. 40% of 40 is 16 girls, so 40 - 16 is 24 boys. Yeah, that seems consistent.

I think that's the answer. Each class has 24 boys. So, the number of boys in each class is 24.

**Final Answer**
The number of boys in each class is \boxed{24}.

The total number of students in both classes is 80. Since each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class:

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Each class has 40 students. In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[
0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

Thus, there are 16 girls in each class. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[
40 - 16 = 24
\]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \boxed{24}.
