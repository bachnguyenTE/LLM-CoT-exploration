Q: Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Eliza's earnings for the week. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week. That means if she works 40 hours, she gets $10 each hour. But she also gets overtime pay for any hours she works beyond 40. The overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So, I need to calculate her earnings for 45 hours of work this week.

Alright, let me break it down. She worked 45 hours, which is more than 40. So, the first 40 hours are regular time, and the remaining 1 hour is overtime. 

Let me write down the information:

- Regular hourly rate: $10/hour
- Overtime rate: 1.2 times regular rate
- Total hours worked: 45
- Regular hours: 40
- Overtime hours: 45 - 40 = 1

So, her earnings can be calculated by adding the earnings from regular hours and the earnings from overtime.

First, let's calculate the regular earnings. That's 40 hours multiplied by $10 per hour.

Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour

Hmm, 40 times 10 is... 400. So, $400 for the regular hours.

Now, for the overtime. She worked 1 hour at 1.2 times her regular rate. So, let's calculate that.

Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour

1.2 times 10 is 12. So, her overtime pay is $12 for 1 hour.

Therefore, her total earnings for the week are regular earnings plus overtime earnings.

Total earnings = $400 + $12

Adding those together, $400 + $12 is $412.

Wait, let me double-check that. 40 hours at $10 is 40*10=400. 1 hour at 1.2*10=12. So, 400+12=412. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Eliza earned $412 for the week.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with overtime, it's easy to mix up the rates or the hours. Let me verify each step.

Regular hours: 40, rate $10. 40*10=400. That's correct.

Overtime hours: 45-40=5. Wait, hold on, wait a second. Wait, 45 hours total. So, 40 regular, 5 overtime? But the problem says she gets overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular rate. So, 1.2*10=12 per hour. So, 5 hours would be 5*12=60. Wait, no, 5*12 is 60. Wait, but 45 hours is 40 regular and 1 overtime? Wait, no, 45-40=5, so 5 overtime hours. But 1.2 times 10 is 12 per hour, so 5*12=60. So, total earnings would be 400+60=460. Wait, that's different from what I had before.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says she works 45 hours. So, 40 regular hours and 1 overtime hour? But 1.2 times 10 is 12, so 1 hour is 12. So, 40*10=400, 1*12=12, total 452. Wait, that's different.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The problem says: "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate."

So, that means for the first 40 hours, she gets $10 per hour, and for any hours beyond 40, she gets 1.2 times that rate, which is $12 per hour.

So, if she works 45 hours, that's 40 regular hours and 5 overtime hours? Wait, no, 45 hours is 40 regular and 1 overtime. Wait, 45-4
