Q: Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Emil, his dad, and his brother. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. 

Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. We need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now.

Alright, so let's break this down. 

Emil is 19 now. When he turns 24, that's in 5 years because 24 minus 19 is 5. So, in 5 years, Emil will be 24. At that time, he will be half as old as his dad. So, if I let D represent the dad's age when Emil is 24, then D must be twice 24, right? Because he'll be half his dad's age. So, D = 2 * 24 = 48. So, the dad will be 48 when Emil is 24. 

Wait, but we need the dad's current age, not when he's 24. So, we need to figure out how old the dad is now. 

Let me think. If in 5 years, the dad will be 48, then his current age must be 48 minus 5, which is 43. So, the dad is currently 43 years old. 

But let me double-check that. If the dad is 43 now, then in 5 years he'll be 48. And at that time, Emil will be 24, which is half of 48. That makes sense. So, the dad is 43 now. 

Now, the problem also says that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So, when Emil is 24, his brother's age would be half of 24, which is 12. So, the brother is currently 12 years old. 

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If the brother is 12 now, then in 5 years, he'll be 17. But when Emil is 24, his brother will be 12. So, that seems consistent. 

So, the brother is currently 12 years old. 

Now, the question is asking for the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. So, that would be 43 (dad) plus 12 (brother). 

43 plus 12 is 55. So, the sum of their ages now is 55. 

Wait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Emil is 19 now. In 5 years, he'll be 24. At that time, he'll be half the dad's age, so dad will be 48. Therefore, dad is currently 43. 

When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, so 12. Therefore, brother is currently 12. 

Sum of dad and brother's ages: 43 + 12 = 55. 

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm. 

Alternatively, let's assign variables to the current ages. Let me denote:

E = Emil's current age = 19

D = Dad's current age

B = Brother's current age

We need to find D + B.

We know that when Emil is 24, which is in 5 years, his dad will be half his age. So, in 5 years:

E + 5 = 24

D + 5 = 2 * (E + 5)

So, substituting E =19:

24 = 2 * (19 +5) = 2*24=48

So, D +5 =48 => D=43

So, dad is 43 now.

Also, when Emil is 24, his brother will be half of that, so 12. So, in 5 years, brother will be 12, so his current age is 12 -5=7. Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, hold on, that's a problem. Earlier, I thought the brother is 12 now, but now I'm getting 7. So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me clarify. 

Emil is 19 now. When he turns 24, that's 5 years from now. At that time, his dad will be
