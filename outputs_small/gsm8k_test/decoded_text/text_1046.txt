Q: A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in?

Okay, so I have this problem here: A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's asking for the total number of hours each painter worked. So, I guess I need to calculate the total work done by all the painters combined and then divide that by the number of painters to find out how much each one contributed.

Alright, let's break it down. The team consists of 4 painters. They worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks. I need to find the total hours each painter worked.

Wait, so first, I should figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. Since a week has 7 days, 3 weeks would be 3 times 7, right? Let me write that down.

3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

So, they worked for 21 days in total.

Now, each day, each painter worked for 3/8 of a day. So, for one painter, the total number of days they worked is 21 days multiplied by 3/8 of a day each.

Let me calculate that.

Total days per painter = 21 * (3/8)

Hmm, 21 divided by 8 is... let me see, 8 goes into 21 two times with a remainder. 21 divided by 8 is 2.625. Then, multiplying by 3, that's 7.875 days.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should convert 3/8 of a day into hours first. Because the question asks for hours, not days.

So, 3/8 of a day is how many hours? Since a day has 24 hours, 3/8 of 24 hours is...

Let me compute that.

3/8 * 24 = (3 * 24)/8 = 72/8 = 9 hours.

Oh, that's easier. So each painter worked 9 hours each day.

So, each painter worked 9 hours per day. Now, over 21 days, how many hours did each painter work?

Total hours per painter = 9 hours/day * 21 days.

Let me calculate that.

9 * 21 = 189 hours.

Wait, 9 times 20 is 180, plus 9 is 189. So, 189 hours per painter.

But hold on, let me double-check my steps because that seems like a lot of hours. 4 painters working 189 hours each over 3 weeks? That seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me go back.

First, 3 weeks is 21 days. Each day, each painter works 3/8 of a day. So, per day, each painter works 3/8 of a day. So, 3/8 of a day is 9 hours, as I calculated earlier.

So, each painter works 9 hours each day. Then, over 21 days, that's 9 * 21 = 189 hours.

Hmm, 189 hours per painter. That seems correct, but let me think about it another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total work done in painter-hours and then divide by the number of painters.

Total work done is 4 painters * 21 days * (3/8 day per day). Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, each painter works 3/8 of a day each day, so per day, the total painter-hours is 4 painters * 3/8 day = 12/8 = 1.5 days. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it. Let me clarify.

Each painter works 3/8 of a day each day. So, per day, the total work done is 4 painters * 3/8 day = 12/8 = 1.5 painter-days per day.

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, 4 painters each working 3/8 of a day is 4*(3/8) = 12/8 = 1.5 painter-days per day.

But that seems low. Wait, 1.5 painter-days per day? That would mean that each day, 1.5 painter-hours are worked.

Wait, no, hold on. 3/8 of a day is 9 hours, right? So, 4 painters working 9 hours each day is
