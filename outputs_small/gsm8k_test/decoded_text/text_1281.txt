Q: Dexter has five pigs. Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, which means each pig consumes 8 pounds of feed per day.

With five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is 5 pigs multiplied by 8 pounds per pig, resulting in 40 pounds of feed per day.

Over a week, the total feed consumed would be 40 pounds per day multiplied by 7 days, which equals 280 pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed initially. After consuming 288 pounds over the week, the remaining feed would be 300 pounds minus 288 pounds, leaving 42 pounds of feed.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption per pig:**
   
   Each pig eats:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/day} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total daily feed consumption for all pigs:**
   
   With 5 pigs:
   \[
   5 \text{ pigs} \times 8 \text{ pounds/pig/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Find the total feed consumed in a week:**
   
   There are 7 days in a week:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining feed after the week:**
   
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds initially. After consuming 288 pounds:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 288 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
