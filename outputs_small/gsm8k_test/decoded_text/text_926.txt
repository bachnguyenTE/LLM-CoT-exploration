Q: Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?

Okay, so Colby wants to go to the movies every month, and his parents give him $150 each month to spend. The tickets for Fridays and Saturdays are $10 each, and for any other day, they're $7. He also buys popcorn for $8 and candy for $2. It's the last day of the month, so it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and a box of candy that night. 

He already saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, 8 on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy that month. The question is, how many movies can he see if he already saw 5 on Fridays or Saturdays, 8 on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy that month?

Wait, hold on. Let me read that again. It says, "How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?"

Hmm, so he's already seen 5 on Fridays or Saturdays, 8 on other days, 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy. So, he's already spent some money on the movies and some on popcorn and candy. The question is, how many more movies can he see in the month, given that he has $150 each month to spend.

Wait, but the problem is asking "how many movies can he see if he already saw 5 on Fridays or Saturdays, 8 on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?" So, he's already spent some money on the movies and some on popcorn and candy. So, we need to figure out how much money he's already spent, and then see how much money he has left, and then figure out how many more movies he can see.

So, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much money he's spent on the movies. He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and 8 on other days. Each Friday or Saturday ticket is $10, and each other day ticket is $7. So, the total cost for the movies is (5 * 10) + (8 * 7). Let me calculate that.

5 * 10 is $50, and 8 * 7 is $56. So, 50 + 56 is $106. So, he's spent $106 on movies.

Next, he bought 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy. Each tub is $8, and each box is $2. So, the total cost for popcorn is 2 * 8 = $16, and for candy is 4 * 2 = $8. So, total spent on popcorn and candy is 16 + 8 = $24.

So, total money spent so far is $106 (movies) + $24 (popcorn and candy) = $130.

Wait, hold on, 24? Wait, 16 + 8 is 24, yes. So, total spent is $130.

He has $150 each month, so the remaining money is 150 - 130 = $20.

Now, he wants to see as many more movies as possible with the remaining $20. But, he can only see movies on Fridays or Saturdays, or other days. So, we need to figure out how many more movies he can see, given that each Friday or Saturday ticket is $10, and others are $7.

But, wait, he already saw 5 on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 on other days. So, the remaining movies he can see are on other days or Fridays/Saturdays, but he wants to maximize the number of movies he can see, so he should see as many as possible on the cheaper day, which is Friday or Saturday.

But, wait, he already saw 5 on Friday or Saturday, so he can't see more on Friday or Saturday because he's already seen all 5. So, he can only see more on other days, which are $7 each.

So, with $20, how many more movies can he see on other days? Each is $7, so 20 divided by 7 is 2 with a remainder of 6. So, he can see 2 more movies on other days, and have $6 left, which isn't enough for another movie.

But wait, let me check. 20 divided by 7 is 2 with a remainder of 6, so yes, 2 more movies, and $6 left.

But, hold on,
