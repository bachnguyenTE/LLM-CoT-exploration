Q: Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. He also purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. How much did he pay in total in dollars?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. Multiplying the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle gives the total cost for the popsicles.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. He purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. Multiplying the number of bars by the price per bar gives the total cost for the ice cream bars.

Finally, I'll add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the overall amount Peter paid.

**Solution:**

Let's calculate the total amount Peter paid for the popsicles and ice cream bars step by step.

1. **Cost of Popsicles:**
   - Number of popsicles: 20
   - Price per popsicle: \$0.250
   - Total cost for popsicles = Number × Price
   \[
   \text{Total cost for popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00
   \]

2. **Cost of Ice Cream Bars:**
   - Number of ice cream bars: 4
   - Price per ice cream bar: \$0.50
   - Total cost for ice cream bars = Number × Price
   \[
   \text{Total cost for ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00
   \]

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Add the total costs of popsicles and ice cream bars
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$7.00}
\]
