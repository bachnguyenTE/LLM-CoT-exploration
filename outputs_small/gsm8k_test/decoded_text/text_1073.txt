Q: Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Robles buying bananas for his monkeys. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough for his three monkeys for a week. Hmm, okay, so 315 bananas for a week. That means each monkey eats a certain number of bananas per day, right? 

It also mentions that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Let me note that down. So, Monkey 1 eats 10 bananas per day. 

Then, it says the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. So, if the first monkey eats 10, the second one eats 10 + 4, which is 14 bananas per day. Got that. 

Now, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. So, I need to figure out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. 

Wait, but before that, let me make sure I understand the total number of bananas. It says 315 bananas for a week. So, 315 bananas over 7 days. That means each monkey eats a certain number of bananas per day. 

But hold on, is 315 the total for all three monkeys for a week, or is it the total for each monkey? Hmm, the wording says "315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week." So, 315 bananas in total for all three monkeys for a week. 

So, each monkey eats a certain number of bananas per day, and over 7 days, the total is 315. So, the total consumption per day is 315 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 

315 divided by 7. Let me do the division: 7 goes into 315 how many times? 7 times 45 is 315, right? Because 7 times 40 is 280, and 7 times 5 is 35, so 280 + 35 is 315. So, 315 divided by 7 is 45. So, each day, the three monkeys together eat 45 bananas. 

So, each day, the three monkeys eat 45 bananas. 

Now, we know that Monkey 1 eats 10 bananas per day, Monkey 2 eats 14 more than Monkey 1, so that's 14 bananas more. So, Monkey 2 eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. 

So, Monkey 1 eats 10, Monkey 2 eats 14. So, together, Monkey 1 and Monkey 2 eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day. 

Therefore, the third monkey must eat the remaining bananas. So, total per day is 45, and Monkey 1 and 2 together eat 24, so Monkey 3 eats 45 - 24. Let me compute that. 

45 minus 24 is 21. So, Monkey 3 eats 21 bananas per day. 

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 10 + 14 is 24, and 45 - 24 is 21. Yeah, that seems right. 

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial division. 315 divided by 7 is 45. Yes, because 7 times 40 is 280, and 7 times 5 is 35, so 280 + 35 is 315. So, that's correct. 

And then, 10 + 14 is 24, so 45 - 24 is 21. So, 21 bananas per day for the third monkey. 

Wait, but the problem says "the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day." So, that makes sense because 10 + 14 + 21 is 45, which is the total per day. 

So, that seems to add up. 

But just to make sure, let me think about the total bananas. 315 bananas for a week. So, each day, 45 bananas are consumed by all three monkeys. So, 45 bananas per day. 

So, each monkey's consumption per day is 10, 14, and 21. So, 10, 14, 21. Let me add those up: 10 + 14 is 24, plus 21 is 25
