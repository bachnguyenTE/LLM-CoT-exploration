Q: Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tim decided to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services instead. Let me try to figure out how much he's saving. Hmm, the cable package he had was $60, right? So, he's going to get Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus instead. 

First, let me break down the costs. Netflix is $10 a month, Hulu is also $10 a month, and Disney Plus is $10 a month. So, if he cancels his cable package, he's not paying $60 a month anymore. But wait, he's getting these three services instead. 

But hold on, the question says he gets Netflix for $10 a month. Oh, okay, so that's different. It wasn't $10 a month before. So, he's paying $10 for Netflix, $10 for Hulu, and $10 for Disney Plus. Let me add those up. 

So, $10 Netflix + $10 Hulu + $10 Disney Plus equals... let me see, $1 + $10 is $11, and then plus $10 is $21. So, he's paying $21 a month for the three services. 

But he was paying $60 for his cable package. So, to find out how much he's saving, I need to subtract the cost of the three services from the original cable package. 

So, $60 cable package minus $21 for the streaming services. Let me do that subtraction. $60 minus $2 is $60, and then minus another $1 is $61. So, he's saving $61 a month by getting these streaming services instead of the cable package. 

Wait, but the question mentions he saves 20% for bundling. Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. Let me read that again. "He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling." 

So, normally, each of Hulu and Disney Plus would be $10, but he saves 20% on those two. So, instead of paying $10 for Hulu and $10 for Disney Plus, he only pays 20% less. 

Let me calculate that. 20% of $10 is $2, so he saves $2 on each of those two services. So, for Hulu and Disney Plus, he saves $2 + $2 = $4. 

So, in total, he's saving $4 on the two streaming services. But he also got Netflix for $10, which is a flat rate. So, the total savings would be the $4 from the two services plus the $10 for Netflix. 

Wait, but hold on. The original cable package was $60, and he's getting three services. So, maybe the saving is the difference between the cable package and the three services. 

So, the three services cost $21, as I calculated earlier, and the cable package was $60. So, the saving is $60 - $21 = $39. 

But the question also mentions he saves 20% for bundling. So, maybe the saving is 20% of the cable package, which is $12, but that doesn't seem right because he's getting three services. 

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The cable package was $60, and he's getting three services that cost $21. So, the saving is $60 - $21 = $39. 

But the question also says he saves 20% for bundling. So, maybe the saving is 20% of the cable package, which is $12, but that doesn't match with the $39 saving. 

I'm getting confused here. Let me try to parse the question again. 

"Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable package and get streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling. How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?"

So, the key points are:

1. Canceled a $60 cable package.
2. Gets Netflix for $10.
3. Hulu and Disney Plus normally $10 each, but he saves 20% for bundling.

So, the saving is the difference between the cable package and the three services. 

So, the three services cost Netflix + Hulu + Disney Plus. But wait, is that $10 + $10 + $10? Or is it $10 each? 

Wait, the question says: "He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally
