Q: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?

Okay, so I have this problem here about three truck drivers: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary. Each has a truck that can carry a certain amount of gravel. The problem gives me some information, and I need to figure out how much Gary's truck can carry. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what I know:

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Wait, that seems like a typo. It should probably be 4,000 pounds, right? Because 4,000 is a bit confusing. I'll assume it's 4,000 pounds. So, Gissela's truck capacity is 4,000 pounds.

2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's. Hmm, so Gordy's capacity is Gissela's plus 800. Since Gissela can carry 4,000, then Gordy can carry 4,000 + 800. Let me calculate that. 4,000 + 800 is 4,800 pounds. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds.

3. When Gary joins Gissela, Gordy, and brings his own truck, the combined capacity is 11,600 pounds. So, all three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds. I need to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

Let me denote the capacity of Gary's truck as G. So, G is what we're trying to find.

So, Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds.

Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds.

Gary's truck: G pounds.

Combined, they can carry 11,600 pounds. So, adding all three together:

4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 4,000 is Gissela's, 4,800 is Gordy's, and G is Gary's. So, 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600.

Wait, 4,000 + 4,800 is 8,800. So, 8,800 + G = 11,600.

Therefore, G = 11,600 - 8,800.

Let me compute that. 11,600 minus 8,800. Hmm, 11,600 minus 8,000 is 3,600, and then minus 800 more is 2,800. So, G is 2,800 pounds.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky.

So, Gissela can carry 4,000, Gordy can carry 4,800, and together with Gary, they can carry 11,600. So, 4,000 + 4,800 is 8,800, so 11,600 - 8,800 is 2,800. So, yes, that seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misread the numbers. The problem says Gissela's truck is 4,000 pounds, which is 4,000. Gordy's is 800 more, so 4,000 + 800 is 4,800. Then all three together can carry 11,600. So, 4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600. So, 8,800 + G = 11,600. So, G = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800. So, 2,800 pounds.

Wait, but 2,800 is 2,800, not 2,800. Wait, no, 2,800 is 2,800, but 2,800 is 2,800. Wait, maybe I made a typo in the initial numbers.

Wait, let me check the problem again.

It says: Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. So, 4
