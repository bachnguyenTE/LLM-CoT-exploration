Q: The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?

Okay, so I have this problem here about the Hortex company producing bottled carrot juices. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

Every day, Hortex can make 4200 bottles of juice. Each of these bottles can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, if I have one bottle, it's enough for 20% of someone. The question is asking how many more bottles Hortex would need to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the total energy demand for 2300 people. Then, since each bottle covers 20% of someone's energy, I can find out how many bottles are needed for 100% of that demand. Finally, I'll subtract the number of bottles Hortex already produces each day to find out how many more they need to make.

Let me write this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.**

   Each person needs 100% of their daily energy. So, for one person, it's 100% of their energy. But wait, the problem says each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy. So, actually, each bottle is 20% per person. 

   So, for one person, the energy demand is 100% per day. Therefore, the total energy needed for 2300 people would be 2300 people multiplied by 100% per person.

   Let me compute that:

   Total energy needed = 2300 people * 100% per person.

   But wait, percentages can be tricky. Let me think. If each person needs 100% of their energy, then 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that seems too high. Wait, no, actually, each person's energy is 100%, so 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that can't be right because 100% is the total. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

   Let me think differently. If each person needs 100% of their energy, then 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that seems like a lot. Wait, no, actually, 100% is the total, so 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that doesn't make sense because 100% is the total. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something.

   Let me try another approach. If each person needs 100% of their energy, then 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that seems like a lot. Wait, no, actually, 100% is the total, so 2300 people would need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of the total energy. But that can't be right because 100% is the total. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

   Let me think in terms of fractions. Each person needs 100% of their energy, which is 1. So, 2300 people would need 2300 * 1 = 2300 units of energy. But each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy, which is 0.2. So, each bottle covers 0.2 units of energy.

   Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is total energy needed divided by energy per bottle.

   So, total bottles needed = 2300 / 0.2.

   Let me compute that.

   2300 divided by 0.2. Hmm, 2300 / 0.2 is the same as 2300 * 5, because 1 / 0.2 is 5. So, 2300 * 5 = 11500.

   Wait, so 2300 people, each needing 100% of their energy, which is 1, so total energy is 2300
