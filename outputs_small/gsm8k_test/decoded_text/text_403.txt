Q: Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mel using an air conditioner. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. That means each hour, it uses 900 watts. So, if he uses it for 8 hours, the total energy used in a day would be 900 watts multiplied by 8 hours. Let me write that down:

Energy per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts-hour.

Hmm, wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 900 times 8... 900 times 8 is 7200. Yeah, that's right. So, he uses 7200 watts-hour of energy each day.

Now, the question is asking how much he will save if he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day. So, originally, he uses it for 8 hours, and if he reduces it by 5 hours, he'll use it for 3 hours a day. 

Let me calculate the new daily energy usage. That would be 900 watts multiplied by 3 hours:

New energy per day = 900 * 3 = 2700 watts-hour.

So, the energy saved each day is the original usage minus the new usage. That would be:

Energy saved per day = 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts-hour.

Wait, 7200 minus 2700 is 4500. Yeah, that's correct. So, he saves 4500 watts-hour each day.

But the question asks for the total saving over 30 days. So, I need to multiply the daily saving by 30:

Total saving = 4500 * 30.

Let me compute that. 4500 times 30. Hmm, 4500 times 10 is 45,000, so times 30 is double that, which is 90,000.

Wait, 4500 * 30 is 135,000? Wait, no, hold on. 4500 * 30. Let me do it step by step.

4500 * 30 is 4500 * 3 *10. 4500 *3 is 13500, so times 10 is 135000. Wait, that can't be right because 4500 *30 is 135,000? That seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, 4500 *30 is 4500*3*10. 4500*3 is 13500, so 13500*10 is 135,000. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think about it another way. 4500 per day, over 30 days. So, 4500 *30. 4500*10 is 45,000, so 45,000*3 is 135,000. Yeah, that's correct.

But wait, the question is asking for kilowatts of electric energy saved. So, 135,000 watts-hour is equal to how many kilowatts? Since 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts, so 135,000 watts-hour is 135,000 /1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.

Wait, so he saves 135 kilowatt-hours over 30 days? That seems like a lot, but let me see.

Wait, 4500 watts-hour per day, times 30 days is 135,000 watts-hour, which is 135 kilowatt-hours. Yeah, that's correct.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculations. So, original usage is 900 watts *8 hours=7200. New usage is 900*3=2700. Difference is 7200-2700=4500. Then 4500*30=135,000. Which is 135 kilowatt-hours.

Wait, but 135 kilowatt-hours is a lot. Let me think about it in terms of
