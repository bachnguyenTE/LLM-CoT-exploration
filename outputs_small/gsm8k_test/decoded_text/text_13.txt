Q: Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Okay, so I have this problem about Melanie and her vacuum cleaners. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, then sold 2 more to the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. In the end, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. The question is, how many did she start with?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. It sounds like a word problem involving fractions and maybe some algebra. I think I need to set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let me denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \). That seems like a good starting point.

So, she sold a third at the green house. That means she sold \( \frac{1}{3}x \) vacuum cleaners. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house. So, after selling at the green house and red house, she has \( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \) left.

Wait, let me write that down:

After green house: \( x - \frac{1}{3}x \)

After red house: \( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \)

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold half of \( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \). That means she sold \( \frac{1}{2}(x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2) \) at the orange house.

So, after the orange house, she has half of what was left after the red house. So, the remaining vacuum cleaners would be half of \( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \).

And according to the problem, she has 5 left. So, we can set up the equation:

\( \frac{1}{2}(x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2) = 5 \)

Wait, let me make sure. So, after selling at the green and red houses, she had some number, then she sold half of that at the orange house, and what's left is 5. So, yes, that equation makes sense.

Let me solve this step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \)

Let me combine the like terms. \( x - \frac{1}{3}x \) is the same as \( \frac{2}{3}x \). So, the expression becomes:

\( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \)

So, now, the equation is:

\( \frac{1}{2}(\frac{2}{3}x - 2) = 5 \)

Let me compute the left side:

Multiply \( \frac{1}{2} \) into the parentheses:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x \)

\( \frac{1}{2} \times (-2) = -1 \)

So, the equation simplifies to:

\( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \)

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

Add 1 to both sides:

\( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \)

Multiply both sides by 3:

\( x = 18 \)

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

Wait, let me verify that. Let me plug back into the problem.

She starts with 18.

Sells a third at the green house: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \). So, she has 12 left.

Then, she sells 2 more to the red house: 12 - 2 = 10 left.

Then, she sells half of what's left at the orange house: half of 10 is 5. So, she sells 5, leaving her with 5. That matches the problem.

So, yes, 18 seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes, when setting up equations, it's easy to make a mistake in the order of operations or misinterpret the problem.

Let me re-examine the problem statement:

She sold a third at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If she has 5 left, how many did she start with?

So, the order is green, red, orange. So, the sequence is correct.

So, starting with 18, sold 6 at green, 2 at red, so 10 left
