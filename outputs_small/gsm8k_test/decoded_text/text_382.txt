A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here about Axel and Anna exchanging some pesos. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits his friend Anna, who has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel. The question is asking for the total number of pesos they have together. The answer is labeled as A, but I need to figure out how to get there.

Okay, so let's break this down. I think I need to calculate how many silver and gold pesos each person has and then add them all together. Let me start with Axel.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. That seems straightforward. So, in total, Axel has 50 + 80 = 138 pesos. Wait, hold on, is that right? 50 plus 80 is 138? Hmm, 50 plus 80. Let me add them again: 50 + 80. 50 is fifty, 80 is eighty. So, 50 + 80 is 138. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, moving on Anna. The problem says Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel. So, let's figure out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

First, the silver pesos. Axel has 50, so twice that would be 2 times 50. Let me calculate that: 2 * 50 = 100. So, Anna has 100 silver pesos.

Next, the gold pesos. Axel has 80, and Anna has 40 more than that. So, that would be 80 + 40. Wait, 80 plus 40 is 124. So, Anna has 124 gold pesos.

So, Anna has 100 silver and 124 gold. Let me add those together for her total: 100 + 124. Hmm, 100 plus 124. 100 + 100 is 200, and then 24 more is 224. So, Anna has 224 pesos in total.

Now, to find the total number of pesos they have together, I need to add Axel's total and Anna's total. Axel has 138, and Anna has 224. So, 138 + 224. Let me add those. 138 + 200 is 338, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 138 + 224. Let me do it step by step.

138 + 224. Let's add the units place first: 8 + 4 is 12. So, write down 2 and carry over 1. Then, the tens place: 3 + 2 is 5, plus the carried over 1 is 6. Then, the hundreds place: 1 + 2 is 3. So, putting it together, 362. So, the total number of pesos they have together is 362.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Axel: 50 silver and 80 gold. 50 + 80 is 138. Anna: twice as many silver as Axel, so 2*50=100. 40 more gold than Axel, so 80 +40=124. 100 +124=224. 138 +224=362. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to make sure, let me go through it again. Maybe I can write it out in a table.

Axel:
- Silver: 50
- Gold: 80
- Total: 50 +80=138

Anna:
- Silver: 2*50=100
- Gold:80 +40=124
- Total:100 +124=224

Combined:
- Silver:50 +100=150
- Gold:80 +124=204
- Total:155 +204=359

Wait, hold on, that's different. Wait, 50 +100 is 150, and 80 +124 is 204. 150 +20
