Okay, so I need to figure out how much Molly will pay for catering. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Molly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. Out of these, 10 people want chicken salad, and 6 people want pasta salad. The chicken salad costs $6.50 per person, and the pasta salad is $6 per person. I need to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, there are 16 people invited, but not all of them are going to the party. Specifically, 10 people want chicken salad and 6 people want pasta salad. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because 10 plus 6 is 16, which is the total number of people invited. So does that mean all the invited people are going to have either chicken salad or pasta salad, or is there an overlap?

Wait, hold on. If 10 people want chicken salad and 6 people want pasta salad, and the total number of people invited is 16, then that suggests that all 16 people who want pasta salad are also among the 10 who want chicken salad. Because 10 + 6 is 16, which is the total number of people invited. So that means there is an overlap of 6 people who want both salads. So, in other words, 6 people are going to have both chicken and pasta salad, and the remaining 4 people (since 10 - 6 = 4) are only going to have chicken salad.

So, to calculate the total cost, I need to consider both the chicken salad and the pasta salad. But since 6 people are having both, I don't want to double-count them. So, the total number of people who will have chicken salad is 10, and the total number of people who will have pasta salad is 6. But since 6 people are having both, the total number of unique people is 10 + 6 - 6 = 10. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 10 +6 is 16, but we only have 16 people invited. So, actually, all 16 people are going to have either chicken or pasta or both. So, the total number of people is 16, but the number of people having each salad is 10 and 6, respectively.

So, to find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost for chicken salad and the cost for pasta salad separately and then add them together.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = (Number of people wanting chicken salad * cost per person for chicken) + (Number of people wanting pasta salad * cost per person for pasta)

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = (10 * $6.50) + (6 * $6)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 10 people want chicken salad. Each person costs $6.50. So, 10 multiplied by 6.50.

10 * 6.50 = 65.00

So, the chicken salad will cost $65.00.

Next, 6 people want pasta salad. Each person costs $6. So, 6 multiplied by 6.

6 * 6 = 36.00

So, the pasta salad will cost $36.00.

Now, to find the total amount Molly will pay, I need to add these two amounts together.

Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00

Let me add those.

65 + 36 = 101

So, $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 10 people at $6.50 each: 10 * 6.50. Let me compute that again.

10 * 6.50 = 0.00

1 * 6.50 = 6.50

Adding them together: 0.00 + 6.50 = 6.50

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 10 is 10, so 10 * 6.50.

Wait, 10 * 6.50 is 65.00, not 6.50. Wait, 10 * 6.50 is 65.00, which is $65.00. So that part is correct
