Okay, so I have this problem here about a customer who has a loyalty card. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the customer has a loyalty card that gives them $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. That means for every $20 they spend, they get $1 back. So, if they spend $20, they get $1 back. If they spend $40, they get $2 back, and so on. 

Now, their last shopping trip was $80. So, they spent $80 last time. But this time, they spent $43. Hmm, okay. So, they spent $43 on this trip. 

Then, they used their rewards. The problem says they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Hmm, so the rewards they get are based on their spending, and then they used a coupon that took twice that amount. 

Wait, let me parse that again. The rewards are $1 off for every $20 spent. So, for every $20, they get $1. So, if they spend $43, how much rewards do they get? 

Let me calculate that. So, $43 divided by $20. Let me see, 20 times 2 is 40, which is less than 43. So, 2 times 20 is 40, and 43 minus 40 is 3. So, 2 times 20 is 40, so 43 is 2 times 20 plus 3. So, that would be 2 times 20 is 40, and 43 minus 40 is 3. So, 2 times 20 is 40, so 43 is 2 times 20 plus 3. So, 2 times 20 is 40, so 43 is 2 times 20 plus 3. So, 43 divided by 20 is 2.15. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So, 2.15 times 20 is 43. So,
