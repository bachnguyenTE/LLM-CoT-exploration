Q: When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Billy and Sally's salaries, and I need to figure out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working for 20 hours, which I think is 20 hours, but maybe that's a typo. Anyway, let's break it down step by step.

First, let me parse the information given.

Billy was hired with a starting salary of $10 per hour. Then, after 2 months, he got a raise of $0.500 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.000 per hour. So, Billy's salary increases in two places: after 2 months and on his first anniversary.

Sally, on the other hand, just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary. So, Sally's starting salary is higher.

We need to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working for 20 hours, which I think is 20 hours, but maybe it's 20 hours? Wait, the problem says "how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?" So, probably, it's 20 hours, but let me confirm.

Wait, the problem says: "If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?" So, both work 20 hours. So, 20 hours is the duration.

So, let's structure this.

First, let's figure out Billy's total earnings.

Billy's starting salary: $10.00 per hour.

After 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour. So, his salary increases to $10.50 per hour.

On his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour. So, his salary increases to $11.50 per hour.

Wait, so Billy's salary increases in two places: after 2 months and on his first anniversary. So, does that mean that his salary increases in two separate periods, or is it a single raise each time?

Wait, the problem says: "After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour. On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.000 per hour." So, it's two raises: one after 2 months, and another on his first anniversary.

So, Billy's salary is:

- $10.00 per hour for the first 2 months.

- Then, after 2 months, he gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new rate is $10.50 per hour.

- Then, on his first anniversary, he gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new rate is $11.50 per hour.

So, Billy's salary is $10.00 for the first 2 months, then $10.50 for the next period, and then $11.50 after his first anniversary.

Wait, but the problem says "On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour." So, does that mean that after his first anniversary, he gets a raise of $1.00 per hour? So, his salary is $10.00 for the first 2 months, $10.50 for the next period, and $11.50 after his first anniversary.

So, if he works for 20 hours, which is 20 hours, how is that split? Is it 2 months worth of time, then the next period, then the first anniversary? Or is it 20 hours in total, with different periods?

Wait, the problem says: "Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour. After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour. On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour. Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was. If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?"

So, the key is that Billy was first hired at $10 per hour, then after 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour, and then on his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00 per hour. So, the total time is 20 hours, but the raises are given at different points in time.

So, we need to figure out how much Billy earned in total over
