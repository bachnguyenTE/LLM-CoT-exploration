Q: Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu.  It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.  He wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week.  How many pounds of butter will he need to make these croissants?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery, and he needs to figure out how much butter he'll need. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Juan wants to make 4 dozen a day for a week. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total butter required for 4 dozen croissants each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Let me write down the given information:

- Butter per dozen: 1/4 pound
- Dozen needed per day: 4
- Number of days: 7 (since it's a week)

So, for one day, he needs 4 dozen croissants. Since each dozen requires 1/4 pound, the butter needed per day would be 4 multiplied by 1/4. Let me calculate that:

4 * (1/4) = 1 pound

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, each day he uses 1 pound of butter. Now, he wants to do this for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total butter needed would be:

1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds

Hmm, that seems too easy. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Starting with 4 dozen croissants a day, each dozen is 1/4 pound. So, 4 * 1/4 is indeed 1. So, 1 pound per day. For 7 days, that's 7 pounds. 

Wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of total croissants for the week and then converting that to butter? Let's see.

If he makes 4 dozen a day, then in a week (7 days), he makes 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants. Each dozen requires 1/4 pound, so total butter is 28 * (1/4). 

Calculating that: 28 * 1/4 = 7 pounds. 

Same result. So, that seems consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how much butter is needed per dozen for the entire week. Since he makes 4 dozen a day, over 7 days, that's 28 dozen. So, 28 * (1/4) = 7 pounds. 

Same answer again. So, seems like 7 pounds is the correct amount of butter he needs.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says he wants to start with making 4 dozen a day for a week. So, is it 4 dozen each day, or 4 dozen in total for the week? The wording says "make 4 dozen a day for a week," which I think means 4 dozen each day, so 4 dozen/day *7 days=28 dozen. So, butter needed is 28 *1/4=7 pounds.

Alternatively, if it was 4 dozen in total for the week, meaning 4 dozen over 7 days, that would be 4/7 dozen per day, which would be different. But the wording is "make 4 dozen a day for a week," which sounds like 4 dozen each day, not 4 dozen in total.

So, yeah, 4 dozen/day *7 days=28 dozen. So, 28 *1/4=7 pounds.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 7 pounds.

**Final Answer**
Juan will need \boxed{7} pounds of butter.

Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu and needs to determine how many pounds of butter he will need. 

Given:
- It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
- He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

First, calculate the butter needed per day:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dollar} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \]

Next, calculate the total butter needed for a week (7 days):
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, Juan will need \boxed{7} pounds of butter.
