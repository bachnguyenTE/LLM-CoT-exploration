Q: Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular price for each blouse is $20.  How much is the total cost of the discounted blouses?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Misha is picking out 4 blouses from a rack that's 30% off. Each blouse normally costs $20. I need to figure out how much the total cost of these 4 blouses will be after the discount. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the discount is 30%, which means Misha is paying 67% of the original price for each blouse because 100% minus 30% is 67%. Wait, no, actually, 100% minus 30% is 67%, but that's the percentage of he's paying. So, to find the discounted price per blouse, I can calculate 67% of $20.

Let me write that down. The original price is $20, and the discount is 30%. So, the discounted price per blouse would be 20 minus 30% of 20. Alternatively, I can calculate 67% of 20. Let me do that.

67% of 20 is the same as 0.67 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that. 0.67 times 20. Hmm, 0.67 times 20. Let me break it down: 0.67 times 20 is the same as 0.67 times 20. So, 0.67 times 20. Let me compute 0.67 times 20.

First, 0.67 times 20. Let me think, 0.67 times 20. Maybe I can compute 0.67 times 20 and then adjust for the extra 0.03. Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can do 20 times 0.67.

Let me do 20 times 0.67. 20 times 0.6 is 12, and 20 times 0.07 is 1.4. So, 12 plus 1.4 is 13.4. So, 20 times 0.67 is 13.4. So, the discounted price per blouse is $13.40.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check that again. 30% of 20 is 6, so 20 minus 6 is 14. So, 30% off would be $14. So, if I'm paying 67%, that should be a bit more than 67% of 20. Wait, 67% is 0.67, so 0.67 times 20 is 13.4. So, that's correct. So, each blouse is $13.40 after the discount.

But wait, 30% off is a significant discount, so 13.40 per blouse seems right. Let me confirm: 30% of 20 is 6, so 20 minus 6 is 14. So, 30% off is $14, which is 14. So, 30% off would be a bit less than that. So, 30% is 6, so 3% is 0.6, so 30% is 6, so 3% is 0.6, so 30% is 6, so 33% is 6.6. So, 30% off is 6, so 33% off is 6.6. So, 20 minus 6.6 is 13.4. So, that's correct. So, each blouse is $13.40 after the discount.

So, if Misha is buying 4 blouses, the total cost would be 4 times 13.40. Let me compute that. 13.40 times 4. Let me do 10 times 4 is 40, 3 times 4 is 12, 0.40 times 4 is 1.60. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 13.40 is 13 dollars and 40 cents. So, 13 times 4 is 52, and 0.40 times 4 is 1.60. So, 52 plus 1.60 is 53.60. So, $53.60.

Wait, let me do it another way. 13.40 times 4.
