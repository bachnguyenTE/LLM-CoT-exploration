Q: Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Dale starts with 100 total candies he ordered. He wants to sell all of them, so he initially has 100. But then, he ends up selling 150. Hmm, so he sold more than he initially had. That must mean he has some candies left over.

Let me write this down:

- Starting amount: 100
- Candies sold: 150

So, to find out how many he has left, I subtract the candies sold from the starting amount. That would be 100 - 150. Wait, 100 minus 150? That doesn't seem right because 150 is more than 100. Maybe I should think about it differently.

Oh, wait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again. It says he started off with 100 total that he ordered, and ended up selling 150. So, he had 100, sold 150. So, 100 - 150 is 50. So, he has 50 left.

But then, he ordered 100 more. So, he adds 100 to his current stock. So, 50 + 100 is 155. So, now he has 155.

But he wants to sell all of his candy. So, how many does he still need to sell? He has 155, so he needs to sell all 155. But wait, he already sold 150, so maybe I need to figure out how many he needs to sell in total.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

He starts with 100. He sells 150. So, he has sold more than he had. So, he has 100 - 150 = -50. That negative number doesn't make sense, so maybe I should think of it as he has 100, sells 150, so he needs to have 150 - 100 = 50 more to reach the number he sold. But he already has 100, so he has 100 - 150 = -50, which again is confusing.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many he needs to sell in total. He wants to sell all of his candy, which is 100. He has already sold 150, but that's more than he had. So, he actually needs to sell 150 - 100 = 50 more. But he already has 100, so he needs to sell 150 - 100 = 50 more. But he already sold 150, so he doesn't need to sell any more. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Hold on, maybe I need to consider the total he has after ordering. So, he starts with 100, sells 150, so he has -50, which is not possible. So, perhaps he needs to have 150 to sell all of his candy. But he only has 100, so he needs to sell 150 - 100 = 50 more. But he already sold 150, so he doesn't need to sell any more. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the question is asking how many more does he need to sell after he has already sold 150. So, he started with 100, sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50, which is not possible. So, he must have 100, sold 150, so he needs to have 150 more to reach 100. But he already has 100, so he needs to sell 150 - 100 = 50 more. But he already sold 150, so he doesn't need to sell any more. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the question is asking how many more does he need to sell in total, not considering the initial 100. So, he has 100, sold 150, so he needs to sell 150 -100=50 more. But he already sold 150, so he doesn't need to sell any more. So, the answer is 0? But that seems odd.

Wait, maybe
