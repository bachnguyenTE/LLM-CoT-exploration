Q: Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than the window. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mark's window is 20 feet high, so that's 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet, and each day it doubles in height. So, every day, the height of the beanstalk becomes twice what it was the day before. I need to find out after how many days the beanstalk will be taller than 20 feet.

Alright, so let's break this down. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet. Each day, it doubles. So, on day 1, it's 4 feet. On day 2, it's 8 feet. Day 3, 16 feet. Day 4, 32 feet. Wait, hold on, 32 feet is more than 20 feet. So, on day 4, the beanstalk is taller than the window. But let me check that again because sometimes when doubling, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, let me list out the days and the corresponding heights to make sure.

Day 0: 4 feet (starting point)
Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
Day 4: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. So, on day 3, it's 32 feet, which is more than 20 feet. So, is the answer 3 days? Because on day 3, it's already taller than the window.

But let me think again. The problem says the beanstalk starts at 4 feet, and each day it doubles. So, day 0 is 4, day 1 is 8, day 2 is 16, day 3 is 32, day 4 is 64. So, on day 3, it's 32 feet, which is more than 20. So, the answer is 3 days.

But wait, let me make sure that the days are counted correctly. The problem says "how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window." So, if on day 3, it's 32 feet, which is taller than 20, then it takes 3 days.

But hold on, sometimes in these problems, the starting day is considered day 0. So, if day 0 is 4 feet, then day 1 is 8, day 2 is 16, day 3 is 32. So, yeah, 3 days.

But let me think about the wording again. It says, "the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall." So, does that mean on day 0, it's 4 feet? Or is day 1 the first day? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but in most cases, when they say "on day 1," it's the first day after the starting point. So, if it starts at day 0, then day 1 is the first day.

But in the problem, it's not clear whether day 0 is included or not. So, perhaps I should consider both cases.

Case 1: Starting day is day 0, so day 0: 4 feet, day 1: 8, day 2:16, day3:32. So, 3 days.

Case2: Starting day is day 1, so day1:4, day2:8, day3:16, day4:32. So, 4 days.

Wait, but the problem says "the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall." So, that would be on day 0, right? So, day 0:4, day1:8, day2:16, day3:32. So, 3 days.

But let me think about the wording again. It says, "the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall." So, that's the initial height, so day 0 is 4 feet. So, the first day, day1, it's 8 feet, which is still less than 20. So, on day3, it's 32, which is more than 20. So, it takes 3 days.

But wait, let me check the problem again. It says,
