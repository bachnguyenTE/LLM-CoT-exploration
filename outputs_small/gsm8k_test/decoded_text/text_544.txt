Q: Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. How much does Jeff get in dollars?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jeff and Brad are trying to split $100 between themselves. Jeff gets four times as much as Brad. Hmm, I need to figure out how much Jeff gets. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me denote the amount Brad gets as a variable. Let's say Brad gets B dollars. Then, since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, Jeff would get 4B dollars. That makes sense because Jeff's share is directly related to Brad's share.

Now, the total amount they have together is $100. So, if I add Brad's share and Jeff's share together, it should equal $100. So, mathematically, that would be:

B (Brad's amount) + 4B (Jeff's amount) = 100

Let me write that down:

B + 4B = 100

Combining like terms, that's 5B = 100.

So, to find the value of B, I can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

5B = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

B = 100 / 5

Calculating that, 100 divided by 5 is 20. So, Brad gets $20.

But the question is asking how much Jeff gets. Since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, I can multiply Brad's amount by 4.

Jeff's amount = 4 * B = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, Jeff gets $80.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Brad gets $20 and Jeff gets $80, then together that's 20 + 80 = 100, which matches the total amount. Also, Jeff's amount is indeed four times Brad's because 80 is four times 20. So, that seems correct.

I think that's the right answer. Jeff gets $80.

**Final Answer**
Jeff gets \boxed{80} dollars.

Let \( B \) be the amount of money Brad gets. Since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have together is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20. Jeff gets four times that amount:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \boxed{80} dollars.
