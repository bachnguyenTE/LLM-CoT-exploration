Q: Every day Charisma meditates for 15 minutes when she first wakes up and again before she goes to sleep.  5 days a week she practices 1 hour of yoga.  in 4 weeks, how much time has she spent on meditation/yoga practice?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes when she wakes up and another 15 minutes before she goes to sleep, totaling 30 minutes per day.

Next, I'll calculate her weekly meditation time by multiplying the daily practice by the number of days she practices each week, which is 5 days. This gives 30 minutes multiplied by 5 days, resulting in 150 minutes of meditation per week.

Then, I'll find out how much time she spends on meditation over 4 weeks by multiplying the weekly practice time by 4 weeks. This results in 150 minutes multiplied by 4 weeks, totaling 60 minutes of meditation over 4 weeks.

Finally, I'll calculate her time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga every day she goes to sleep, which is 60 minutes per day. Over 4 weeks, this amounts to 60 minutes multiplied by 28 days, resulting in 168 minutes of yoga practice.

Adding both the meditation and yoga times together, Charisma spends a total of 168 minutes on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks.
