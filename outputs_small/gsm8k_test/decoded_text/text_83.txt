Q: Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there total? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find out how many thorns there are in total. To do that, I think I should start by figuring out how many roses there are in total, and then multiply that by the number of thorns each rose has. That makes sense because if each rose has 8 thorns, then the total number of thorns would be the total number of roses multiplied by 8.

So, Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. That means the total number of roses is 3 multiplied by 25. Let me write that down: 3 * 25. Hmm, 3 times 25 is 15. So, there are 15 roses in total? Wait, that doesn't seem right. If each rose bush has 25 roses and there are 3 bushes, then 3 * 25 should be 15? Wait, no, 3 * 25 is 15? No, that can't be. 3 * 25 is 15. Wait, 3 times 20 is 60, plus 3 times 5 is 15, so 60 + 15 is 75? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 3 * 25 is 75. Because 25 * 3 is 75. Yeah, that's right. So, 3 rose bushes with 25 roses each would give 75 roses in total.

Okay, so now that I know there are 75 roses, and each rose has 8 thorns. So, to find the total number of thorns, I need to multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose. So, that would be 75 * 8. Hmm, let me calculate that.

75 times 8. Let me break it down. 70 * 8 is 560, and 5 * 8 is 40. So, 560 + 40 is 600. So, 75 * 8 is 600. Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

Wait, let me double-check that. 75 * 8. Another way to think about it is 75 * 8 is the same as (70 + 5) * 8, which is 70*8 + 5*8, which is 560 + 40, which is 600. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Dan has 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, each with 8 thorns. So, total roses are 75, total thorns are 600. So, the answer should be 600.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 75 * 8. Let me do it another way. 8 * 70 is 560, and 8 * 5 is 40, so 560 + 40 is 600. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 75 as 75.0, and multiply by 8. 75.0 * 8. 5 * 8 is 40, 70 * 8 is 560, so 40 + 560 is 600. Yeah, that's consistent.

So, I think I did that right. So, the total number of thorns is 600.

Wait, but let me think again. Each rose has 8 thorns, so each rose contributes 8 thorns. So, 75 roses would have 75 * 8 thorns. So, 75 * 8 is 600. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, each with 8 thorns. So, per rose, it's 8 thorns. So, 25 roses per bush, 8 thorns each, so per bush, it's 25 * 8 = 200 thorns. Then, 3 bushes would have 3 * 220 = 660 thorns. Wait, hold on, that's different. Wait, 25 * 8 is 200? Wait, 25 * 8 is 200, right?
