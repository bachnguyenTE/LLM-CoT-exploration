Q: Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. Calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Adrian, Harriet, and Zack's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Hmm, okay. Then it mentions that Harriet is half the age of Zack. I need to find the average age of the three in three years, and it also tells me that Harriet is currently 21 years old. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's note down what we know:

1. Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
2. Harriet's age = 1/2 × Zack's age
3. Harriet is currently 21 years old.

So, since Harriet is 21, I can use that to find the ages of Adrian and Zack.

Starting with Adrian: If Harriet is 21, then Adrian is three times that. So, 3 × 21. Let me calculate that. 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 1 is 3, so 60 + 3 is 63. So, Adrian is 63 years old.

Next, Zack's age. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, that means Zack is twice as old as Harriet. So, 2 × 21. Let me compute that. 2 times 20 is 40, and 2 times 1 is 2, so 40 + 2 is 42. So, Zack is 42 years old.

Wait, let me just double-check that. If Harriet is half of Zack's age, then Zack is twice as old as Harriet. So, 21 × 2 is 42. Yeah, that seems right.

So, to recap:

- Harriet is 21
- Adrian is 3 × 21 = 63
- Zack is 2 × 21 = 42

Now, the question is asking for the average age of the three in three years. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find each person's age in three years and then compute the average.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we're adding three years to each person's current age, I can just add 3 to each of their current ages to get their ages in three years.

So, let's compute each person's age in three years:

- Harriet's age in three years: 21 + 3 = 24
- Adrian's age in three years: 63 + 3 = 66
- Zack's age in three years: 42 + 3 = 45

Wait, hold on, 63 + 3 is 66? Let me check that. 63 + 3 is 66? Hmm, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 is 63, adding 3 gives 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? No, that's not right. 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 is 63, adding 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? No, that's not correct. 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 is 63, adding 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is 66? Wait, 63 + 3 is
