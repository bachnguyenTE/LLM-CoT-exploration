Q: Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many steps Elliott took during his jog. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Hmm, so that means he walked to school and came back, right? So that's two walks, each contributing half of his total steps. So, half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. So, he did 5,000 steps to school and 5,000 steps back home. That adds up to 10,00 steps for the school walks.

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, that's an additional 1,000 steps. So, so far, he's done 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 steps. Let me add those up. 5,000 + 5,000 is 10,00, and then plus 1,000 is 12,000 steps.

Wait, but the total he's supposed to walk is 10,000 steps a day. So, if he's already done 12,000 steps, that seems like he's already exceeded his goal. But the problem says he only had 2,000 steps left after his jog. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let me read it again. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, and then went for a short jog. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left. So, the total steps he needs to take is 10,000. So, he's done some steps, then he did a jog, and then he has 2,000 left.

So, let me think about it as total steps: 10,000. He did half of his steps on walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then, he did another 1,000 steps for his friend. So, that's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far.

Then, he went for a jog, which we don't know how many steps that was. Let's call that J. After that, he had 2,000 steps left. So, the total steps he did are 5,000 + 1,000 + J, and then he had 2,000 left. So, the total steps he should have done is 10,000.

So, 5,000 + 1,000 + J + 2,000 = 10,000.

Wait, that can't be right because 5,000 + 1,000 is 6,000, plus 2,000 is 8,000. So, 8,000 steps done, but he needs to do 10,000. So, the remaining steps he did during his jog would be 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps. But wait, that's the same as the steps he had left after the jog. Hmm, that seems confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to structure it.

Total steps needed: 10,000.

He did half of his steps on walks to and from school: so that's 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

Then, he did another 1,000 steps for his friend.

Then, he went for a jog, which is J steps.

After that, he had 2,000 steps left.

So, the total steps he did are 5,000 + 1,000 + J, and the remaining steps are 2,000.

So, 5,000 + 1,000 + J + 2,000 = 10,000.

Wait, that's 5,000 + 1,000 is 6,000, plus J is 6,000 + J, plus 2,000 is 8,000 + J. So, 8,000 + J =
