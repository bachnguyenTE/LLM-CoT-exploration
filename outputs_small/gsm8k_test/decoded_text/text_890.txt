Q: There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Smith's garden with 100 plants. Let me try to figure out how many of them are flowering plants. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. So, if there are 100 plants in total, one-fourth of 100 would be the number of indoor plants. Let me calculate that. 

One-fourth of 100 is 100 divided by 4, which is 25. So, there are 25 indoor plants. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem mentions that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Hmm, so after taking out the indoor plants, the rest are either outdoor or flowering. So, first, let me find out how many plants are left after subtracting the indoor ones.

Total plants: 100
Indoor plants: 25
So, remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75.

Okay, so there are 75 plants that are either outdoor or flowering. Now, two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor. Let me compute that.

Two-thirds of 75 is (2/3)*75. Let me calculate that. 75 divided by 3 is approximately 25, but wait, 3 times 25 is 75, so 75 divided by 3 is 25. So, two-thirds of 75 is 25. So, there are 25 outdoor plants.

Wait, hold on, that can't be right. If two-thirds of 75 is 25, then the remaining plants would be 75 - 25 = 50. So, 50 plants are flowering plants. Is that correct?

Let me double-check my calculations. Total plants: 100. One-fourth are indoor, which is 25. Remaining plants: 75. Two-thirds of these are outdoor, so 2/3 * 75 = 50. So, 50 are outdoor, and the rest, which is 75 - 50 = 25, are flowering. So, 25 are flowering plants.

Wait, but 25 is the number of flowering plants. So, the question is asking for the percentage of of the plants that are flowering plants. So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering. So, that's 25%.

Wait, that seems low. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.

Starting over:

Total plants: 100

Indoor plants: 1/4 of 100 = 25

Remaining plants: 100 - 25 = 75

Outdoor plants: 2/3 of 75 = (2/3)*75 = 50

Flowering plants: 75 - 50 = 25

So, 25 are flowering. So, 25/100 = 0.25, which is 25%. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but 25% seems low. Let me think again. If one-fourth are indoor, that's 25, then two-thirds of the remaining 75 are outdoor, which is 50, so 25 are left as flowering. So, yes, 25% is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to verify.

Total plants: 100

Indoor: 25

Outdoor: 2/3 of 75 = 50

Flowering: 100 - 25 - 50 = 25

So, 25% are flowering plants.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions.

One-fourth are indoor, so 1/4 are indoor, so 3/4 are either outdoor or flowering.

Of these 3/4, two-thirds are outdoor, so the remaining one-third are flowering.

So, 3/4 of 100 is 75, as before.

Two-thirds of 75 is 50, so the remaining one-third is 25.

So, 25 are flowering.

So, 25/100 = 25%.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of equations.

Let me denote:

Let I = number of indoor plants

O = number of outdoor plants

F = number of flowering plants

Given that I + O + F = 100

Given that I = 1/4 * 100 =25

So, I =25

Then, O = 2/
