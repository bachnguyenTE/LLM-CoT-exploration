Q: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?

Okay, so I have this relay race problem here. It's a 4 by 4000 meter relay, meaning each team has four members, each running a 400 meter lap. There are two teams: the faster team and the slower team. The question is asking how many seconds the faster team will win by.

Let me break down the information given.

First, the faster team: each of their four members runs their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, each runner takes 55 seconds to complete their part. Since there are four runners, the total time for the relay would be 4 times 55 seconds. Let me calculate that.

4 * 55 = 220 seconds. So, the faster team's total time is 220 seconds.

Now, the slower team: their first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. Then, each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 63 seconds, the third runner takes 63 - 3 = 60 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 66 seconds. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check.

Wait, the first runner is 60 seconds, then each next runner is 3 seconds faster. So, second runner: 60 seconds, third runner: 63 seconds, fourth runner: 66 seconds. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the total time for the slower team is the sum of each runner's time: 60 + 63 +66 +69. Wait, hold on, let me make sure.

Wait, the first runner is 60 seconds, second is 60 - 3 = 57 seconds? Wait, no, the problem says each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. So, first is 60, second is 60 - 3 = 57, third is 57 -3 = 54, fourth is 54 -3 = 51. Wait, that seems way too fast. But the problem says the first runner is 60 seconds, then each subsequent is 3 seconds faster. So, second is 60 -3 = 57, third is 57 -3 = 54, fourth is 54 -3 = 51. So, the total time is 60 +57 +54 +51.

Let me add those up: 60 +57 is 117, 54 +51 is 105, so total is 117 +105 = 222 seconds.

Wait, so the faster team is 220 seconds, the slower team is 222 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds? But that seems too small. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the slower team's times. First runner: 60 seconds, second: 60 -3 = 57, third: 57 -3 = 54, fourth: 54 -3 = 51. So, 60 +57 +54 +51. Let me add them again: 60 +57 is 117, 54 +51 is 55, so 117 +55 is 172. Wait, that's different. Wait, 60 +57 is 117, 54 +51 is 55, so 117 +55 is 172. So, total is 172 seconds.

Wait, so the faster team is 220 seconds, the slower team is 172 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 220 -172 = 48 seconds.

Wait, so the faster team wins by 48 seconds? Hmm, that seems a lot, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, let me make sure I added correctly. First team: 4 runners, each 55 seconds: 4*55=220. Second team: 60,57,54,51. Let me add them step by step:

60 +57 = 117

117 +54 = 171

171 +51 = 172

So, 172 seconds for the slower team. So, 220 -172 = 48 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 48 seconds.

Wait, but let me think again. The first runner is 60, second is 5
