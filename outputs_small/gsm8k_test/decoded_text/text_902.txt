Q: The educational shop is selling notebooks for $1.50 each and a ballpen at $0.5 each.  William bought five notebooks and a ballpen. How much did he spend in all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the notebooks William bought. He purchased five notebooks, each costing $1.50. To find the total cost for the notebooks, I'll multiply the number of notebooks by the price per notebook: 5 multiplied by $1.500 equals $7.50.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.50, so there's no additional cost beyond that.

Finally, I'll add the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together to find the overall amount William spent: $7.50 plus $0.50 equals $8.00.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total amount William spent by calculating the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then adding them together.

1. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Number of notebooks: 5
   - Price per notebook: \$1.50
   - Total cost for notebooks = Number of notebooks × Price per notebook
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 × \$1.50 = \$7.50

2. **Cost of Ballpen:**
   - Number of ballpen: 1
   - Price per ballpen: \$0.50
   - Total cost for ballpen = 1 × \$0.50 = \$0.50

3. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen
   - Total cost = \$7.50 + \$0.50 = \$8.00

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{8.00}
