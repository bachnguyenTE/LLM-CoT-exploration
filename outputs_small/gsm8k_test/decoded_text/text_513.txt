Q: Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes and then 25% of the remaining money on CDs. How much money did Julie have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, and then 25% of what's left on CDs. I need to figure out how much she has left after these two expenses. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what 20% of $500 is. I think percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100, so 20% is 0.20. So, 20% of $500 would be 0.20 multiplied by 500. Let me calculate that. 0.20 times 500. Hmm, 0.2 times 500 is 100, and 0.2 times 50 is 10.10, so adding those together, 180. So, Julie spent $180 on clothes. 

Now, she had $500 initially, and she spent $180 on clothes. So, the remaining money after buying clothes would be 500 minus 180. Let me do that subtraction. 500 minus 180. 500 minus 100 is 440, and then minus 70 more is 370. So, she has $370 left after buying clothes.

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs. So, 25% of $370. Again, converting 25% to a decimal is 0.25. So, 0.25 times 370. Let me compute that. 0.2 times 370 is 74, and 0.05 times 370 is 185.5. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should think of it differently. 25% is a quarter, so a quarter of 370. So, 370 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 370 divided by 4 is 92.5. So, she spends $92.50 on CDs.

Now, subtracting that from the remaining $370. So, 370 minus 92.5. Let me write that out. 370 minus 92.5. Hmm, 370 minus 90 is 280, and then minus 2.5 is 277.5. So, she has $277.50 left after buying the CDs.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with $500. 20% is 0.20, so 0.20*500 is 100, not 180. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. 20% of 500 is 100, not 180. So, that changes things. So, she spent $100 on clothes, not $180. Then, the remaining money is 500 minus 100, which is 400. Then, 25% of 400 is 100. So, she spends another $100 on CDs. So, 400 minus 100 is 300. So, she has $300 left.

Wait, so earlier I thought 20% of 500 is 100, but I thought 20% of 500 is 180. That was my mistake. So, 20% of 500 is 100, not 180. So, that changes the calculations. So, let me correct that.

So, starting with $500. 20% is 100, so she spends $100 on clothes. Remaining money is 500 minus 100, which is 400. Then, 25% of 400 is 100. So, she spends another $100 on CDs. So, 400 minus 100 is 300. So, she has $300 left.

Wait, so that's different from my initial answer. So, I think I made a mistake in the first calculation when I thought 20% of 500 was 180. But actually, 20% of 500 is 100. So, that's where I went wrong. So, the correct
