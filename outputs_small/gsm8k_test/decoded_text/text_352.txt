Q: After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. If she had $36 in the beginning, how much did Andrea save?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Andrea saved some money, then she spent the rest on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. She started with $36. The question is, how much did Andrea save? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Andrea had some money saved up, and then she spent part of it on a sweater and gave her brother some money. The total she had at the beginning was $36. So, she saved some amount, let's call that amount "S," and then she spent $11 on a sweater and $4 on her brother. So, the total amount she spent is $111 + $4, which is $15. 

Wait, hold on, the problem says she spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. So, does that mean she spent $111 and $4, which is $15 in total? So, if she started with $36, and she spent $15, then the amount she saved, S, would be the remaining money after spending $15. 

Let me write that down as an equation. So, the total money she had initially is $36. She spent $15 on the sweater and her brother, so the amount she saved, S, would be 36 minus 15. Let me calculate that: 36 - 15 is 21. So, S is $21. 

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If she saved $21, then she spent $15, so 21 + 15 = 17. But she only had 36. That doesn't add up. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. It says she saved some money, then she spent the rest on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. So, does that mean she spent the rest, which is the amount she saved, on the sweater and her brother? So, if she saved S, then she spent S on the sweater and $4 on her brother. So, the total she spent is S + 4, and that equals the amount she had left after saving, which is S. Wait, that doesn't make sense because S + 4 can't equal S unless 4 is zero, which it's not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to parse the sentence again: "After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4." So, she saved some money, then she spent the rest on the sweater and her brother. So, the rest she had after saving is what she spent. So, if she saved S, then the rest she had was 36 - S. Then, she spent that rest, which is 36 - S, on the $11 sweater and $4 for her brother. So, 36 - S = 11 + 4. So, 36 - S = 15. Therefore, S = 36 -15 = 21. So, Andrea saved $21.

Wait, but earlier I thought that might not make sense because 21 +15 is 36, but that's the total she had. But in this case, she saved 21, spent 15, so 21 +15 is 36, which is her initial amount. So, that makes sense. So, she saved 21, spent 15, and ended up with 36. So, that seems correct.

But let me think again. If she saved S, then she spent the rest, which is 36 - S, on the $11 and $4. So, 36 - S = 15, so S = 36 -15 = 21. So, that's the same result. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but in the first interpretation, I thought that she spent $15, but that was incorrect because the problem says she spent the rest on the sweater and her brother. So, the rest she had after saving was spent on the two items. So, the rest is 36 - S, which is equal to 15. So, 36 - S =15, so S=21. Wait, that's different.

Wait, hold on, maybe I need to clarify the problem. Let me read it again: "After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. If she had $36 in
