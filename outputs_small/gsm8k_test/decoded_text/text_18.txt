Q: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. I need to figure out how many dozens of eggs she'll eat in 4 weeks. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many eggs she uses each day. She makes a 3-egg omelet, right? So, each day, she uses 3 eggs. Got that.

Now, how many days are in 4 weeks? Well, a week has 7 days, so 4 weeks would be 4 times 7. Let me calculate that: 4 * 7 = 28 days. So, Claire eats breakfast for 28 days in 4 weeks.

Each day, she uses 3 eggs, so over 28 days, the total number of eggs she uses is 28 multiplied by 3. Let me do that multiplication: 28 * 3. Hmm, 20 * 3 is 60, and 8 * 3 is 24, so adding those together gives 60 + 24 = 84. So, she uses 84 eggs in total over 4 weeks.

But the question asks for how many dozens of eggs she will eat. I know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. So, to find out how many dozens that is, I need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

So, 84 divided by 12. Let me compute that. 12 goes into 84 how many times? 12 * 7 = 84, right? So, 84 / 12 = 7. That means she eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3 eggs per day, 28 days: 3 * 28. Let me compute 3 * 28. 3 * 20 is 60, and 3 * 8 is 24, so 60 + 24 is 84. Yep, that's correct. Then, 84 divided by 12. 12 * 7 is 84, so that's right. So, 7 dozen eggs.

I think that's it. So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine Daily Egg Consumption:**
   - Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate Total Days in 4 Weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - 4 weeks = 4 * 7 = 28 days.

3. **Compute Total Eggs Consumed:**
   - Total eggs = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

4. **Convert Total Eggs to Dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Number of dozens = 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen.

**Answer:** 7 dozen eggs.
