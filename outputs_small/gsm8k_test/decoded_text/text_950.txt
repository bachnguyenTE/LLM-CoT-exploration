Q: Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make much sense. If they contributed to 45 points, does that mean the total points they scored is 45? Or are they each contributing to the team's 45 points? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?"

Hmm, okay, so Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. So, does that mean the total points they scored is 45? Or is it that each of them contributed to the team's 45 points? Maybe it's the total points they scored is 45. So, the sum of their points is 45. That seems more likely.

So, let me parse this step by step.

First, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. So, the total points they scored is 45. So, Bahati + Azibo + Dinar = 45.

Then, it says Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. So, Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, which is 20 points more. And also, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar. So, that means Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati.

So, let me assign variables to each person's points.

Let me let A be the points scored by Azibo.

Then, since Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, Bahati's points would be A + 20.

Similarly, Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar's points would be (A + 20) - 10, which is A + 10.

So, now, we have:

Azibo: A

Bahati: A + 20

Dinar: A +10

And the total is 45.

So, adding them up:

A + (A +20) + (A +10) = 45

So, let's compute that.

A + A +20 + A +10 = 45

Combine like terms:

3A +30 =45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3A =15

Divide both sides by 3:

A=5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Wait, let me check that.

If Azibo scored 5, then Bahati scored 5 +20=25, and Dinar scored 25 -10=15.

So, 5 +25 +15=45. That adds up.

So, that seems correct.

But wait, the problem says "each contributed to their team's 45 points." So, does that mean each of them contributed to the team's 45 points? Or is it that the total points they scored is 45? I think it's the latter because if each contributed to the team's 45 points, that would mean each of them scored 45 points, which doesn't make sense because then the total would be 135, not 45.

So, I think the first interpretation is correct: the total points they scored is 45.

So, the answer is Azibo scored 5 points.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.

" Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored."

So, "contributed to their team's 45 points." So, each of them contributed to the team's 45 points. So, perhaps each of them scored some points, and the total is 45. So, that's what I thought.

Alternatively, maybe each of them contributed to the team's 45 points, meaning each of them scored 45 points, but that would be 135 points total, which is not 45. So, that can't be.

So, the correct interpretation is that the total points they scored is 45.

So, the equations are:

A + (A +20) + (A +10) =45

Which simplifies to 3A +30
