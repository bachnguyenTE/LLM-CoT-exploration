Q: Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dana's running, walking, and skipping speeds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many miles she can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the information given. It says Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk. So, if I let her walking speed be something, her running speed would be four times that. Then, it also says she can skip at a rate that's half as fast as she can run. So, skipping speed is half of running speed. They also tell me that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. So, maybe I can work backwards from that to find her walking and running speeds.

Let me write down the given information:

1. Running speed is four times walking speed.
2. Skipping speed is half of running speed.
3. Skipping speed is 3 mph.
4. Time spent running is one-third of total time (6 hours), so that's 2 hours.
5. Time spent walking is two-thirds of total time, so that's 4 hours.

So, if I can find her running speed, I can find her walking speed, and then calculate the distance she covers while running and walking, then add them together for the total distance.

Let me denote:

- Let \( w \) be Dana's walking speed in mph.
- Then, her running speed is \( 4w \) mph.
- Her skipping speed is half of running speed, so that's \( \frac{4w}{2} = 2w \) mph.

But we know her skipping speed is 3 mph. So, \( 2w = 3 \). Therefore, \( w = \frac{3}{2} \) mph. So, her walking speed is 1.5 mph.

Then, her running speed is \( 4w = 4 * 1.5 = 6 \) mph.

Okay, so now I know her speeds:

- Walking: 1.5 mph
- Running: 6 mph
- Skipping: 3 mph

Now, she spends one-third of the time running, which is 2 hours, and two-thirds walking, which is 4 hours.

So, the distance she covers while running is speed multiplied by time, which is 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Similarly, the distance she covers while walking is 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Therefore, total distance is 12 + 6 = 8 miles.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, hold on, is the time spent running and walking in hours? Yes, the total time is 6 hours, so one-third is 2 hours, two-thirds is 4 hours. So, that part is correct.

So, running distance: 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Wait, hold on, 6 mph * 2 hours is 12 miles? Wait, 6*2 is 12? Wait, 6*2 is 12, right? So, 12 miles.

Wait, hold on, 6 mph * 2 hours is 12 miles. Then, walking distance: 1.5 mph * 4 hours is 6 miles. So, total distance is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 6 mph * 2 hours is 12 miles. 1.5 mph * 4 hours is 6 miles. So, 12 + 6 is 18 miles. So, total distance is 18 miles.

Wait, but earlier I thought 6 mph * 2 hours is 12, but 6*2 is 12, yes. So, 12 + 6 is 18. So, 18 miles.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the units or anything. The speed is in mph, time is in hours, so miles is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If she runs at 6 mph for 2 hours, that's 6*2=12 miles. Walking at 1.5 mph for 4 hours is 1.5*4=6 miles. So, 12+6=18 miles. So, 18 miles total.

Wait, but let me check if the problem is asking for miles per hour or total miles. It says, "how many miles can she travel in six hours..." So, total distance, which is 18 miles.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, the
