Q: Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many cupcakes Carly made. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the problem says: "Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." Hmm, okay. So, the number of brownies she makes is related to the number of cupcakes. 

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of cupcakes she makes is C. Then, the number of brownies she makes would be three times that number minus 2, right? Because it's 2 less than three times as many. So, mathematically, that would be:

Number of brownies = 3 * C - 2

Got that down. So, if I can find the value of C, I can find out how many cupcakes she made.

Next, the problem says: "If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?" So, each person gets two treats, and there are five people. That means the total number of treats needed is 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

Wait, so the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined is 10. So, the sum of cupcakes and brownies equals 10. So, if I let C be the number of cupcakes and B be the number of brownies, then:

C + B = 10

But we already have an expression for B in terms of C. So, substituting that in, we get:

C + (3C - 2) = 10

Let me write that out:

C + 3C - 2 = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 =10

Now, add 2 to both sides:

4C =12

Then, divide both sides by 4:

C =3

So, that would mean she made 3 cupcakes. Let me double-check that.

If she made 3 cupcakes, then the number of brownies would be 3*3 -2 =9 -2=7 brownies. So, total treats would be 3 +7=10, which matches the requirement. Each person gets two treats, so 5 people *2=10 treats. That seems to add up.

Wait, but let me make sure I interpreted the first part correctly. It says she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, that would be 3C -2, which is correct. So, 3 cupcakes and 7 brownies, totaling 10 treats. That seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by setting up equations differently? Let me see.

Let me denote the number of cupcakes as C and brownies as B. The problem states that B = 3C -2. Also, the total treats are 10, so C + B =10. So, substituting B into the second equation:

C + (3C -2) =10

Which is the same as before, leading to 4C -2=10, so 4C=12, so C=3. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a system of equations:

Equation 1: B =3C -2

Equation 2: C + B =10

Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2:

C + (3C -2) =10

Which is the same as before. So, same answer.

Is there a possibility that I misread the problem? Let me check again.

"Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?"

So, the key points are:

- Cupcakes and brownies are the two treats.

- Number of brownies = 3*(number of cupcakes) -2.

- Total treats =10.

So, yes, the equations are correct.

Wait, another thought: Is the number of brownies 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes? So, 3C -2. So, if she made 3 cupcakes, 3*3=9, minus 2 is 7 brownies. So, 3+7=10, which is correct.

Alternatively, if she made 4 cupcakes, 3*4=12, minus 2 is 10 brownies. So, 4+10=14, which is more than 10. So, that's too many.

If she made 2 cupcakes, 3*2=6, minus 2 is 4 brownies. 2+
