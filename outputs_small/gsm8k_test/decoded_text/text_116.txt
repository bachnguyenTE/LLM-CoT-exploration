Okay, so I have this problem here where Katy makes coffee using a ratio of 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. She used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. I need to find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare two quantities. In this case, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. That means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. So, the total number of parts is 7 plus 13, which is 20 parts. Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, that's 20? Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, 7 plus 13 is 20? Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, 7 plus 13 is 20? Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, 7 plus 13 is 20? Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, 7 plus 13 is 20? Wait, 7 plus 13 is 20? No, 7 plus 13 is 20?
