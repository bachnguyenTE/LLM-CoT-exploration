Q: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.  How many packs of gum will he need to last him 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Each pack has 15 pieces. He wants to know how many packs he'll need to last him 30 days. Wait, hold on, the question says 30 days? That's a typo, right? It should probably be 30 days. Yeah, that makes more sense because 30 is a bit odd. So, moving on.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how many pieces of gum Parker will consume in total over 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces each day, I can multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days. So, 4 pieces/day multiplied by 30 days. Let me write that out:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces.

Wait, hold on, 4 times 30. Hmm, 4 times 30. Let me calculate that again. 4 times 30 is 120. Yeah, that's correct. So, he'll need 120 pieces of gum in total.

Now, each pack has 15 pieces. So, to find out how many packs he needs, I should divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack. So, 120 pieces divided by 15 pieces per pack.

Let me do that division: 120 ÷ 15. Hmm, 15 goes into 120 how many times? Let's see, 15 times 8 is 40, 15 times 8 is 120. Wait, no, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 1220? No, that can't be right. Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? No, that's not right. Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, no, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, no, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, no, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, no, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 120? Wait, 15 times 8 is 1220? Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me do this step by step. 15 times 8: 10 times 8 is 80, and 5 times 8 is 40, so 80 plus 40 is 120. Oh, okay, so 15 times 8 is 120. So, 120 divided by 15 is 8. So, he needs 8 packs of gum.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check that. If each pack is 15 pieces, and he needs 120 pieces, then 120 divided by 15 is indeed 8. So, 8 packs. That seems right.

But wait, let me think again. 15 pieces per pack, 8 packs would be 15*8=120. So, yes, that's correct. So, he needs 8 packs.

But wait, hold on, the original question was about 30 days, not 30. So, 30 days. So, 4 pieces a day, 30 days, 120 pieces. 120 divided by 15 is 8. So, 8 packs.

Wait, but let me think about this another way. If he chews 4 pieces a day, how many days can 1 pack last him? So, 15 pieces divided by 4 pieces per day is 3.75 days. So, each pack lasts about 3 and three-quarters days. So, 30 days divided by 3.75 days per pack is how many packs? Let me calculate that.

30 divided by 3.75. Hmm, 3.75 goes into 30 how many times
