Q: James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?

Okay, let me try to figure out how many toys James needs in total. Hmm, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. That makes sense because each dog needs one toy. So, right now, he has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, initially, he had 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. But wait, no, hold on. The problem says he has 4 toys for 4 dogs, and there are 8 more dogs. So, does that mean he needs 8 more toys? Because each dog needs one, so 8 more toys. So, initially, he has 4 toys, and he needs 8 more, so he needs 12 toys in total? Wait, but then the problem says he went back and saw that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing.

Let me try to parse this again. So, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs 8 more toys. So, he buys 8 toys, bringing his total to 12 toys. Now, when he comes back, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs as when he left. So, initially, he had 4 dogs, and now there are twice as many. So, twice as many dogs as before. So, twice 4 is 8. So, now, he has 8 dogs. But wait, he had 4 dogs initially, and then 8 more, so 12 dogs. But now, he sees that there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so twice 12 is 24. So, now, he has 24 dogs. But he only bought 8 toys, so he can't have 24 dogs. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again.

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?"

So, step by step:

1. James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, 4 toys, 4 dogs.

2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. So, total dogs now: 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

3. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys.

Wait, so when he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, he sees that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. So, twice 12 is 24. So, now, he has 24 dogs.

But he only bought some toys, so he can't have 24 dogs unless he bought 20 more toys. But he only had 4 toys initially, and then bought 8, bringing it to 12. So, he can't have 24 dogs unless he bought 20 more toys. But the problem says he bought some more toys after buying the toys, so maybe he bought 8 more, bringing it to 12, but then he saw that there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so he had to buy more. So, he bought more toys, but how much?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the number of toys he bought in total.

Let me try to outline the steps:

- Initially, 4 toys for 4 dogs.

- Then, 8 more dogs come in, so total dogs become 12.

- He buys toys, but after buying, he sees that there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so he had to buy more toys.

Wait, so when he left, there were 12 dogs. After buying toys, he sees that there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so 24 dogs. So, he had to buy more toys to get from 12 dogs to 24 dogs. So, he needs to buy 12 more toys.

But he already had 4 toys, and bought 8, so he had 12 toys. So, he needs to buy 12 more, bringing his total to 24 toys. But then, when he came back again,
