Q: The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?

Okay, so I have this problem about the marching band ordering new uniforms, and I need to figure out how much each uniform costs in total. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants. I need to find the total cost of each uniform, which means I have to add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. 

Let me list out what each item costs:

1. **Hat:** The problem says the hat costs $25. That seems straightforward.

2. **Jacket:** The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Hmm, okay, so if the hat is $25, then the jacket should be 3 times that. Let me write that down: Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost. So, that would be 3 * $25. Let me calculate that. 3 times 25 is 15, so the jacket costs $75? Wait, no, 3 times 25 is 75? Wait, 25 times 3 is 75? Wait, 25*3 is 75? Wait, 25*2 is 50, so 25*3 is 75? Wait, that seems a bit high, but maybe it is. Let me double-check. 25*3 is 75, yes, that's correct. So the jacket is $75.

3. **Pants:** The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the average of the hat and jacket costs. The hat is $25, the jacket is $75. So, the average would be (25 + 75)/2. Let me compute that. 25 + 75 is 100, and then divided by 2 is 50. So, the pants cost $50.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high for pants, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again. The average of 25 and 75 is indeed 50. So, pants are $50.

So, now I have the costs:

- Hat: $25
- Jacket: $75
- Pants: $50

Wait, hold on, that doesn't add up. Wait, 25 + 75 is 100, divided by 2 is 50. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total cost of the uniform is the sum of these three: hat, jacket, and pants.

So, let me add them up: 25 + 75 + 50. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 25 + 75 is 100. Then, 100 + 50 is 150. So, the total cost is $150.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket."

So, hat is 25, jacket is 3*25=75, pants is (25+75)/2=50. So, total is 25+75+50=150. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but 25, 75, and 50. Let me think about the units. The hat is $25, the jacket is $75, and the pants are $50. So, adding them up, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, no, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, no, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150? Wait, no, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150? Wait, 25 + 75 is 100, plus 50 is 150. Wait, no, 25 + 75
