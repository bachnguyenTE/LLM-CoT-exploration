Q: Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a piece. How much does the remaining cake weigh?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces. Then, Rory and her mom each have a piece. I need to figure out how much the remaining cake weighs. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the cake weighs 20 ounces in total. It's cut into 8 pieces, so each piece must be equal in weight, right? So, if the cake is divided into 8 equal parts, each piece would weigh the same. To find out how much each piece weighs, I can divide the total weight by the number of pieces. That makes sense because if you have a whole thing and you split it into equal parts, each part is a fraction of the whole.

So, let me write that down. The total weight is 20 ounces, and it's divided into 8 pieces. So, each piece would weigh 20 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 8 is... hmm, 8 goes into 20 two times because 8 times 2 is 16, and then there's 4 left over. So, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5 ounces per piece. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 8 times 2 is 16, and 8 times 2.5 is 20. Yeah, that's correct. So each piece is 2.5 ounces.

Now, the cake is cut into 8 pieces, and then Rory and her mom each have one piece. So, that's 2 pieces in total. So, the total weight of the pieces they've eaten is 2 times 2.5 ounces. Let me calculate that. 2 times 2 is 4, and 2 times 0.5 is 1, so 4 plus 1 is 5 ounces. So, together, they've eaten 5 ounces of cake.

The original cake was 20 ounces, so if they've eaten 5 ounces, the remaining cake would be 20 minus 5. Let me do that subtraction. 20 minus 5 is 15. So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, 20 ounces total, divided by 8 pieces is 2.5 ounces each. Two pieces would be 5 ounces. 20 minus 5 is 15. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If the cake is divided into 8 pieces, and two of them are gone, then 8 minus 2 is 6 pieces remaining. So, 6 pieces times 2.5 ounces each. Let me calculate that: 6 times 2 is 12, and 6 times 0.5 is 3, so 12 plus 3 is 15 ounces. Yep, same answer. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as fractions. 20 ounces divided by 8 is 20/8, which simplifies to 5/2 ounces per piece. So, each piece is 2.5 ounces, which is the same as 5/2. So, two pieces would be 2 times 5/2, which is 10/2, which is 5 ounces. So, again, 20 minus 5 is 15 ounces. So, that's the same result.

Wait, another way to think about it: If the cake is divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece is 2.5 ounces. So, the remaining pieces are 8 minus 2, which is 6 pieces. So, 6 times 2.5 is 15 ounces. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the remaining pieces as 8 minus 2, which is 6, and then 6 times 2.5 is 15 ounces. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the remaining cake as 20 minus 5, which is 15. So, that's straightforward.

Wait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the fractions. So, 20 ounces divided by 8 is 2.5 ounces per piece. So, each piece is 2.5 ounces. So, two pieces are 5 ounces. So, 20 minus 5 is 15 ounces. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the remaining cake as 20 minus (2 times 2.5). So, 2 times 2.5 is 5, so 20 minus 5 is 15. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the remaining cake as
