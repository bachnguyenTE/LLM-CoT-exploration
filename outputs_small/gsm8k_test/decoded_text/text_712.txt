Q: Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. How much more candy does Amy have after two weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. The question is asking how much more candy Amy has after two weeks. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how much each of them eats over two weeks. Since a week has 7 days, two weeks would be 14 days. That makes sense. So, I should calculate the total candy each of them consumes in 14 days and then subtract that from their initial amount to see how much they have left.

Let me start with Ginger. She eats 4 pieces each day. So, over 14 days, she would eat 4 multiplied by 14. Let me write that down: 4 * 14. Hmm, 4 times 10 is 4, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 4 + 16 is 20. Wait, no, that's not right. 4 times 10 is 40, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 40 + 16 is 20? Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me do it step by step. 4 times 10 is 40, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 40 + 16 is 56. Wait, that can't be right because 4 times 10 is 40, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 40 + 16 is 56. Yeah, that's correct. So, 4 * 14 is 56. So, Ginger eats 56 pieces in two weeks.

Now, Amy eats 3 pieces a day. So, over 14 days, she would eat 3 multiplied by 14. Let me calculate that. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 4 is 12, so 30 + 12 is 42. So, Amy eats 42 pieces in two weeks.

Now, both started with 100 pieces. So, I need subtract the amount they ate from 100 to find out how much each has left.

For Ginger: 100 - 56. Let me do that. 100 minus 50 is 50, and then minus 6 more is 44. So, Ginger has 44 pieces left.

For Amy: 100 - 42. That's straightforward. 100 minus 40 is 60, and then minus 2 is 58. So, Amy has 58 pieces left.

Now, the question is asking how much more candy Amy has after two weeks. So, I need to find the difference between the amount Amy has and the amount Ginger has.

So, Amy has 58, and Ginger has 44. The difference is 58 - 44. Let me calculate that. 58 minus 40 is 18, and then minus 4 more is 14. So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Ginger eats 4 per day for 14 days: 4*14=56. 100-56=44. Amy eats 3 per day for 14 days: 3*14=42. 100-42=58. Then, 58-44=14. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the difference in their daily consumption. Since Amy eats 3 and Ginger eats 4, the difference in their daily consumption is 1 piece per day. Over two weeks, that's 14 pieces. So, Amy would have 14 more pieces left. That's another way to see it without calculating the total eaten each.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 14 pieces. So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
Amy has \boxed{14} more pieces of candy after two weeks.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, we calculate the total number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total candy each of them
