Q: Two cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?

Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars on a highway. The first car is going at 60 miles per hour, and the second one is going faster, at 70 miles per hour. They pass each other, and then both keep going at their constant speeds. The question is asking how many miles apart they'll be after 2 hours. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that speed is distance over time, so speed = distance / time. But here, we're dealing with two cars moving at different speeds. When they pass each other, they have different starting points, right? So, after passing, each car will continue moving at their own speed. I need to figure out how far each car has traveled in those 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances. That difference will be the separation between them after 2 hours.

Let me write down the given information:

- Speed of first car (V1) = 60 mph
- Speed of second car (V2) = 70 mph
- Time (t) = 2 hours

I need to find the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then subtract the distances to find the separation.

So, distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed × time.

For the first car, distance1 = V1 × t = 60 mph × 2 hours.

Let me calculate that: 60 × 2 = 120 miles. So, the first car has traveled 120 miles in 2 hours.

For the second car, distance2 = V2 × t = 70 mph × 2 hours.

Calculating that: 70 × 2 = 140 miles. So, the second car has traveled 140 miles in 2 hours.

Now, to find how far apart they are after 2 hours, I subtract the distance of the first car from the distance of the second car. That is, separation = distance2 - distance1.

So, separation = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says both cars continue at the same speed after passing. So, after passing, each car is moving at their own constant speed. So, the separation is just the difference in their distances traveled in that time.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. So, relative speed = V2 - V1 = 70 - 60 = 10 mph. That means the second car is gaining on the first car at a rate of 10 miles per hour.

So, in 2 hours, the distance separating them would be relative speed × time = 10 mph × 2 hours = 20 miles. That matches my earlier calculation.

So, both methods give me 20 miles. That seems consistent. So, I think 20 miles is the correct answer.

But just to double-check, let me visualize it. Imagine both cars start at the same point. The first car is slower, so it's ahead. After 2 hours, the first car has moved 120 miles, and the second car has moved 140 miles. The difference is 20 miles, so the second car is 20 miles behind the first car. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of relative motion, from the perspective of the first car, the second car is approaching at 10 mph. So, in 2 hours, it would cover 20 miles. So, from the first car's frame, the second car is 20 miles behind. So, the separation is 20 miles.

Either way, I keep getting 20 miles. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The two cars will separate by \boxed{20} miles after 2 hours.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Both cars continue at their constant speeds after passing each other. We need to find the distance between them after 2 hours.

First, we calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first car: 
  \[
  \text{distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \,00 \text{ miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second car:
  \[
  \text{distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \,00 \,00
