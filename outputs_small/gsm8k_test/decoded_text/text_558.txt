Q: Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. How big is Peter's locker in cubic inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Timothy, Zack, and Peter's lockers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. That seems straightforward. So, Timothy's locker volume is 24 in³. 

Next, it says Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. Hmm, okay. So, if Timothy's locker is 24, then half of that would be Zack's locker. Let me write that down. 

Zack's locker volume = (1/2) * Timothy's locker volume
So, Zack's locker = (1/2) * 24 in³

Let me calculate that. Half of 24 is 12, right? So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches. That makes sense because it's half the size of Timothy's.

Now, moving on to Peter's locker. It says Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. Okay, so Peter's locker is a quarter of Zack's volume. Let me write that down too.

Peter's locker volume = (1/4) * Zack's locker volume
So, Peter's locker = (1/4) * 12 in³

Hmm, let me compute that. A quarter of 12 is... well, 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Timothy is 24, Zack is half of that, which is 12, and Peter is a quarter of Zack's, which is 3. That seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me go through each step again. 

1. Timothy's locker: 24 in³. That's given.
2. Zack's locker: half of 24. Half of 24 is 12. So, 12 in³. That's correct.
3. Peter's locker: 1/4 of Zack's. So, 1/4 of 12. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, 3 in³. 

Yep, that all adds up. So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It's pretty straightforward with fractions. Half and a quarter are simple enough, so multiplying by 1/2 and 1/4 is just dividing by 2 and 4 respectively. 

Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using decimals? Let's see. Half of 24 is 12, which is the same as 12.0. A quarter of 12 is 0.25 * 12, which is 0.25 * 12. 0.25 * 10 is 2.5, and 0.25 * 2 is 0.5, so 2.5 + 0.5 is 3. So, same result. 

Alternatively, using fractions: 1/2 of 24 is 12, and 1/4 of 12 is 3. So, same answer. 

I think that's solid. So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

Wait, just to make sure, let me visualize it. If Timothy's locker is 24, Zack is half, so 12, and Peter is a quarter of that, so 3. So, 24, 12, 3. Each time, it's being halved or quartered. So, 24, 12, 3. That seems like a logical progression. 

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward with simple multiplication and division. So, I think 3 cubic inches is the correct answer for Peter's locker.

**Final Answer**
Peter's locker is \boxed{3} cubic inches.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we calculate Zack's locker volume as follows:

\[
\text{Zack's locker volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker, so we calculate Peter's locker volume as follows:

\[
\text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the volume of Peter's locker is \(\boxed{3}\) cubic inches.
