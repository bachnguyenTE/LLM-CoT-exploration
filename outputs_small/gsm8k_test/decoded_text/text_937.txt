Q: Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Nate feeding his livestock hay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the hay required for each sheep based on that.

Let me break it down. Each goat needs 5 pounds. So, if there are 15 goats, the total hay for goats would be 15 times 5 pounds. Let me write that down: 15 goats * 5 pounds per goat. That should give me the total for the goats.

Now, moving on to the sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, first, I need to find twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that would be 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that. So, 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. Okay, so each sheep needs 7 pounds.

There are 12 sheep, so the total hay for sheep would be 12 * 7 pounds. Let me calculate that. 12 * 7 is 84. So, 84 pounds for the sheep.

Now, to find the total hay needed, I need to add the hay for goats and the hay for sheep together. So, goats are 15 goats * 5 pounds each, which is 25 pounds. Sheep are 12 sheep * 7 pounds each, which is 84 pounds. So, total hay is 25 + 84.

Let me add those together. 25 + 84 is 109. So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is 109 pounds.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds. For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds. Adding them together: 75 + 84. Hmm, 75 + 80 is 155, but since it's 84, that's 11 less. So, 155 -11 is 144? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 75 +84 is 159? Wait, no, 75 +84. 70 +80 is 150, 5 +4 is 9, so 150 +9 is 159. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the multiplication earlier. Let me recalculate.

Goats: 15 goats *5 pounds. 10 goats would be 50 pounds, and 5 goats would be 25 pounds. So, 50 +25 is 75 pounds. That's correct.

Sheep: 12 sheep *7 pounds. 10 sheep would be 70 pounds, and 2 sheep would be 14 pounds. So, 70 +14 is 84 pounds. That's correct.

So, total is 75 +84. Let me add 75 +84. 70 +80 is 150, and 5 +4 is 9, so 150 +9 is 159. So, 159 pounds total.

Wait, so earlier I thought 75 +84 is 159, but I thought I had 144. That was a mistake. So, actually, it's 159 pounds.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought 75 +84 is 159, but I thought I had 144. So, that was a miscalculation. So, the correct total is 159 pounds.

Wait, but let me make sure. 15 goats *5 is 75, 12 sheep *7 is 84, 75 +84 is 159. Yes, that's correct.

So, the total amount of hay is 159 pounds.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should write it out step by step.

First, goats: 15 goats *5 pounds per goat.

15 *5: 10*5=50, 5*5=25, so 50 +25=75. So, 75 pounds for goats.

Sheep: 12 sheep * (2
