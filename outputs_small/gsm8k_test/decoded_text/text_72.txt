Q: Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy raise?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tommy is raising money for his charity by selling brownies and cheesecakes. Each brownie costs $3, and each cheesecake slice costs $4. He sold 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake. I need to figure out how much money he raised in total. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably calculate the total money raised from the brownies and then the total from the cheesecakes separately. After that, I can add both amounts together to get the overall total. That makes sense because each item has its own price, so they should be calculated individually.

Starting with the brownies. Each brownie is $3, and he sold 43 of them. So, to find the total money from brownies, I need to multiply the number of brownies sold by the price per brownie. That would be 43 multiplied by $3. Let me write that down:

Total from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie

Hmm, 43 times 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 40 times 3 is 12, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 129. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 40 times 3 is 120, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 120 + 9 is 129. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total from brownies is $129.

Now, moving on to the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake slice is $4, and he sold 23 slices. So, similar to the brownies, I need to multiply the number of cheesecakes sold by the price per slice. That would be 23 multiplied by $4.

Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice

Let me calculate that. 20 slices times 4 is 80, and 3 slices times 4 is 12. So, 80 + 12 is 92. Therefore, the total from cheesecakes is $92.

Now, to find the total money raised, I need to add the total from brownies and the total from cheesecakes together. So, that would be $129 (from brownies) plus $92 (from cheesecakes).

Total money raised = $129 + $92

Let me add those two amounts. 129 + 92. 9 + 2 is 11, and 20 + 0 is 0, so that's 11 + 0, which is 11. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 129 + 92. Let me write it down:

  129
+  92
------
  221

Wait, 9 + 2 is 11, so I write down 1 and carry over 1. Then, 2 + 9 is 11, plus the carried over 1 is 12. So, that's 221. So, the total is $221.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 129 + 92. 100 + 90 is 190, and 20 + 2 is 22, so 190 + 22 is 212. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me try again.

129 is 100 + 20 + 9, and 92 is 90 + 2. So, adding them together: 100 + 90 is 190, 20 + 0 is 20, and 9 + 2 is 11. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just add the numbers directly.

129
+92
------
Start from the right: 9 + 2 is 11, write down 1, carry over 1.
Next column: 2 + 9 is 11, plus the carried over 1 is 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.
Next column: 1 + 0 is 1, plus the carried over 1 is 2.
So, the total is 221. Yes, that's correct. So, the total money raised is $221.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. So, 43 brownies at $3 each: 43*3. Let me do that again. 4
