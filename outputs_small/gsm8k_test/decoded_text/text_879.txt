Q: At a spa, Iris spent $400 to do her hair, 1/4 as much to do a manicure, and 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure. How much money did she spend at the spa?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Iris spent on do a manicure. The problem states that she spent $400 on her hair, which is 1/4 of the cost of the manicure. To find the total cost of the manicure, I can multiply $400 by 4.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the pedicure. The problem indicates that the pedicure cost is 3/4 of the manicure cost. I'll multiply the manicure cost by 3/4 to find the pedicure cost.

Finally, I'll add up the costs of the hair, manicure, and pedicure to determine the total amount Iris spent at the spa.

Let's determine how much Iris spent at the spa step by step.

1. **Cost of Hair:**
   - Iris spent \$400 on her hair.

2. **Cost of Manicure:**
   - The cost of the manicure is **1/4** of the cost of the hair.
   \[
   \text{Manicure Cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times \$400 = \$100.25
   \]

3. **Cost of Pediure:**
   - The cost of the pediure is **3/4** of the cost of the manicure.
   \[
   \text{Pediure Cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times \$100.25 = \$75.1875
   \]
   - To make it easier, we'll round this to two decimal places:
   \[
   \text{Pediure Cost} \approx \$75.19
   \]

4. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Now, add up the costs of hair, manicure, and pediure.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$400 + \$100.25 + \$75.19 = \$575.44
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$575.44}
\]
