Q: In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?

Okay, so I have this problem about a student council election. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there are 100 voters in total, I can find out how many votes candidate A got by calculating 20% of 100. Hmm, 20% is the same as 0.2 in decimal form, right? So, 0.2 multiplied by 100 should give me the number of votes for candidate A. Let me write that down:

Votes for A = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Okay, so candidate A got 22 votes. Now, candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. Hmm, I need to calculate 55% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes to get candidate B's votes. Let me break that down.

First, find 55% of 22 votes. 55% is the same as 0.55 in decimal. So, 0.55 * 22. Let me compute that. 0.55 times 20 is 11, and 0.55 times 2 is 1.1, so adding those together gives 11 + 1.1 = 12.1. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.

Wait, 55% of 22. Maybe I should do it another way. 10% of 22 is 2.2, so 50% is 11. So, 55% is 11 + 2.2 = 13.2. Oh, okay, so 55% of 22 is 13.2. So, candidate B got 22 + 13.2 = 35.2 votes. Hmm, but that's a decimal. Since we can't have a fraction of a vote, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, actually, the problem doesn't specify that the votes have to be whole numbers. It just says 55% more. So, maybe it's okay to have a decimal. But let me think again. 55% of 22 is 11. So, 22 + 11 is 33. Wait, that's different. Maybe I should do it as 22 + (0.55 * 22). Let me compute 0.55 * 22. 0.5 * 22 is 11, and 0.05 * 22 is 1.1, so 11 + 1.1 is 12.1. So, 22 + 12.1 is 34.1. Hmm, so candidate B got 34.1 votes? That seems odd because you can't have a fraction of a vote in reality, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's acceptable.

Wait, but 55% more than 22 is 22 + 11.1, which is 33.1. Wait, no, 55% of 22 is 11.1, so adding that to 22 gives 33.1. So, candidate B got 33.1 votes. Hmm, but that's still a decimal. Maybe the problem expects us to use exact fractions instead of decimals.

Let me try that. 55% is 11/2 of 110, but wait, no, 55% is 11/2 of 100? Wait, no, 55% of 100 is 55, so 55% of 22 is 11.1. So, 22 + 11.1 is 33.1. So, candidate B got 33.1 votes. Hmm, but that's still a decimal. Maybe the problem expects us to use exact fractions.

Wait, 55% is 11/2, so 55% of 22 is 11/2 of 22, which is 11. So, 22 + 11 is 33. So, candidate B got 33 votes. Wait, but 55% of 22 is 11, so 22 + 11 is 33. So, maybe the problem expects us to use whole numbers, so candidate B got 33 votes.

Wait, but 55% of 22 is
