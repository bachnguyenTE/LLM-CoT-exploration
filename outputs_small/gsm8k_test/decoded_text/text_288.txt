Q: A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a landscaping company delivering flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. The question is asking how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. They want to know how many trucks are needed to carry 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, without exceeding the truck's weight limit of 2000 pounds. So, I think I need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones and then see how many trucks are required to carry that weight.

Let me write down the given information:

- Weight of each flagstone = 75 pounds
- Total weight capacity of a truck = 2000 pounds
- Number of flagstones to be transported in one trip = 80

So, first, I should find the total weight of 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone is 75 pounds, the total weight would be 80 multiplied by 75. Let me calculate that.

80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone. Hmm, 80 times 75. Let me break that down. 80 * 75 is the same as 80 * 75. I can compute this as (80 * 70) + (80 * 5). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, 75 is 70 + 5, but that might complicate things. Maybe it's easier to just multiply 80 by 75 directly.

Alternatively, I can think of 75 as 70 + 5, so 80 * 70 + 80 * 5. Let me compute 80 * 70 first. 80 * 70 is 5600. Then, 80 * 5 is 400. So, adding those together, 5600 + 400 is 6000. Wait, that can't be right because 80 * 75 is 6000? Let me check that again.

Wait, 75 is 70 + 5, so 80 * 70 is 5600, and 80 * 5 is 400, so 5600 + 400 is indeed 6000. So, 80 flagstones weigh 6000 pounds. Hmm, that seems a bit heavy, but okay.

So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds. Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds? I think I need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity.

So, 6000 divided by 2000. Let me compute that. 6000 / 2000 is 3. So, does that mean 3 trucks are needed? Hmm, but wait, 3 trucks can carry 3 * 2000 = 6000 pounds, which is exactly the total weight. So, that seems to make sense.

But hold on, is there a possibility that the weight might not be a whole number? For example, if the total weight was, say, 6001 pounds, then you would need 4 trucks because 3 trucks can only carry 6000, which is less than 6001. But in this case, 6000 is exactly divisible by 2000, so 3 trucks are sufficient.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiplication, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 80 flagstones, each 75 pounds. So, 80 * 75. Let me compute 80 * 75 another way. 75 is 70 + 5, so 80 * 70 is 6000, and 80 * 5 is 400, so 6000 + 400 is 6000. So, 6000 pounds. That seems correct.

Then, 6000 divided by 2000. Let me compute that. 2000 goes into 6000 three times because 2000 * 3 is 6000, and 6000 is less than 6000. Wait, no, 20
