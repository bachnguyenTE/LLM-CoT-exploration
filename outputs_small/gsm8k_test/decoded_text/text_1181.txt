Q: Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Wendy and Colin's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these age problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can manage it.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?"

Alright, so there are two main pieces of information here. The first one is about their current ages, and the second one is about their ages in the future. I need to find Colin's current age.

Let me assign variables to their current ages to make this easier. Let's say:

Let C = Colin's current age.

Then, since Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, I need to express Wendy's current age in terms of Colin's age.

Wait, so seven years from now, Colin's age will be C + 7. Therefore, Wendy's current age is five times that, which would be 5*(C + 7). So, Wendy's current age is 5C + 35.

Let me write that down:

Wendy's current age = 5*(C + 7) = 5C + 35.

Okay, that seems right. So Wendy is 5C + 35 years old now.

Now, the second piece of information is about their ages in the future. It says, "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."

So, in 25 years, Colin's age will be C + 25. And that will be equal to a third of Wendy's current age.

Wait, so that means:

C + 25 = (1/3)*Wendy's current age.

But we already have Wendy's current age in terms of C, which is 5C + 35. So, substituting that in:

C + 25 = (1/3)*(5C + 35).

Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation with just C, which is Colin's current age. That should be solvable.

Let me write that equation again:

C + 25 = (1/3)*(5C +35).

To make it easier, maybe I can eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3.

So, 3*(C +25) = 5C +35.

Let me compute the left side:

3C +75 = 5C +35.

Now, let's get all the C terms on one side and constants on the other.

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C +35.

Then, subtract 35 from both sides:

75 -35 = 2C.

Which is 40 = 2C.

Divide both sides by 2:

C = 20.

Wait, that can't be right. Colin is 20 years old now? Let me check my steps to see if I made a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

1. Let C = Colin's current age.

2. Wendy's current age is five times Colin's age in 7 years: 5*(C +7) = 5C +35. That seems correct.

3. In 25 years, Colin's age will be C +25, which is equal to a third of Wendy's current age. So, C +25 = (1/3)*(5C +35). That seems right.

4. Multiply both sides by 3: 3C +75 =5C +35.

5. Subtract 3C: 75 =2C +35.

6. Subtract 35: 40=2C.

7. Divide by 2: C=20.

Hmm, so according to my calculations, Colin is 20 years old now. Let me verify this.

If Colin is 20 now, then in 7 years, he'll be 27. Wendy is five times that, so 5*27=35. So Wendy is 35 now.

In 25 years, Colin will be 20 +25=45. Is 45 equal to a third of Wendy's current age? Wendy is 35 now, a third of that is 35/3 ≈11.6666... which is not 45. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, so that means my answer is wrong. There must be a mistake in my setup.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.

The problem says: "Wendy
