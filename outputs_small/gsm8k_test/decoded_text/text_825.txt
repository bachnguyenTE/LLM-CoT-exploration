Q: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.  There is a total of 341 cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.  How many cards does Becca have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Becca, Smendrick, and PJ collecting Magic Cards. The total number of cards they have together is 341. Hmm, wait, 341? That seems like a typo because 341 is a three-digit number, but the total is probably supposed to be 341? Or maybe it's 341? Let me check the original problem again. It says, "There is a total of 341 cards." Hmm, maybe it's 341? Or is it 341? Wait, no, 341 is 341? No, wait, 341 is 341. Maybe it's 341. I think it's 341, but let me make sure. The problem says, "There is a total of 341 cards." So, yeah, 341. Okay, so total cards: 341.

Alright, so the problem states: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards. There is a total of 341 cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. How many cards does Becca have?

So, let me break this down. We have three people: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ. Their total number of Magic Cards is 341. We need to find out how many cards Becca has.

Let me assign variables to each person's number of cards to make it easier. Let's say:

Let P = number of cards PJ has.

Then, Smendrick has 3 times that, so S = 3P.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so B = S + 12.

So, in terms of P, that would be B = 3P + 12.

So, now, the total number of cards is the sum of all three: P + S + B = 341.

Substituting the expressions in terms of P:

P + 3P + (3P +12) = 341.

Let me write that out:

P + 3P + 3P +12 = 341.

Combine like terms:

P + 3P is 4P, plus another 3P is 7P, plus 12 is 7P + 2.

So, 7P + 2 = 341.

Now, subtract 2 from both sides:

7P = 341 - 2 = 339.

So, 7P = 339.

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for P:

P = 339 / 7.

Hmm, let me compute that. 7 goes into 339 how many times?

7*48= 56, which is too big. Wait, 7*48 is 56, but 339 is less than that. Wait, 7*48 is 56, but 7*48 is 56, which is way too big. Wait, 7*48 is 56, but 339 is 300 something. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 7*48 is 336, right? Because 7*40=280, 7*8=56, so 280+56=336. So, 7*48=336.

So, 339 - 336 is 3. So, 339 divided by 7 is 48 with a remainder of 3. So, 339/7=48.428571...

Wait, that can't be right because the number of cards should be a whole number. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Let me go back and check.

Total cards: 341.

Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards: S = 3P.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick: B = S +12 = 3P +12.

So, total cards: P + S + B = P + 3P + (3P +12) = 7P +12.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 7P +2, but it's actually 7P +12.

So, 7P +12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7P = 341
