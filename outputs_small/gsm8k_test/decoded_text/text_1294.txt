Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Jake spends at the store. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the store has a "buy one get one 50% off" deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Each T-shirt originally costs $8. Then, he buys a pair of shoes that's 40 off the original price, and the shoes originally cost $40. I need to calculate the total amount he spends.

Alright, let's tackle the T-shirts first. The deal is buy one, get one 50% off. So, if he buys two, he gets one at full price and the other at 50% off. Let me calculate the cost for each T-shirt.

The original price is $8. If he gets one at full price, that's $8. The second one is 50% off, so I need to find 50% of $8 and subtract that from $8.

Calculating 50% of $8: 0.55 * 8 = $4.40. So, the discounted price is $8 - $4.40 = $3.60.

So, each T-shirt costs $8 and $3.60. Since he bought two, the total for the T-shirts is $8 + $3.60 = $11.60.

Wait, let me double-check that. 50% of 8 is 0.55*8, which is 4.40. So, 8 - 4.40 is indeed 3.60. So, yes, that's correct. So, two T-shirts cost $11.60 in total.

Now, moving on to the shoes. The original price is $40, and there's a 40% discount. So, I need to find 40% of $40 and subtract that from $40.

Calculating 40% of 40: 0.40 * 40 = $16. So, the discounted price is $40 - $16 = $24.

So, the shoes cost $24 after the discount.

Now, to find the total amount Jake spends, I need to add the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.

So, $11.60 (T-shirts) + $24.00 (shoes) = $25.60.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

For the T-shirts: 50% off on two items. So, each T-shirt is $8. If he buys two, one is full price, one is 50% off.

So, 50% of $8 is $4. So, the cheaper one is $4. So, total for T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.00.

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, the problem says "buy one get one 50% off." So, if he buys two, he pays full price for one and half price for the other. So, that would be $8 + (0.5 * $8) = $8 + $4 = $12.00.

But earlier, I thought 50% off on two items, so each is 50% off, so each is $4, so total is $8. But that's not correct because the 50% is on the second item, not on the first.

Wait, maybe I got confused. Let me clarify.

The deal is "buy one get one 50% off." So, if he buys two, he pays full price for one and 50% off for the other. So, the first T-shirt is $8, the second is 50% off, which is $4. So, total is $12.00.

But wait, 50% off is on the second T-shirt, so the second one is 50% off, which is $4, so total is $8 + $4 = $12.00.

But in my initial calculation, I thought of 50% off on each, which would be $4.40, but that's incorrect because the 50% is only on the second item.

So, which is correct? Let me think.

If the deal is "buy one get one 50% off," that means for every two items, you pay full price for one and 50% off for the other. So, the first item is full price, the second is half price.

So, for two T-shirts, the total
