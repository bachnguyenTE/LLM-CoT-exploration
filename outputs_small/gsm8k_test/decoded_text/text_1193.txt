Q: Jason was told he could earn $3.00 for doing his laundry,  $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.  In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once.  How much money did Jason earn?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jason and his weekly earnings from doing his laundry, cleaning his room, taking trash to the curb, and emptying the dishwasher. The question is asking how much money Jason earned in a two-week period. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem. It says that each week, Jason can earn different amounts depending on what he does. Specifically, he gets $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking trash to the curb, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher. So, each week, he can earn money for each of these activities.

Now, the problem gives me the number of times he did each activity over a two-week period. It says he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice, and cleaned his room once. So, I need to calculate how much he earned each week for each activity and then add them up for two weeks.

Let me break it down week by week. Since he did each activity once or twice, I can calculate his earnings for each week and then double them for two weeks.

Starting with the first week: he did his laundry once. So, that's $3.00. Then, he took the trash out twice, so that's 2 times $0.75. Next, he cleaned his room once, which is $1.50. And he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, which is 6 times $0.50.

Wait, hold on, actually, the problem says it's a two-week period, so I think I need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then add them together. So, let me structure it.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first week:

1. Laundry: $3.00
2. Taking trash: 2 times $0.75
3. Cleaning room: $1.50
4. Emptying dishwasher: 6 times $0.50

Then, do the same for the second week, but since he did each activity once or twice, it's the same as the first week. So, the earnings for the second week would be the same as the first week.

Therefore, I can calculate the total earnings by calculating the weekly earnings and then multiplying by two.

Let me compute the weekly earnings first.

Week 1:

Laundry: $3.00

Taking trash: 2 * $0.75 = $1.50

Cleaning room: $1.50

Emptying dishwasher: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00

So, adding these up: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00

Let me add them step by step:

$3.00 + $1.50 = $4.500

$4.50 + $1.50 = $6.00

$6.00 + $3.00 = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the first week.

Since it's a two-week period, he would earn the same amount again in the second week.

Therefore, total earnings = $9.00 (week 1) + $9.00 (week 2) = $18.00

Wait, hold on, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, in the first week, he did laundry once, which is $3.00, took trash twice, which is 2 * $0.75 = $1.50, cleaned his room once, which is $1.50, and emptied the dishwasher 6 times, which is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

So, adding them up: 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 3.

Wait, 3 + 1.5 is 4.5, plus 1.5 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So, yes, $9.00 per week.

So, over two weeks, it's 9 * 2 = $18.00.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was $9.00 per week, so two weeks would be $18.00. But in the problem statement, the options are not given, but the user just wrote the question and the answer is to be filled in. Wait, no, the user just wrote the question and the answer is to be filled in, but in the initial prompt, the user wrote:
