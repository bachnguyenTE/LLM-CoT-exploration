Q: Steve put together a puzzle that took 10 hours of hard work to complete. Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. How long did it take Anna to finish the difficult puzzle?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Steve and Anna working on a puzzle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Steve took 10 hours to put together the puzzle. That part is straightforward. So, Steve's time is 10 hours. 

Now, the next part is about Anna. It says Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. Hmm, okay, so I need to break this down. 

Let me write down what I know:

- Steve's time (S) = 10 hours
- Anna's time (A) = ?

The problem says Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, first, I need to find half of Steve's time, and then add 2 hours to that.

So, half of Steve's time would be (1/2) * S. Since S is 10 hours, that would be (1/2) * 10. Let me calculate that. Half of 10 is 5. So, half of Steve's time is 5 hours.

Now, Anna took 2 hours more than that. So, I need to add 2 hours to 5 hours. That would be 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Wait, so does that mean Anna took 7 hours? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, Steve took 10 hours. Half of that is 5. Then, 2 more hours would be 7. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Maybe I can set up an equation.

Let me denote Anna's time as A. The problem says A is 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, in equation form, that would be:

A = (1/2) * S + 2

We know S is 10, so plugging that in:

A = (1/2)*10 + 2
A = 5 + 2
A = 7

Yep, that's the same result. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the wording again. It says Anna took 2 hours more than half Steve's time. So, is it half of Steve's time plus 2, or is it half of (Steve's time plus 2)? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read it again: "Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time." So, it's 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, it's (1/2)*S + 2, which is 5 + 2 =7. So, that's correct.

If it had said "half of (Steve's time plus 2)", it would be different, but the way it's phrased, it's 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, yeah, 7 hours.

So, I think the answer is 7 hours.

But just to make sure, let me think about the units. Steve took 10 hours, Anna took 7 hours. That seems reasonable because 7 is less than 10, which makes sense since Anna took less time than Steve.

Wait, but actually, no. Wait, hold on. If Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, and half of Steve's time is 5, then Anna took 7. So, 7 is less than 10, which is correct because Anna is faster. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if it had been half of (Steve's time plus 2), that would be different. Let me see: half of (10 + 2) is 6, so Anna would have taken 6 hours. But that's not what the problem says. The problem says 2 hours more than half Steve's time, so it's 5 + 2 =7.

So, yeah, 7 is the correct answer.

I think I've thought it through enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

**Final Answer**
The time it took Anna to finish the puzzle is \boxed{7} hours.

Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. 

First, we calculate half of Steve's time:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we add 2 hours to this result to find Anna's time:
\[
5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time it took Anna to finish
