Q: In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. I need to figure out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in seven days. That means if I know how much Brian walks, Sofie walks double that amount. But Sofie's daily walking distance is given as 10 miles. So, I guess I need to find out how much Brian walks each day and then multiply that by seven days.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the relationship correctly. It says Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. So, if I let Brian's total walking distance in seven days be B miles, then Sofie's total walking distance would be 2B miles. That makes sense because twice as much.

But Sofie's daily walking distance is 10 miles. So, over seven days, Sofie walks 10 miles each day, so her total distance is 10 * 7. Let me calculate that: 10 * 7 is 70 miles. So, Sofie walks 70 miles in seven days.

Since Sofie walks twice as much as Brian, that means Brian walks half of what Sofie does. So, Brian's total distance is half of 70 miles. Let me compute that: 70 / 2 is 35. So, Brian walks 35 miles in seven days.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Brian walks 35 miles in seven days, then Sofie walks twice that, which is 70 miles. And 70 miles is indeed twice 35 miles. So, that seems to add up.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a ratio problem. The ratio of Sofie's distance to Brian's distance is 2:1. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, then Brian walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles. Yep, that's the same answer.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by setting up an equation. Let me denote Brian's daily walking distance as B_d and Sofie's daily walking distance as S_d. We know that S_d is 10 miles, and Sofie walks twice as much as Brian each day. So, S_d = 2 * B_d.

Plugging in the known value, 10 = 2 * B_d. Solving for B_d, we get B_d = 10 / 2 = 5 miles per day. So, Brian walks 5 miles each day. Then, over seven days, Brian walks 5 * 7 = 35 miles. That's consistent with what I found earlier.

Wait, so both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. It seems like 35 miles is the correct answer.

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, let me go through each step again.

1. Sofie's daily distance: 10 miles.
2. Sofie's total distance in 7 days: 10 * 7 = 70 miles.
3. Since Sofie walks twice as much as Brian, Brian's total distance is half of 70, which is 35 miles.
4. Alternatively, since the ratio is 2:1, Brian's daily distance is 10 / 2 = 5 miles.
5. Brian's total distance in 7 days: 5 * 7 = 35 miles.

All these methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that 35 miles is the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was understanding the relationship between their daily walking distances and then applying that to the total over seven days. It's important to remember that "twice as far" means the total distance, not the daily distance. So, if Sofie walks twice as much as Brian in total, not per day, the ratio applies to the total distances.

Another way to think about it is to consider the ratio of their daily distances. If Sofie walks twice as much as Brian each day, then their daily distances are in the ratio 2:1. So, if I let Brian's daily distance be x, then Sofie's is 2x. Since Sofie's daily distance is 10, 2x = 10, so x = 5. Therefore, Brian walks 5 miles each day, and over seven days, that's 35 miles.

Yes, that's another way to look at it, and it still gives the same answer. So, I think I'm solid on this one.

I guess the key takeaway here is to always pay attention
