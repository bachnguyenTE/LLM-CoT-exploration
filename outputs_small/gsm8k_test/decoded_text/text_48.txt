Q: Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tracy has a piece of wire that's 4 feet long, and she's using it to support tomato plants in her garden. The wire is being cut into smaller pieces, each 6 inches long. The question is asking how many pieces she obtained. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if the wire is 4 feet long, I can convert that to inches to make it easier to work with the 6-inch pieces. Let me do that calculation. 4 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot would be 4 * 12. Let me compute that: 4 times 10 is 40, and 4 times 2 is 8, so 40 + 8 is 52. Wait, no, that's not right. 4 times 12 is actually 48 inches. Because 12 inches make a foot, so 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Okay, that makes sense.

So, Tracy has a wire that's 48 inches long. She's cutting it into pieces that are each 6 inches long. So, to find out how many 6-inch pieces she can get from 48 inches, I need to divide the total length by the length of each piece. That is, 48 divided by 6. Let me do that division: 48 ÷ 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 48 how many times? Well, 6 times 8 is 48, so that would be 8 pieces. So, she would have 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each piece is 6 inches, and she has 8 pieces, then 8 times 6 inches should equal the total length. 8 * 6 is 48 inches, which is 4 feet. That matches the original length of the wire. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think about it in feet. Since each piece is 6 inches, and 6 inches is half a foot, right? Because 12 inches is a foot, so 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So, if the wire is 4 feet long, and each piece is 0.5 feet, then the number of pieces would be 4 divided by 0.5. Let me compute that: 4 ÷ 0.5. Hmm, dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, so 4 * 2 is 8. So, that also gives me 8 pieces. That's consistent with the inches calculation.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 8 pieces. Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was converting the total length from feet to inches because the pieces were given in inches. Once I had the total length in inches, I could just divide by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces. Alternatively, converting the length of each piece to feet and then dividing the total length by that gives the same result. Both approaches worked out, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.

Another way to think about it is using unit conversion factors. The wire is 4 feet long, and each piece is 6 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So, the number of pieces is 4 feet divided by 0.5 feet per piece, which is 8. Yep, that's the same as before.

I guess another way to visualize it is to imagine the wire as a straight line 48 inches long. If you cut it every 6 inches, how many cuts would you make? Well, the first cut would be at 6 inches, the second at 12 inches, and so on. Each cut creates a new piece. So, starting from 0 inches, the first cut is at 6, second at 12, third at 18, fourth at 24, fifth at 30, sixth at 36, seventh at 42, and the last piece would be from 42 to 48 inches, which is 6 inches. So, that's 8 pieces. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a number line from 0 to 48 inches, each piece is 6 inches. So, how many 6-inch segments fit into 48 inches? It's 48 divided by 6, which is 8. So, that's another way to see it.

I think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and all of them
