Q: Judy teaches 5 dance classes, every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday.  If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Judy makes in one week. Let me break this down step by step. First, let me understand the problem.

Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day. These are on the weekdays, which are Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. On Saturday, she also teaches, but the problem doesn't specify how many classes she has on Saturday. Hmm, wait, let me check the original question again. It says she teaches 5 dance classes every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday. Oh, okay, so on weekdays, it's 5 classes each day, and on Saturday, it's 8 classes. So, in total, how many classes does she teach in a week?

Let me calculate that. From Monday to Friday, that's 5 days, each with 5 classes. So, 5 days multiplied by 5 classes per day. That would be 5 * 5 = 25 classes on weekdays. Then, on Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, total classes in a week would be 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure. The problem says she teaches 5 dance classes every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday. So, that's 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday. So, yes, that's 5*5 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

Each class has 15 students. So, each class has 15 students. So, the total number of students she teaches in a week would be 33 classes multiplied by 15 students per class. Let me compute that: 33 * 15. Hmm, 30*10 is 330, and 33*5 is 165, so 330 + 165 = 495 students. So, Judy teaches 495 students in a week.

She charges $15.00 per student. So, the total money she makes in a week would be 495 students multiplied by $15.00 per student. Let me calculate that. 495 * 15 is 2475, and 495 * 0.00 is 0, so total is $2475.00. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 33 classes *15 students is 495 students. 495 *15. Let me do it another way. 495 *10 is 4950, and 495*5 is 2475, so 4950 +2475 is 7425. Wait, that's different. Wait, no, 495*15 is 7425. Wait, so why did I get 495*15 as 4950 +2475? Wait, no, 495*15 is 495*(10+5) = 4950 +2475 = 7425. So, that's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought 33*15 is 495, but 33*15 is 495, but 33*15 is 495? Wait, 33*15 is 495, yes, because 30*15 is 450, and 3*15 is 45, so 450 +45=495. So, 33*15 is 495. So, 495 students, each charged $15.00, so 495*15.00.

Wait, so 495*15 is 7425, and 495*0.00 is 24.75. So, adding those together, 7425 +24.75 is 7449.75. So, $7,449.75 per week.

Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. 33 classes, each with 15 students, so 33*15=165 students per day? Wait, no, 33 classes in a week, each with 15 students, so 33*15=165 students per day? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 33 classes in a week, each with 15 students, so
