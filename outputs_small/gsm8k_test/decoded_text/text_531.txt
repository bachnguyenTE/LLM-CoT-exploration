Q: 48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?

Okay, so I have this problem here about passengers getting on and off a bus. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 48 people on the bus initially. That seems straightforward. Then, on the first stop, 8 passengers get off. Hmm, okay, so I need to subtract those 8 from the total. Let me write that down.

After the first stop:
Number of passengers = 48 - 8 = 40.

Alright, so now there are 40 passengers left on the bus. Now, the next part says that 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Wait, so 5 times 8? Let me calculate that.

5 * 8 = 40.

So, 40 people get on the bus. I need to add that to the current number of passengers.

After the first stop:
Number of passengers = 40 + 40 = 80.

Wait, that seems like a lot. So, after the first stop, there are 80 passengers on the bus. Hmm, okay, that makes sense because 5 times as many people get on as those who got off, which is 40, so 40 added on top of 40.

Moving on to the second stop. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, I need to subtract 21 from the current number of passengers.

After the second stop before any new passengers get on:
Number of passengers = 80 - 21 = 59.

Okay, so now there are 59 passengers on the bus. Then, the problem says that 3 times fewer passengers get on. Hmm, "3 times fewer" is a bit confusing. Let me think about that.

If 3 times fewer means that the number of people getting on is 3 times less than the number who got off? Or is it 3 times fewer than the number who got off? Wait, no, it's 3 times fewer passengers get on. So, if 3 times fewer means that the number getting on is 3 times less than the number who got off. So, if 21 got off, then 3 times fewer would be 21 / 3 = 7.

Wait, that might not be the right interpretation. Let me check. "3 times fewer" can sometimes be tricky. It could mean that the number getting on is 3 times less than the number who got off, which would be 21 / 3 = 7. Alternatively, it could mean that the number getting on is 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which is 21 - 3*21 = negative, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the first interpretation is correct.

So, 3 times fewer means 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.

So, adding 7 passengers to the current number.

After the second stop:
Number of passengers = 59 + 7 = 66.

Wait, so after the second stop, there are 66 passengers on the bus. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Start: 48
First stop: 8 get off, 40 get on. So, 48 - 8 = 40, then 40 + 40 = 80.
Second stop: 21 get off, so 80 - 21 = 59. Then, 3 times fewer than 21 get on, which is 7. So, 59 + 7 = 66.

Wait, 66? That seems a bit low, but let me check each step again.

First stop: 48 - 8 = 40. Then, 5 times 8 is 40, so 40 + 40 = 80. That seems right.

Second stop: 80 - 21 = 59. Then, 3 times fewer than 21 is 7, so 59 + 7 = 66. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but 3 times fewer is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. If 3 times fewer means that the number getting on is 3 times less than the number who got off. So, if 21 got off, then 3 times fewer would be 21 - (3*21) = negative, which doesn't make sense. So, that interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's 3 times fewer than the number who got off, meaning 21 - (3*21) = 21 - 6 = 5. But that doesn't make much sense either. Wait,
