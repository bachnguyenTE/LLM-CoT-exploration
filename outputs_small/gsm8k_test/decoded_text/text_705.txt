Q: Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run 15 feet/second, how many feet can her turtle crawl in 40 seconds?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. The cat can run 15 feet per second, and I need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem mentions that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. That means the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed. So, if I can find the turtle's speed, I can then calculate how far it goes in 40 seconds.

The cat's speed is given as 15 feet per second. Since the cat is 5 times faster, I can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5. Let me write that down:

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5

Calculating that, 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. To do that, I should use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

I know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, and the time is 40 seconds. Plugging those numbers into the formula:

Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds

Multiplying 3 by 40, let's see, 3 times 40 is 120. So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cat is 5 times faster, so 15 divided by 5 is indeed 3. Then, 3 times 40 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any errors here. The key was understanding that the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's, so dividing the cat's speed by 5 gives the turtle's speed. Then, using the basic distance formula, multiplying speed by time gives the distance. Everything checks out.

So, I think the answer is 120 feet. That should be the number of feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

The turtle's speed is 3 feet per second. Over 40 seconds, it can crawl:

Distance = 3 ft/s × 40 s = 120 feet.

**Answer:** The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
