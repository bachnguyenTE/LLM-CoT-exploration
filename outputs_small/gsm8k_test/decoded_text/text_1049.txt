Q: There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a library with 50 books. Let me try to figure out how many Spanish books there are. Hmm, let's see. The problem says half of them are written in English, and 10% are in German. The rest are Spanish. I need to find out how many Spanish books there are.

Alright, first, let me break down the information. There are 50 books in total. Half of them are in English. So, half of 50 is... let me calculate that. Half of 50 is 25. So, 25 books are in English. That seems straightforward.

Next, it says 10% of the books are in German. Okay, so I need to find 10% of 50. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the number. So, 10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form. So, 0.10 multiplied by 50. Let me do that calculation.

0.10 * 50. Hmm, 0.1 times 50 is 5.5, right? Because 0.1 is 10%, so 10% of 50 is 5.5. Wait, but 10% is 0.1, so 0.1 times 50 is 5.5. So, 10% of 50 is 5.5. Hmm, but wait, can you have half a book? That doesn't make sense. So, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, 10% of 50 is 5.5? That can't be right because you can't have half a book. Maybe I should double-check my math. 10% of 50 is 5.5? Let me think. 10% is the same as 1/10, so 50 divided by 10 is 5. So, 10% of 50 is 5. So, 10% is 5, not 5.5. Wait, so I think I messed up the decimal point. 10% is 0.1, so 0.1 times 50 is 5. So, 10% of 50 is 5. So, 10% of 50 is 5, not 5.5. So, I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

So, 10% of 50 is 5. So, 10% of 50 is 5. So, that's 5 German books. Okay, that makes more sense because you can't have half a book. So, 5 German books.

So, now, we have 25 English books and 5 German books. The rest are Spanish. So, to find the number of Spanish books, I need to subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

So, total books are 50. Subtract 25 English and 5 German. So, 50 - 25 - 5. Let me compute that. 50 minus 25 is 25, and 25 minus 5 is 20. So, 20 Spanish books.

Wait, let me just make sure I did that right. So, 25 English, 5 German, 20 Spanish. 25 plus 5 is 30, plus 20 is 50. Yeah, that adds up. So, that seems correct.

But just to double-check, let me go through the steps again. Total books: 50. Half are English, so 25. 10% are German. 10% of 50 is 5.5, but that's not possible, so 10% is 5. So, 25 English, 5 German, 20 Spanish. 25 plus 5 is 30, plus 20 is 50. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 10% of 50 is 5.5, but since you can't have half a book, maybe the problem is expecting us to use exact numbers, even if it's a decimal. So, maybe 10% is 5.5, so 25 English, 5.5 German, and then 50 minus 25 minus 5.5 is 24.5. But that's not a whole number either. Hmm, so maybe the problem is expecting us to use exact percentages, even if it results
