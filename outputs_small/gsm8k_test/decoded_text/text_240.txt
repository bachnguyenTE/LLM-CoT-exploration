Q: James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about James, Robert, and John's candies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says:

"James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?"

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many candies Robert has because both James and John are related to him. The problem gives me information about John, so maybe I can start with that.

It says John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if I let R represent the number of candies Robert has, then John has 2R candies. But wait, the problem also tells me that John has 54 candies. So I can set up an equation:

2R = 54

To find R, I just need to divide both sides by 2. Let me do that:

R = 54 / 2
R = 27

So Robert has 27 candies. That makes sense because twice 27 is 54, which matches the information given.

Now, the problem also says that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Since Robert has 27, James must have 27 + 6. Let me calculate that:

James = R + 6
James = 27 + 6
James = 33

So James has 33 candies. Now, the question is asking how many more candies John has than James. John has 54, and James has 33. So I need to subtract James's candies from John's to find the difference.

Difference = John - James
Difference = 54 - 33

Wait, 54 minus 33. Let me do that subtraction. 54 minus 30 is 24, and then minus 3 more is 21. So 54 - 33 is 21? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.

Wait, 54 minus 33. 5 minus 3 is 2, and 4 minus 3 is 1, so 21. So the difference is 21? Wait, 21 is 21, but that seems a bit off because 54 - 33 is 21? Wait, no, 54 minus 33 is 21? Wait, no, 54 minus 33 is 21? Wait, 54 minus 30 is 24, so 54 minus 33 is 21? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm messing up the subtraction. Let me write it down:

54
-33
----
21

Yes, that's right. 54 minus 33 is 21. So John has 21 more candies than James.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes I make mistakes in subtraction.

So, John has 54, James has 33. 54 minus 33. Let's count: 33 plus 21 is 54. Yes, that's correct. So the difference is 21, which is 21 candies.

Wait, but 21 is written as 21? No, 21 is twenty-one. Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one? Wait, no, 21 is twenty-two. Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one. Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one. Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one. Wait, no, 21 is twenty-one. Wait, no, 2
