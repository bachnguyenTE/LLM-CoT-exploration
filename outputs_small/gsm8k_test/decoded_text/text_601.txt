Okay, so Steve is a video game enthusiast who loves playing. His parents gave him a console and 5 games for his birthday. Let me try to figure out how many games he has after 3 years. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the timeline. He has 3 years to consider: the first year, the second year, and the third year. Each year has different numbers of games he buys and receives.

Starting with the first year: He saves enough to buy 1 game per month for a year. So, in the first year, he buys 1 game each month. There are 12 months in a year, so that would be 12 games. But wait, he also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, in the first year, he buys 12 games and receives 5, making it 17 games at the end of the first year.

Moving on to the second year: He starts buying 2 games a month. Again, 12 months, so that's 24 games. Plus, he gets 5 games for Christmas. So, in the second year, he buys 24 games and receives 5, totaling 29 games by the end of the second year.

Now, the third year: He increases his buying rate to 4 games a month. So, 4 games multiplied by 12 months is 48 games. Plus, he gets 5 games for Christmas. So, in the third year, he buys 48 games and receives 5, totaling 53 games by the end of the third year.

Wait, let me double-check that. First year: 12 + 5 = 17. Second year: 24 + 5 = 29. Third year: 48 + 5 = 53. Hmm, that seems right.

But hold on, does he start buying 2 games a month in the second year? So, does that mean he buys 2 games each month for 12 months? No, wait, 2 games a month for 12 months would be 4 games, but he's buying 2 games each month for 12 months? Wait, no, 2 games a month for 12 months is 4 games, but 2 games a month for 12 months is 4 games. Wait, no, 2 games a month for 12 months is 4 games. Wait, no, 2 games a month for 12 months is 24 games. Wait, 2 times 12 is 24. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, no, 2 games a month for 12 months is 24 games. So, yeah, 24 games in the second year. So, 24 + 5 is 29. Then, in the third year, 4 games a month for 12 months is 48 games, plus 5 is 53. So, total games after 3 years is 53.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the Christmas games are only given once a year, or does he get 5 games every year, including the first year? The problem says he gets 5 games for Christmas every year. So, each year, he gets 5 games, regardless of when he buys them.

So, in the first year, he buys 12 games and gets 5, so 17. Second year, buys 24 and gets 5, so 29. Third year, buys 48 and gets 5, so 53. So, 53 games in total after 3 years.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says he starts buying 1 game per month for a year, then 2 games a month the following year, and 4 games a month in the third year. So, each year, the number of games he buys increases.

But does he get the 5 games for Christmas every year, so each year, he gets 5 more games, regardless of when he buys them. So, in the first year, he buys 12 and gets 5, so 17. Second year, buys 24 and gets 5, so 29. Third year, buys 48 and gets 5, so 53.

Wait, but hold on, is the 5 games for Christmas only given once a year, or does he get 5 games each year, meaning 5 per year, so 5 times 3 years is 15? But that would be different.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Steve loves playing video games. His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday. He
