Q: On average Joe throws 25 punches per minute.  A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes.  How many punches did he throw?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total duration of the fight. Since each round lasts 3 minutes and there are 5 rounds, the total duration is 5 multiplied by 3, which equals 15 minutes.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of punches Joe throws by multiplying his punching rate by the total fight duration. Joe throws 25 punches per minute, so over 15 rounds, he throws 25 punches per minute multiplied by 15 minutes, resulting in 125 punches.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total duration of the fight:**
   
   - Each round lasts **3 minutes**.
   - There are **5 rounds** in the fight.
   
   \[
   \text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of punches:**
   
   - Joe throws **25 punches** per minute.
   
   \[
   \text{Total punches} = 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ punches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{125}
\]
