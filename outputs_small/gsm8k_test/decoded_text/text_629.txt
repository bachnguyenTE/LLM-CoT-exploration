Q: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much James made from selling those used cars. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, he sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. Hmm, that's a lot of money. Let me write that down. Each car is $25,000. So, 10 cars would be 10 times that amount. Let me calculate that: 25,000 multiplied by 10. Hmm, 25,00 times 10 is 250,000. So, he made $250,00 from selling the cars. 

But wait, the company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. So, the company took 30% of $25,000 for each car. Let me figure out how much that is per car. 30% of 25,000. To calculate that, I can multiply 25,000 by 03. So, 25,000 times 0.3. Let me do that: 25,000 times 0.3 is 7,500. So, the company paid James $7,500 per car. 

Since he sold 10 cars, the total amount the company paid him is 10 times 7,500. Let me calculate that: 7,500 times 10 is 75,000. So, the company paid him $75,000 in total. 

Now, to find out his profit, I need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue. His total revenue was $250,000, and his total cost was $75,000. So, 250,000 minus 75,000 is... let me subtract: 250,000 minus 75,000. That's 175,000. So, his profit is $175,000. 

But wait, the question says he got a 10% commission on the profits. So, he gets 10% of that $175,000. Let me calculate that: 10% of 175,000 is 17,500. So, he gets $7,500 as a commission. 

To find out how much he made in total, I need to add his profit and the commission. So, $175,000 plus $7,500 is $182,500. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, total revenue: 10 cars at $25,000 each is 10 * 25,000 = 250,000. That seems right. 

Total cost: 30% of 25,000 per car is 0.3 * 25,000 = 7,500 per car. For 10 cars, that's 10 * 7,500 = 75,000. That also seems correct. 

Profit: 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000. Then, 10% commission on 175,000 is 0.1 * 175,000 = 17,500. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 7,500, but now I'm getting 17,500. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no, let me see. 10 cars, each 25,000. So, total revenue is 250,000. Company paid 30% of that price per car, so 0.3 * 25,000 = 7,500 per car. 10 cars, so 75,000. So, total cost is 75,000. 

Profit is 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000. Then, 10% commission on that profit is 0.1 * 175,000 = 17,500. So, that's correct. 

So, total amount he made is profit plus commission: 175,000 + 17,5
