Q: Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?

Okay, so I have this problem about how high Naruto can lift a mountain compared to other people. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can. Hmm, okay. So if I let the height that Kagiyami can lift a mountain be some number, then Naruto's height would be ten times that. But I don't know what that number is yet. Maybe I can find it by relating it to another person.

Next, it says that Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay can. So if I let the height that Saskay can lift a mountain be another number, then Kagiyami's height would be four times that. So far, I have three people: Naruto, Kagiyami, and Saskay, each related to the next.

Then, it mentions that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. So if I let the height that Pompei can lift a mountain be another number, then Saskay's height is twelve times that. And the problem tells me that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. So that's the starting point.

Let me try to write this out as equations to make it clearer.

Let me denote the heights as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the height Pompei can lift a mountain.
- Let \( S \) be the height Saskay can lift a mountain.
- Let \( K \) be the height Kagiyami can lift a mountain.
- Let \( N \) be the height Naruto can lift a mountain.

From the problem:
1. \( N = 10 \times K \) (Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami)
2. \( K =4 \times S \) (Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay)
3. \( S =12 \times P \) (Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei)
4. \( P =1 \) inch (given)

So, starting from Pompei, which is 1 inch, I can find out how high Saskay can lift, then go up to Kagiyami, and finally to Naruto.

Let me compute each step:

First, \( P =1 \) inch.

Then, \( S =12 \times P =12 \times1 =12 \) inches.

Next, \( K =4 \times S =4 \times12 =48 \) inches.

Finally, \( N =10 \times K =10 \times48 =480 \) inches.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high. But the question asks for the height in feet. I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so I need to convert inches to feet.

To convert inches to feet, I can divide the total inches by 12.

So, \( 480 \div12 =40 \) feet.

Wait, let me double-check that division. 12 times 40 is 480, yes, that's correct.

So, the final answer is 400 feet? Wait, no, 480 divided by 12 is 40. So, 40 feet.

Wait, hold on, 12 times 40 is 480, yes, that's correct. So, 480 inches is 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting from Pompei: 1 inch.

Saskay: 12 times higher, so 12 inches.

Kagiyami: 4 times higher than Saskay, so 48 inches.

Naruto: 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so 480 inches.

Convert inches to feet: 480 /12 =40 feet.

Yes, that seems right. So, the answer is 40 feet.

**Final Answer**
The mountain can be lifted by Naruto is \boxed{40} feet.

Given the problem, we need to determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet. The relationships between the heights are as follows:

1. \( N = 10 \times K \) (Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami)
2. \( K = 4 \times S \) (Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay)
3. \( S = 12 \times P \) (Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei)
4. \( P = 1 \) inch (P Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch)

Starting from Pompei
