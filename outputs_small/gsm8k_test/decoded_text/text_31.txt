Q: Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half the first one. A third says 25% more than the first one. What is their average guess?

Okay, so I have this problem where Gunter is trying to count jelly beans in a jar, and he's asking his friends for their guesses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says one friend says 80 jelly beans. That's straightforward. Then, another friend says 20 more than half the first one. Hmm, okay, so half of 80 is... let me calculate that. Half of 80 is 40, right? So if the first friend said 80, then the second friend is saying 20 more than that. So 40 plus 20 is 62. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Half of 80 is 40, plus 20 is 62. Yeah, that seems correct.

Then, the third friend says 25% more than the first one. So, 25% of 80 is... let me compute that. 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal, so 80 times 0.25. Let me do that multiplication. 80 times 0.25. Hmm, 80 times 0.2 is 16.8, and 80 times 0.05 is 40. So adding those together, 16.8 plus 40 is 56.8. So 25% of 80 is 56.8. Therefore, the third friend is saying 80 plus 56.8, which is 136.8. Wait, that seems like a lot more than the others. Is that possible? Maybe, but let me make sure I did that right. 25% of 80 is indeed 20.5, right? Because 10% of 80 is 8, so 20% is 16, and 5% is 4. So 16 plus 4 is 20. So 25% is 20.5. So 80 plus 20.5 is 100.5. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 25% of 80 is 20.5, so 80 plus 20.5 is 100.5. So the third friend is saying 100.5. That's a big jump from the first two friends. So, the three friends are saying 80, 62, and 100.5. 

Now, the question is asking for their average guess. So, to find the average, I need to add up all their guesses and then divide by the number of friends. How many friends are there? The problem says one says 80, another says 20 more than half the first one, and a third says 25% more than the first one. So that's three friends in total.

So, let's add up the three numbers: 80, 62, and 100.5. Let me write that down: 80 + 62 + 100.5. Let me compute that step by step. 80 plus 62 is 142. Then, 142 plus 100.5 is 242.5. So the total sum is 242.5.

Now, to find the average, I need to divide this total by the number of friends, which is 3. So, 242.5 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 242.5 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 24 eight times (since 3 times 8 is 24), with no remainder. Then, bring down the 2, 3 goes into 2 zero times, so we write a decimal point and bring down a 5, making it 25. 3 goes into 25 eight times (3 times 8 is 24), with a remainder of 1. Bring down another 0, making it 10. 3 goes into 10 three times (3 times 3 is 9), with a remainder of 1. So, putting it all together, 242.5 divided by 3 is 80.8333... So, approximately 80.8333.

But wait, let me check that division again because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can convert 242.5 into a fraction over 3. 242.5 is the same as 2425/
