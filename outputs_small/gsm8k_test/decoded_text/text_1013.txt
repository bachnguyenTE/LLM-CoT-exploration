Okay, so Janet is a waitress, and she makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a downpayment. She works 40 hours a week. I need to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to save that down payment.

First, let me break down the problem. The car costs $10,000. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo. I think it's supposed to be $10,000? Or maybe $10,000? Hmm, no, probably a typo. Let me assume it's $10,000. So, the total cost is $10,000.

She wants to save 20% of that. So, first, I need to calculate 20% of $10,000. To find 20% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.22. So, 10,000 * 0.22. Let me compute that.

10,000 * 0.22. Hmm, 10,000 * 0.2 is 2,400, and 10,000 * 0.02 is 220. So, adding those together, 2,400 + 220 is 2,660. So, she needs to save $2,660.

Now, her earnings come from both wages and tips. She makes $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. So, her total earnings per hour are 10 + 15, which is $25 per hour.

She works 40 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings are 25 * 40. Let me calculate that. 25 * 40 is 1,000. So, she makes $1,000 each week.

She needs to save $2,660. So, how many weeks does she need to work to save that? I can divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings.

So, 2,660 divided by 1,000. Let me compute that. 2,660 / 1,000 is 2.66. So, approximately 2.66 weeks.

But she can't work a fraction of a week, so she needs to work full weeks. So, 2.66 weeks would mean she needs to work for 3 weeks to have enough money saved.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 20% of $10,000 is 0.2 * 10,000 = 2,000. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did earlier. Wait, 20% of 10,000 is 2,000? Wait, 10,000 * 0.2 is 2,000. But earlier, I thought it was 2,660. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The car is $10,000, and she wants to save 20% of that. So, 20% of 10,000 is 2,000. So, she needs to save $2,000.

Wait, so earlier, I thought it was 20%, but maybe it's 20%. So, 20% of 10,000 is 2,660, but 20% is 2,000. So, which one is correct? The problem says 20%. So, 20% of 10,000 is 2,000.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment." So, 20% of 10,000 is 2,000. So, that's correct.

So, she needs to save $2,000.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought 20% of 10,000 is 2,660, but that was a mistake. 10,000 * 0.2 is 2,000. So, that was incorrect.

So, let me correct that. So,
