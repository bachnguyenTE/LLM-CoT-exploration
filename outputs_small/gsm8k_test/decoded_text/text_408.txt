Q: Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that Toby is reading a book that's 45 pages long. Each page averages 200 words. So, I should probably start by calculating the total number of words in the book. That makes sense because his reading speed is given in words per minute, so knowing the total words will help me figure out how long it'll take him to read the entire book.

So, if each page is 200 words and there are 45 pages, I can multiply 200 by 45. Let me write that out:

Total words = 200 words/page * 45 pages

Hmm, 200 times 45. Let me calculate that. 200 times 40 is 9,600, and 200 times 5 is 1,000. Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I should break it down differently. 200 * 45 is the same as 220 * 45, but that might not help. Alternatively, 200 * 45 is the same as 200 * (40 + 3) = 200*40 + 200*3. 200*40 is 8,000 and 200*3 is 600. So, adding those together, 8,000 + 600 is 8,600. So, the total number of words is 8,600.

Okay, so he's reading 8,600 words. Now, his reading speed is 300 words per minute. So, to find out how long it'll take him to read the entire book, I can divide the total number of words by his reading rate.

Time = Total words / Reading rate

So, Time = 8,600 words / 300 words per minute.

Let me compute that. 8,600 divided by 300. Hmm, 300 goes into 8,600 how many times? Well, 300 times 20 is 6,000. Subtract that from 8,600, and we have 2,600 left. 300 goes into 2,600 eight times because 300*8 is 2,400. Subtract that, and we have 200 left. 300 goes into 200 less than once, so that's 0.666... minutes. So, altogether, that's 20 + 8 + 0.666... minutes, which is 28.666... minutes.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify the division. Let me write it as 8,600 / 300. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 100, so that becomes 86 / 3. 86 divided by 3 is 28 with a remainder of 2, so that's 28 and 2/3 minutes, which is approximately 28.666... minutes. So, about 28.67 minutes.

But wait, that seems really fast. Let me double-check my calculations. 300 times 28 is 8,664, right? Because 300*28 is 8,400, and 300*28 is 8,664. Wait, 300*28 is 300*20=6,600 and 330*8=2,640, so 6,600 + 2,640 is 9,240? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 300*28 is 2,400, so 300*28 is 2,400*10, which is 24,000. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should do 300*28. 300*20 is 6,600, and 300*8 is 2,400. So, 6,600 + 2,400 is 9,000. So, 300*28 is 9,000. But the total words are 8,600, so 9,0
