Q: Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies. Each lollipop costs $0.40, and the candies cost $3.20 in total. The question is asking how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost him. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Manolo already bought some items, and now we need to find out the cost for buying more of the same items. So, it's like scaling up the quantities. Instead of five lollipops and four candies, we need to find the cost for ten of each. That makes sense.

Let me break it down. I know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. So, if he buys ten lollipops, I can calculate that by multiplying the cost of one by ten. Similarly, for the candies, I know the total cost for four is $3.20, so I can find the cost of one candy by dividing that by four, and then multiply by ten for ten candies.

Wait, let me write that down to make it clearer.

First, calculate the cost of ten lollipops:
Each lollipop is $0.40, so ten lollipops would be 10 * $0.40.

Let me compute that. 10 times 0.40. Hmm, 10 times 0 is 10, and 10 times 0.40 is 0.40. So, adding them together, 10 + 0.40 is $1.40. So, ten lollipops cost $1.40.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the candies. The total cost for four candies is $3.20. So, to find the cost of one candy, I need to divide $3.20 by 4.

Let me do that division. 3.20 divided by 4. Hmm, 4 goes into 3 zero times, so we look at 32. 4 goes into 32 eight times. So, 8. Then, bring down the 0. 4 goes into 0 zero times, so we have 0. So, one candy is $0.80.

Wait, let me check that. 4 times 0.80 is 3.20. Yes, that's correct. So, each candy is $0.80.

Now, if one candy is $0.80, then ten candies would be 10 * $0.80. Let me compute that. 10 times 0.80 is $8.00.

So, ten lollipops cost $1.40, and ten candies cost $8.00. To find the total cost, I need to add these two amounts together.

Adding $1.40 and $8.00. Let me do that. 1.40 + 8.00. The dollars add up to 1 + 8 = 9, and the cents add up to 40 + 00 = 40. So, that's $9.40.

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

Ten lollipops: 10 * 0.40. 10 * 0.40 is indeed 4.00, which is $1.40. That seems correct.

Four candies: 4 * 0.80 is 3.20. So, that's correct as well.

Adding $1.40 and $8.00: 1.40 + 8.00. 1 + 8 is 9, and 0.40 + 0.00 is 0.40. So, total is $9.40. That seems right.

Wait, but let me think again. If each lollipop is $0.40, then ten lollipops would be 10 * 0.40. 0.40 is the same as 2/5, so 10 * 2/5 is 2. So, 2 dollars. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, hold on, 0.40 is 40 cents, which is 0.40. So, 10 * 0.40 is 1.40, which is 1 dollar and 40 cents. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 0.40 is 40 cents, so 10 lollipops would be 40 cents,
