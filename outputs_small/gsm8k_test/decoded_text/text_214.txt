Q: Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?

Okay, so I have this problem about Jerry's two pools with leaks. Both pools are emptying out at 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. I need to figure out how much water the small pool has now. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me try to visualize the situation. There are two pools: a big one and a small one. Both are leaking, so they're losing water over time. The leak rate is 4 gallons per minute for each pool. So, every minute, each pool loses 4 gallons. That means the amount of water in each pool decreases by 4 gallons each minute.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, which I think means that four minutes have passed since that time. So, the current time is four minutes after the initial state. At that point, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. I need to find the current amount of water in the small pool.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S gallons. Then, according to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so the big pool has 4S gallons.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, four minutes ago, the small pool had S - 4 gallons, and the big pool had 2*(S - 4) gallons. Wait, hold on, is that correct? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, that means at that time, the big pool was 2*(small pool's water). So, if I let the current amount be S, then four minutes ago, the small pool was S - 4, and the big pool was 2*(S - 4). But wait, that might not be right because the pools are losing water over time.

Wait, maybe I need to model the situation with equations. Let me define variables for the amount of water in each pool at the current time. Let me denote:

Let S = current amount of water in the small pool (gallons)
Then, the big pool has 4S gallons now.

Four minutes ago, the small pool had S - 4 gallons, and the big pool had 2*(S -4) gallons. But wait, that might not be correct because the pools are losing water over time. So, four minutes ago, the small pool had less water, and the big pool had less water as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the amount of water in each pool as a function of time. Let me think.

Let me denote t as the time in minutes since the current time. So, now, t = 0. Four minutes ago, t = -4.

The leak rate is 4 gallons per minute for each pool, so the amount of water in each pool at time t is:

For the small pool: S(t) = S + 4t (since it's losing water, so it's increasing in negative direction)
Wait, no. Wait, if the pool is leaking, the amount of water is decreasing over time. So, the amount of water at time t is S(t) = S - 4t, where S is the current amount.

Similarly, the big pool: B(t) = 4S -4t.

Wait, hold on, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, if the small pool now has S gallons, and it's leaking at 4 gallons per minute, then four minutes ago, it had S + 4*4 = S + 16 gallons. Similarly, the big pool now has 4S gallons, so four minutes ago, it had 4S + 4*4 = 4S +16 gallons.

But according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, at that time, the big pool had twice the small pool's water.

So, four minutes ago, the small pool had S +16 gallons, and the big pool had 4S +16 gallons. So, according to the problem, 4S +16 = 2*(S +16). Is that correct?

Wait, let me write that down:

Four minutes ago, the small pool had S +16 gallons, and the big pool had 4S +16 gallons.

But according to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4S +
