**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of apples:**
   
   - Number of boxes = 2
   - Apples per box = 40
   
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of packs:**
   
   - Apples per pack = 8
   
   \[
   \text{Number of packs} = \frac{88}{8} = 11
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
