Q: 90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?

Okay, so I have this problem here about contacts and boxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that 90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days. Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off. If he buys 2 boxes of contacts, how much will each pair of contacts cost?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. 

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The question is asking for the cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes. So, I need to figure out the total cost for 2 boxes after the discount and then divide that by the number of pairs.

Wait, but before that, let me make sure I understand the quantities involved. Each box has 90 contacts, right? So, if he buys 2 boxes, that's 2 times 90 contacts. Let me calculate that.

2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts.

So, 180 contacts in total. But the question is about the cost per pair. Hmm, wait, does each box contain 90 single use contacts, or is it 90 pairs? The wording says "90 single use contacts come in 1 box." So, it's 90 single use contacts per box. So, each box is 90 contacts.

So, 2 boxes would be 180 contacts. So, each pair would be 180 divided by 2, which is 90. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the question is about the cost per pair of contacts. So, if each box has 90 contacts, then two boxes have 180 contacts. So, how many pairs is that? Each pair is two contacts, so 180 divided by 2 is 90 pairs. So, 90 pairs of contacts.

But wait, the question is asking for the cost per pair. So, if he buys 2 boxes, each box is $100.00 with 10% off. So, first, I need to calculate the discounted price per box, then multiply by 2, and then divide by the number of pairs.

Let me write this down step by step.

1. Original price per box: $100.000
2. Discount: 10%, so the discount amount is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.000.
3. So, the discounted price per box is $100.000 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box.
4. If he buys 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.
5. Now, how many pairs of contacts is that? Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 180 contacts. Each pair is 2 contacts, so 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.
6. Therefore, the cost per pair is $180.00 / 90 pairs.

Wait, let me compute that. $180 divided by 90. Hmm, 90 goes into 180 twice. So, 180 divided by 90 is 2/1.0, which is 2. So, 180 divided by 90 is 2. So, each pair costs $2.00.

Wait, that seems too low. Let me check my steps again.

Original price per box: $100.000, 10% off, so $90.00 per box. 2 boxes: $180.00. Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 180 contacts. Each pair is 2 contacts, so 180 / 2 = 90 pairs. So, 180 / 90 = 2. So, each pair is $2.00.

Wait, but 90 contacts per box, so 2 boxes is 180 contacts, which is 90 pairs. So, 180 divided by 90 is 2. So, yeah, each pair is $2.00.

But that seems a bit low, but maybe it's correct. Let me think about it another way.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the cost per contact, but no, it says per pair. So, each pair is two contacts, so 180 divided by 2 is 90 pairs, each pair costing $2.00.

Wait, but
