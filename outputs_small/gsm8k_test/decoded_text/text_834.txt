Q: Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mason's bike journey. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says Mason is traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He goes on a bike journey for 4 hours, then takes some rest, and then continues for another 6 hours. The question is asking how many miles he has traveled in total.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then add them together. Since he's moving at a constant speed, I can use the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. That formula is pretty straightforward, right?

Let me write that down. The formula is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for the first part of his journey, he's traveling for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour. Let me plug in those numbers.

First part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \,0 \text{ hours} \]

Wait, hold on, 4 hours. So, 8 multiplied by 4. Let me do that multiplication. 8 times 4 is 32. So, he covers 32 miles in the first part.

Okay, that seems right. Now, he takes some rest, so that's just a break, not moving. So, the distance during rest is zero. But since the question is about total miles traveled, I don't need to consider the rest time. It's just a period when he's not moving, so no distance is added there.

So, moving on to the second part. He goes on another 6 hours. Again, he's moving at 8 miles per hour. So, let's calculate that.

Second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 6 \, \text{hours} \]

Calculating that, 8 multiplied by 6 is 48. So, he covers 48 miles in the second part.

Now, to find the total distance he has traveled, I need to add both parts together. So, 32 miles plus 48 miles.

Total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 + 48 \]

Adding those together, 32 plus 48 is 80. So, 80 miles in total.

Wait, let me double-check that. 8 miles per hour for 4 hours is 32 miles, and 8 miles per hour for 6 hours is 48 miles. Wait, hold on, 8 times 6 is 48, not 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? No, that's not right. 8 times 6 is 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? No, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, no, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, no, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, no, 8 times 6 is 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, no, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, 8 times 6 is 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, 8 times 6 is 48? Wait, 8 times 6 is 48. Wait, 8 times 6 is 48.
