Q: Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20 books, how many more books does Clara have than Alice?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20 books, how many more books does Clara have than Alice? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me try to understand what the problem is saying. There are three people involved: Alice, Steven, and Clara. Each of them has a certain number of books. The problem gives me some relationships between their numbers of books and asks a specific question about the difference between Clara and Alice.

Let me break it down. The first sentence says, "Alice has 6 more books than Steven." So, if I let S represent the number of books Steven has, then Alice has S + 6 books. That makes sense because if Steven has S books, adding 6 more would give Alice's total.

Next, the problem says, "Clara has two times as many books as Steven." So, if Steven has S books, then Clara has 2*S books. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem also tells me that Clara has 20 books. So, Clara's number of books is 20. Since Clara's books are equal to 2*S, I can set up an equation: 2*S = 20. Wait, hold on, 2*S equals 20? That seems a bit confusing because 20 is a number, not a variable. Maybe I should write it as 2*S = 20. Yeah, that's better.

So, if 2*S = 20, then to find S, I can divide both sides by 2. That would give me S = 20 / 2, which is 10. So, Steven has 10 books. Let me write that down: Steven has 10 books.

Now, since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, and Steven has 10, Alice must have 10 + 6 = 16 books. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If Steven has 10, adding 6 gives 16. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, now I know how many books each person has: Steven has 10, Clara has 20, and Alice has 16. The question is asking, "How many more books does Clara have than Alice?" So, I need to find the difference between Clara's books and Alice's books.

That would be Clara's books minus Alice's books. So, 20 - 16. Let me calculate that. 20 minus 16 is 4. So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Let S be the number of books Steven has.
2. Alice has S + 6 books.
3. Clara has 2*S books.
4. Clara has 20 books, so 2*S = 20.
5. Solving for S: S = 20 / 2 = 10.
6. So, Steven has 10 books.
7. Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.
8. Clara has 20 books.
9. The difference between Clara and Alice is 20 - 16 = 4.

Yes, that all adds up. So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. I converted the word problem into algebraic expressions, solved for the unknown variable, and then found the required difference. It all seems consistent.

Just to visualize it, let me write it out:

- Let S = number of books Steven has.
- Alice has S + 6.
- Clara has 2S.
- Given that Clara has 20, so 2S = 20 => S = 10.
- Therefore, Alice has 10 + 6 = 16.
- Difference between Clara and Alice: 20 - 16 = 4.

Yep, that's correct. I think I'm confident with this answer.

**Final Answer**
Clara has \boxed{4} more books than Alice.
</think>

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has. According to the problem, Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has \( S + 6 \) books. Clara has twice as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books. We know that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2S = 20 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Thus, Steven has 10 books
