Q: Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50. One pair of pants costs $22.50 and one pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all the clothing items?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items she bought. Let me see, she bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each of these has a different cost. 

First, let me note down the costs for each item. Shorts are $16.50 each, pants are $22.50 each, and shoes are $42 each. So, she bought three of each. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then add them all together.

Let me start with the shorts. Each pair is $16.50, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I should multiply 16.50 by 3. Let me write that down: 16.50 * 3. Hmm, 16 times 3 is 48, and 0.50 times 3 is 1.50, so adding those together, 48 + 1.50 is 49.50. So, the total cost for the shorts is $49.50.

Next, let's move on the pants. Each pair is $22.50, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I need to multiply 22.50 by 3. Let me do that step by step. 22 times 3 is 66, and 0.50 times 3 is 1.50. So, adding those together, 66 + 1.50 is 67.50. So, the total cost for the pants is $67.50.

Now, onto the shoes. Each pair is $42, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I need to multiply 42 by 3. 40 times 3 is 120, and 2 times 3 is 6, so adding those together, 120 + 6 is 126. So, the total cost for the shoes is $126.00.

Alright, now I have the total costs for each type of clothing: shorts at $49.50, pants at $67.50, and shoes at $126.00. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake there. Let me check the multiplication again for the shoes. 42 times 3 is indeed 126, so that's correct. 

Wait, but when I added the shorts and pants, I had $49.50 and $67.50. Let me add those together first before adding the shoes. So, $49.50 plus $67.50. Let's see, 49 + 67 is 116, and 0.50 + 0.50 is 1.00. So, 116 + 1.00 is $117.00. Then, adding the shoes, which is $126.00, so 117 + 126 is 243. So, the total amount she spent is $243.00.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I messed up the multiplication for the shorts or pants.

Starting with shorts: 16.50 * 3. 16 * 3 is 48, and 0.50 *3 is 1.50, so 48 + 1.50 is 49.50. That seems correct.

Pants: 22.50 *3. 22 *3 is 66, and 0.50 *3 is 1.50, so 66 +1.50 is 67.50. That also seems correct.

Shoes: 42 *3. 40*3 is 120, and 2*3 is 6, so 120 +6 is 126.00. That's correct too.

So, adding shorts and pants: 49.50 +67.50. Let me add the dollars: 49 +67 is 116. Then, the cents: 50 +50 is 10.00. So, 116 +10 is 117.00. Then, adding the shoes: 117.00 +126.00. 117 +126 is 243.00. So, total is $243.00
