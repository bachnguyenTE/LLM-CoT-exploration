Q: Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?

Okay, so I have this problem about Jon and James doing a triathlon. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to figure out how long it took Jon to complete each part of the triathlon: swim, bike, and run. Then, I can use that information to determine how long it took James to do each part, especially focusing on the run.

Starting with Jon's times:

1. **Swim:** It takes Jon 40 minutes for the swim.
2. **Bike Ride:** It takes him an hour and 20 minutes. Hmm, an hour is 60 minutes, so 60 + 20 is 82 minutes.
3. **Run:** He takes 50 minutes for the run.

So, Jon's total time is 40 + 82 + 50 minutes. Let me add those up: 40 + 82 is 126, and 126 + 50 is 181 minutes. So, Jon finishes the triathlon in 181 minutes.

Now, the problem says that James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. I need to figure out what that means in terms of time. If something is 10% faster, that means he takes 10% less time than the original. So, if Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, James would take 44% of that time? Wait, no, that's not right. If it's 10% faster, that means he completes it in 10% less time. So, 10% of 44 minutes is 4.4 minutes. So, 44 - 4.4 is 39.6 minutes. Hmm, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think of it as 100% - 10% = 90% of the original time. So, 90% of 44 minutes is 0.9 * 44. Let me calculate that: 44 * 0.9 is 39.6 minutes. So, James takes 39.6 minutes for the swim.

Wait, but the problem also says that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride compared to Jon. Jon's bike ride is 82 minutes, so James's bike ride is 82 + 5 = 87 minutes.

So, now, I need to figure out how long it took James to do the run. The problem says that Jon won by 10 minutes. So, the difference between Jon's total time and James's total time is 10 minutes. So, if I can find James's total time, subtract 10 minutes from that, and that should give me his run time.

But wait, I don't know James's total time yet. Let me think. I know his swim time is 39.6 minutes, bike time is 87 minutes, and run time is what I need to find. So, if I can find his run time, I can add it up and subtract 10 minutes to get his total time, which should match Jon's total time minus 10 minutes.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says Jon won by 10 minutes. So, that means when both ran the triathlon, Jon finished 10 minutes before James. So, if I can find the difference in their total times, it's 10 minutes. So, if I can find James's total time, subtract 10 minutes, and that should equal Jon's total time. But I don't know either of their total times yet.

Wait, maybe I need to set up equations. Let me denote:

Let \( t_J \) be Jon's total time, which is 181 minutes.

Let \( t_J^{swim} \), \( t_J^{bike} \), \( t_J^{run} \) be the times for each part of Jon's triathlon.

Similarly, \( t_J^{swim} = 44 \) minutes, \( t_J^{bike} = 82 \) minutes, \( t_J^{run} = 50 \) minutes.

For James, let \( t_J^{swim}' \), \( t_J^{bike}' \), \( t_J^{run}' \) be his times.

Given:

1. \( t_J^{swim}' = 0.9 \times t_J^{swim} \) (10% faster)
2. \( t_J^{bike}' = t_J^{bike} + 5 \) minutes (5 minutes longer)
3. \( t_J^{swim}' + t_J^{bike}' + t_J^{run}' = t_J^{swim}' + t_J^{bike}' + t_J
