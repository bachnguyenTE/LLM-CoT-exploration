Q: In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. What's the total number of goals scored in the match?

Okay, so I have this soccer match problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I take it one piece at a time, I think I can figure it out.

First, the problem says: In the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. So, let me write that down.

In the first half:
- Team A: 4 goals
- Team B: 4 - 2 = 2 goals

Alright, that seems straightforward. So, in the first half, A has 4, B has 2.

Now, moving on to the second half. The problem states: In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

Hmm, that's a bit more complex. Let me parse this sentence by sentence.

First, "team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B." So, in the second half, team A's goals are 1/4 of team B's goals in the second half. Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Or is it 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read it again: "In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half."

So, the structure is: team A's goals = 1/4 of team B's goals in the second half. But team B's goals in the second half are 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

So, let's break it down:

First, team B's goals in the first half: 2.

Then, team B's goals in the second half: 4 times that, so 2 * 4 = 8.

So, in the second half, team B scores 8 goals.

Then, team A's goals in the second half: 1/4 of team B's second half goals, which is 1/4 of 8. So, 8 / 4 = 2.

So, in the second half:
- Team A: 2 goals
- Team B: 8 goals

Let me summarize:

First half:
- Team A: 4
- Team B: 2

Second half:
- Team A: 2
- Team B: 8

Now, to find the total number of goals scored in the match, I need to add up all the goals from both teams in both halves.

So, total goals for Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

Total goals for Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals in the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.

First half: A=4, B=2. That's 6 goals total.

Second half: A=2, B=8. That's 10 goals total.

6 + 10 is indeed 16. Hmm, but let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly.

The problem says: "In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half."

So, team B's first-half goals: 2.

Team B's second-half goals: 4 times that, so 8.

Team A's second-half goals: 1/4 of team B's second-half goals, so 2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the wording. Let me see: "which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half." So, team B's second-half goals are 4 times team B's first-half goals. So, 2 * 4 = 8. Then, team A's second-half goals are 1/4 of that, so 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So, adding up all the goals:

Team A: 4 + 2 = 6

Team B: 2 + 8 = 10

Total: 6 + 10 = 16.

Wait, 6 + 10 is 16, but 6 + 10 is 16? Wait, no, 2 + 8 is 10, so 4 + 2 is 6, 2 + 8 is 10, 6
