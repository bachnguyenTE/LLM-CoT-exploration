Q: Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't work those days. That means he sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Additionally, over the weekend, which I assume is Saturday and Sunday, he sold 20 crates. 

Let me list out the days and the number of crates he sold each day:

- Monday: Closed
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Friday: Closed
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: ?

Wait, hold on. The problem doesn't specify how many crates he sold on Saturday and Sunday. Hmm, that's a problem. It seems like I might be missing some information here. Let me check the original question again.

The question says: "Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?"

Wait, hold on, the target is 120 crates, not 122. Let me confirm: "He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week." So, 120, not 122. That was a typo in my initial reading.

So, the target is 120 crates. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't work those days. He sold 20 crates over the weekend, which I assume is Saturday and Sunday. Then, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he sold 15, 12, and 18 crates respectively.

So, let me list the days and the crates sold:

- Monday: 0 (closed)
- Tuesday: 15
- Wednesday: 12
- Thursday: 18
- Friday: 0 (closed)
- Saturday: 20
- Sunday: ?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify how many crates he sold on Sunday. Hmm, that's a problem. It seems like we're missing information about Sunday. Maybe it's implied? Or perhaps it's not needed? Let me think.

Wait, the problem says he sold 20 crates over the weekend, which is Saturday and Sunday. So, if he sold 20 crates over the weekend, that includes Saturday and Sunday. So, if he sold 20 crates over the weekend, and we know he sold 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 18 on Thursday, and 20 on Saturday, then Sunday's sales would be 20 - 20 = 0? Wait, that can't be right because 15+12+18+20=65, and 120-65=55. So, if he sold 20 over the weekend, that would mean he sold 20 on Saturday and Sunday, so Sunday would be 20 - Saturday's sales. But we don't know Saturday's sales.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again:

"Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?"

Wait, so over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. So, Saturday and Sunday, he sold 20 crates. So, if we add up the crates he sold on the other days, that's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

So, let's calculate the total he actually sold:

- Tuesday: 15
- Wednesday:12
- Thursday:18
- Saturday:20
- Sunday: ?

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many he sold on Sunday. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe it's implied? Or perhaps it's not needed because the target is 120, and we can calculate the difference.

Wait, let me think. The target is 120. So, if we can calculate the total he actually sold, and then subtract that from 120, we can find how many crates he was off by.

But the problem is, we don't know how many he sold on Sunday. So
