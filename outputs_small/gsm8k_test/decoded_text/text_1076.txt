Q: Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, nine burger platters for $11 each, and 20 sodas for $1.50 each. How much money does he make in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling milkshakes. Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, so I'll multiply 6 by $5.50 to find the total from milkshakes.

Next, I'll calculate the total revenue from burger platters. There are 9 burger platters sold at $11 each, so I'll multiply 9 by $11.00 to find the total from burger platters.

Then, I'll calculate the total revenue from sodas. There are 20 sodas sold at $1.50 each, so I'll multiply 20 by $1.50 to find the total from sodas.

Finally, I'll add up the totals from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas to find the overall total revenue.

**Solution:**

To determine how much money Terry makes in total, we'll calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - **Number sold:** 6
   - **Price per milkshake:** \$5.50
   - **Total revenue from milkshakes:**  
     \[
     6 \times \$5.50 = \$33.00
     \]

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - **Number sold:** 9
   - **Price per burger platter:** \$11.00
   - **Total revenue from burger platters:**  
     \[
     9 \times \$11.00 = \$99.00
     \]

3. **Sodas:**
   - **Number sold:** 20
   - **Price per soda:** \$1.50
   - **Total revenue from sodas:**  
     \[
     20 \times \$1.50 = \$30.00
     \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   - **Sum of all revenues:**  
     \[
     \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$162.00}
\]
