Q: Sarah has 9 books and Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, but he lost 2 of them. How many books does Joseph currently have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many books Joseph initially had. Since he had twice as many books as Sarah, and Sarah has 9 books, I can calculate Joseph's initial number of books by multiplying 9 by 2.

Next, I account for the books Joseph lost. He lost 2 books, so I subtract 2 from his initial number of books to find out how many he has now.

Finally, I'll present the final answer.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the initial number of books Joseph had:**
   
   - Sarah has **9** books.
   - Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books.
   
   \[
   \text{Joseph's initial books} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

2. **Account for the books Joseph lost:**
   
   - Joseph lost **2** books.
   
   \[
   \text{Joseph's current books} = 18 - 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
