Q: Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Okay, so Cecilia just got a new puppy, and she needs to figure out how many bags of dog food she'll use in the first year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that a year has 365 days, right? Wait, actually, sometimes people count a year as 365 days, but sometimes it's 366 days because of leap years. Hmm, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should just go with 365 days. I think that's a common approximation. So, 365 days in a year.

Now, according to her vet, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. So, that's the first part of the year. Then, after that, she has to feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of the year. So, I need to figure out how many days are in the first 180 days, how many days are left after that, and then calculate the total cups of food needed.

Let me write this down:

Total days in a year: 365 days (assuming no leap year)
First feeding period: 180 days
Second feeding period: 365 - 180 = 185 days

Wait, 365 minus 180 is 185? Let me check that. 180 plus 185 is 365. Yes, that's correct.

So, for the first 180 days, she feeds 1 cup each day. So, the total cups for the first part would be 180 cups.

Then, for the remaining 185 days, she feeds 2 cups each day. So, that would be 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

So, total cups needed in the first year would be 180 + 370. Wait, 185 * 2 is 370, right? So, 180 + 370 is 550 cups.

Wait, hold on, 180 + 370 is 550? Let me add that again. 180 + 370: 100 + 300 is 400, 80 +70 is 150, so 400 +150 is 550. Yeah, that's correct.

So, total cups needed is 550 cups.

Now, each bag has 110 cups. So, to find out how many bags she needs, I need to divide the total cups by the cups per bag.

So, 550 divided by 110. Let me compute that.

550 ÷ 110. Hmm, 110 goes into 550 how many times? Well, 110 times 5 is 550. So, 5 bags.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, 5 bags.

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 180 days at 1 cup: 180 cups.

Then, 185 days at 2 cups: 185 * 2 = 370 cups.

Total: 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

550 divided by 110 is 5, because 110*5=550.

So, yes, 5 bags.

Wait, but hold on, is there a possibility that the first 180 days include some leap years or something? But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume it's 365 days.

Alternatively, if it's 366 days, then the first 180 days would still be 180 days, and the remaining would be 186 days. Let me check that.

366 -180 = 186.

So, 186 days at 2 cups: 186*2=372.

Total cups: 180 + 372=552.

552 divided by 110 is approximately 4.927, which would round up to 5 bags. So, same result.

But since the problem didn't specify, I think 365 is the standard, so 5 bags.

Wait, but let me think again. The first feeding is 1 cup for the first 180 days, then 2 cups for the rest. So, 180 days at 1 cup, 18
