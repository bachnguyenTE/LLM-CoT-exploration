Q: At a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many students are at that grade level. Let me read it again: "At a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?" Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. That means that the remaining students don't have one. So, if three-fourths have it, then the rest must be the ones without. Let me write that down to visualize it better.

Let me denote the total number of students as \( x \). So, three-fourths of \( x \) is \( \frac{3}{4}x \), and the remaining students without desktop computers would be \( x - \frac{3}{4}x \). The problem states that this number is 20 students. So, I can set up an equation:

\( x - \frac{3}{4}x = 20 \)

Hmm, let me simplify that. Subtracting \( \frac{3}{4}x \) from \( x \) is the same as \( \frac{1}{4}x \), right? Because \( x \) is the same as \( \frac{4}{4}x \), so \( \frac{4}{4}x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x \). So, the equation becomes:

\( \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \)

Alright, so to find \( x \), I need to solve for it. Since \( \frac{1}{4}x = 20 \), I can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get \( x \) by itself. Let me do that:

\( x = 20 \times 4 \)

Calculating that, 20 times 4 is 80. So, \( x = 80 \). Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If three-fourths of 80 is the number of students with desktop computers, let's calculate that. Three-fourths of 80 is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \). Let me compute that: 80 divided by 4 is 20, and 20 times 3 is 60. So, 60 students have desktop computers.

Then, the number of students without desktop computers would be the total minus those who have, which is 80 - 60 = 20. That matches the given information in the problem. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions. If 20 students represent the remaining one-fourth, then each fourth is 20 students. So, the total number of students is 4 times 20, which is 80. Yep, that also gives me 80.

I think that's solid. So, the total number of students is 80.

**Final Answer**
The total number of students at that grade level is \boxed{80}.

Let \( x \) be the total number of students at that grade level. According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, and the remaining one-fourth do not. We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer. 

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at that grade level is \boxed{80}.
