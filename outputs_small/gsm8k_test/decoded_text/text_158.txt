Q: Raphael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost $1.5 each, 2 notebooks which cost $4 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $20. How much did Raphael spend on everything?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Raphael spent on school supplies. Let me break this down step by step. First, he bought pens, notebooks, and a bond paper. I'll calculate each item separately and then add them up.

Starting with the pens. He bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. Hmm, so I need to multiply the number of pens by the cost per pen. Let me write that down: 4 pens * $1.5 per pen. Let me do the multiplication. 4 times 1 is 4, and 4 times 0.5 is 2. So, 4 + 2 is $6. So, the pens cost $6 in total.

Next, the notebooks. He bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4. So, that's 2 * $4. Let me calculate that. 2 times 4 is 8. So, the notebooks cost $8 altogether.

Then, there's the bond paper, which costs $20. Wait, is that $20 or $200? Hmm, I think it's $20 because in the question it's written as $20. So, the bond paper is $20. So, that's $20.

Now, I need to add up all these amounts: pens, notebooks, and bond paper. So, $6 for pens, $8 for notebooks, and $20 for the bond paper. Let me add them one by one.

First, add the pens and notebooks: $6 + $8. That's straightforward, 6 + 8 is 14. So, together, pens and notebooks cost $14.

Now, add the bond paper to that. So, $14 + $20. Hmm, 14 + 20. Let me think, 14 + 20 is 34. So, the total amount spent is $34.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 4 pens at $1.5 each: 4 * 1.5. 1.5 is the same as 1 and a half, so 4 * 1 is 4, and 4 * 0.5 is 2, so 4 + 2 is 6. That's correct.

2 notebooks at $4 each: 2 * 4 is 8. That's correct.

Bond paper is $20. So, 6 + 8 is 14, and 14 + 20 is 34. So, yes, that adds up.

Wait, hold on, bond paper is $20? So, 6 + 8 is 14, plus 20 is 34. So, $34 total. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but considering he bought 4 pens and 2 notebooks, which are cheaper, maybe it's right.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the bond paper cost. Let me check the question again. It says a rim of bond paper which cost $20. So, yes, that's $20. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the bond paper is $20, so 6 + 8 is 14, plus 20 is 34. So, $34? Wait, no, 14 + 20 is 34. Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? No, that's not right. 14 + 20 is 34. Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, no, 14 + 20 is 34. Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20 is 34? Wait, 14 + 20
