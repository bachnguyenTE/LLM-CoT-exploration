Q: Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Luke, Thomas, and John eating hot dogs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. 

First, the problem says Luke ate 2 hot dogs. That's straightforward. So, Luke's consumption is 2. Now, Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Hmm, wait, does "three times more" mean he ate three times as many as Luke, or is it three times as many as Luke plus three? I think it's the former because "times more" usually means multiplication. So, if Luke ate 2, Thomas ate 3 times that. Let me write that down.

Luke: 2 hot dogs.

Thomas: 3 times Luke's amount. So, 3 * 2 = 6. So, Thomas ate 6 hot dogs. Got that.

Now, John ate half the amount Thomas ate. So, if Thomas ate 6, John ate half of that. Let me calculate that. Half of 6 is 3. So, John ate 3 hot dogs.

Now, the question is asking how many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke. So, we need to find the difference between John's consumption and Luke's consumption.

John: 3 hot dogs.

Luke: 2 hot dogs.

Difference: 3 - 2 = 1.

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. That seems pretty straightforward. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs. That's clear.

2. Thomas ate three times more than Luke. So, 3 * 2 = 6. That makes sense because "three times more" means 3 times the original amount.

3. John ate half of what Thomas ate. So, 6 / 2 = 3. That also makes sense.

4. The difference between John and Luke is 3 - 2 = 1. Yep, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems pretty simple once I broke it down step by step. So, the answer should be 1 more hot dog.

**Final Answer**
John ate \boxed{1} more hot dog than Luke.
</think>

Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, which means Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) hot dogs. The difference between the number of hot dogs John ate and Luke ate is \(3 - 2 = 1\).

\[
\boxed{1}
