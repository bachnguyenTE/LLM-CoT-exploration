Q: Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. I need to find the probability that both tickets are winners, and express it as a percentage. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities of independent events, the probability that both events occur is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if the two events are independent, which I think they are in this case because the outcome of one doesn't affect the other, then I can multiply the probabilities together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. I should probably convert that to a decimal to make the multiplication easier. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, the probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2.

Now, the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. That means if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second one has 3 times that. So, 3 times 20% is 60%. Let me write that down. 3 * 20% = 60%. So, the probability of the second ticket winning is 0.6.

Wait, hold on, is that right? If the second ticket is three times more likely, does that mean it's 20% + 3 times 20%? Or is it 3 times the probability of the first? Hmm, the wording says "three times more likely to win." So, I think that means it's 3 times the probability of the first. So, 3 * 20% = 60%. So, 0.6 is correct.

So, now I have the probability of the first ticket winning as 0.2 and the second as 0.6. Since these are independent events, the probability that both happen is 0.2 * 0.6.

Let me calculate that. 0.2 multiplied by 0.6 is... 0.12. So, 0.12 is the probability that both tickets are winners.

But the question asks for the probability expressed as a percentage. So, I need to convert 0.12 into a percentage. To do that, I multiply by 100. So, 0.12 * 100 = 12%. So, the probability is 12%.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 20% is 0.2, 60% is 0.6, 0.2 * 0.6 is 0.12, which is 12%. That seems right.

But just to make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says the second ticket is three times more likely to win. So, is that 3 times the probability of the first, or 3 times the chance of winning? Hmm, in probability terms, "three times more likely" usually means 3 times the probability. So, if the first is 20%, the second is 60%. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people might interpret it as 20% plus three times 20%, which would be 20% + 60% = 80%, but that doesn't make sense because that would mean the second ticket is 80% likely, which is not three times more likely. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the second ticket is 3 times the probability of the first, so 60%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

Wait, hold on, 0.2 * 0.6 is 0.12, which is 12%, right? So, 12% is the correct answer.

I think that's it. So, the probability is 12%.

**Final Answer**
The probability that both tickets are winners is \boxed{12\%}.

Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability is 3 times 20%, which is 60% or 0.6 in decimal form.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the individual probabilities:

\[
0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12
\]

Converting this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \boxed{12\%}.
