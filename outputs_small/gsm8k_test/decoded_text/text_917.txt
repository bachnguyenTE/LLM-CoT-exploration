Q: Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas and 6 oranges at the grocery store. Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. How many pieces are left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought. She purchased 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. Adding these together gives 3 + 5 +6, which equals 14 pieces of fruit.

Next, Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. To find out how many pieces are left, I subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces. So, 14 minus 2 equals 12.

Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left.

**Solution:**

Kira bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. To find the total number of pieces of fruit, we add these together:

\[
3 \text{ apples} + 5 \text{ bananas} + 6 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ pieces of fruit}
\]

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit. To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pieces:

\[
14 \text{ pieces} - 2 \text{ pieces} = 12 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
