Okay, so I have this problem here about John and Jack walking to school together. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says they have 30 minutes to walk to school. That's the total time they have. Then, it mentions that it takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. After that, it takes another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. The question is asking how much longer they have to walk to school without being late.

Hmm, so I think I need to figure out how much time they've already used and then subtract that from the total time to find out how much more they have left. Let me write that down.

Total time available: 30 minutes.

Time taken to get to the library: 6 minutes.

Time taken from the library to the fire station: 13 minutes.

So, the total time they've already spent walking is 6 minutes plus 13 minutes. Let me add those together. 6 plus 13 is 19 minutes. So, they've already used 19 minutes of their 30-minute window.

Now, to find out how much more time they have left, I subtract the time already used from the total time. That would be 30 minutes minus 19 minutes. Let me do that subtraction. 30 minus 19 is... hmm, 11. So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

Wait, let me double-check that. 6 minutes to the library, 13 minutes from the library to the fire station. 6 plus 13 is definitely 19. 30 minus 19 is 11. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. They have 11 minutes left. So, the answer should be 11 minutes.

**Final Answer**
They have \boxed{11} more minutes to get to school without being late.

John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we calculate the total time they have already spent walking:
\[
6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we subtract the time already used from the total time available to find out how much more time they have left:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, they have \boxed{11} more minutes to get to school without being late.
