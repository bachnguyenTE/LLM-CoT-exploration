Q: Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got. If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Amora, Lainey, and Collins wanted to share corn chips equally. But then they realized only two people would get an equal amount, and the third person would get 15 more corn chips than the others. Specifically, Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and I need to find out how many corn chips there were altogether.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, initially, they wanted to share the corn chips equally among three people. So, if they had three people, each would get the same amount. But then, they realized that only two people would get an equal amount, and the third person would get 15 more than the others. So, that means two people got 70 each, and the third person got 70 + 5 = 75. Wait, no, hold on. The problem says Amora and Lainey got 70 each, so maybe the third person got 70 +5 =75? But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got." Hmm, so if Amora and Lainey got 70 each, then the third person would get 70 +15 =85. So, that makes sense. So, two people got 70 each, and one person got 85. So, total corn chips would be 70 +70 +85. Let me calculate that.

70 +70 is 140, and 140 +85 is 225. So, total corn chips would be 225. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly.

The problem says: "they wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got." So, the two equal amounts are 70 each, and the third person gets 15 more than those, so 70 +15=85. So, 70,70,85. So, adding them up: 70+70=140, 140+85=225. So, 225 total corn chips.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the 15 more the difference between the two equal amounts and the third person? Or is it 15 more than the others? The problem says: "the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got." So, the others got 70 each, so the third person got 70 +15=85. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 70 +15=85. So, same thing. So, total is 70+70+85=225.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is there another way to interpret it? Maybe the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them, so 70 +15=85. So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 15 more than the equal amount, so 70 +15=85. So, same thing.

So, total is 70+70+85=225.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way. Maybe the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 15 more than each of them, so 70 +15=85. So, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 15 more than the equal amount, so 70 +15=85. So, same thing.

So, regardless of how I interpret it, the total is 225.

Wait, but let me check the problem again: "they wanted to share corn chips equally but then realized only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got." So, the two equal people got 70 each, and the third person got 15 more than the others, which are 70 each. So, 70 +15=85.

So, 70,70,85. So, 70+70=140, 140+85=225.

So
