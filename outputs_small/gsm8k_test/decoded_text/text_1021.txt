Q: In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this quiz problem here, and I need to figure out how many points Aries is sure to get. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The quiz has 60 items. Hmm, wait, 60? That seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 60? Or maybe 60 is a different number. Wait, no, 60 is 60, which is 60 items. Hmm, okay, maybe it's 60. Let me go with that for now.

Out of these 60 questions, 40% are easy. So, 40% are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. So, first, let me figure out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are.

40% of 60 is easy. So, 0.4 * 60. Let me calculate that. 0.4 times 60. Well, 0.4 is the same as 40%, so 40% of 60. Let me compute 40% of 60.

40% of 60 is equal to (40/100)*60. Let me compute that. 40 divided by 100 is 0.4, so 0.4 times 60. 0.4 times 60. Let me do 0.4*60. 0.4*60 is 24. So, 24 easy questions.

Okay, so 24 easy questions. The rest are equally divided as average and difficult. So, total questions are 60, 24 are easy, so the remaining is 60 - 24 = 36 questions. So, 36 questions are average and difficult. Since they are equally divided, that means 18 average and 18 difficult? Wait, no, 36 divided by 2 is 18 each. Wait, 36 divided by 2 is 18. So, 18 average and 18 difficult? Wait, no, 36 divided by 2 is 18 each. So, 18 average and 18 difficult.

Wait, hold on, 24 easy, 18 average, 18 difficult. Let me check: 24 + 18 + 18 is 60. Yes, that adds up. Okay, so 24 easy, 18 average, 18 difficult.

Now, Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. So, 75% of 24. Let me compute that. 0.75 * 24. 0.75 is three-fourths, so three-fourths of 24 is 18. So, Aries gets 18 easy questions correct.

Then, half of the average and difficult questions correctly. So, for the average questions, half of 18 is 9. Similarly, half of the difficult questions, which is 18, is 9. So, Aries gets 9 average and 9 difficult questions correct.

So, total points Aries is sure to get is easy + average + difficult. So, 18 + 9 + 9. Let me add that up. 18 + 9 is 27, plus another 9 is 36. So, 36 points.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, total questions: 60. 40% are easy. 0.4*60 is 24. Correct. Then, 60 - 24 is 36. 36 divided by 2 is 18 each. So, 18 average and 18 difficult. Correct.

Then, 75% of easy: 0.75*24. Let me compute 24*0.75. 24*0.75 is 18. Correct. Then, half of average: 18/2 is 9. Half of difficult: 18/2 is 9. So, 18 + 9 + 9 is 36. That seems right.

Wait, but 36 seems a bit low. Let me think again. 75% of 24 is 18, which is correct. Then, 9 average and 9 difficult, so 18. So, 18 + 9 +9 is 36. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 75% of
