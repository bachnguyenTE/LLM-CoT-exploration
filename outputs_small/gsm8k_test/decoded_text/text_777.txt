Q: Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?

Okay, so Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions. He currently has 600 movies. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, he has 600 movies in total. The problem says that a third of these are in various series. So, I need to figure out how many of these are series and how many are normal movies.

A third of 600 is 600 divided by 3, which is 220. So, 220 movies are in various series. The rest must be normal movies. So, 600 minus 220 is 380. So, 380 normal movies.

Now, the problem says that for the series movies, Mike can get them for only $6 each, which is the cost of a normal movie by buying the series together. Wait, so a normal movie is $10, so $6 is the cost of a series movie. So, each series movie is $6, and the normal ones are $10.

So, for the 220 series movies, each costs $6. So, the total cost for these would be 220 multiplied by 6. Let me calculate that: 220 * 6. Hmm, 200*6 is 1200, and 2*6 is 12, so 1200 + 12 is 1212. So, $1212 for the series movies.

Now, the remaining 380 movies are older movies, and each of these costs $5. So, the total cost for these would be 380 multiplied by 5. Let me compute that: 380*5. 300*5 is 1500, and 80*5 is 400, so 1500 + 400 is 1900. So, $1900 for the older movies.

Wait, hold on, the problem says that a normal movie costs $10. So, older movies are $5 each, which is half the price of a normal movie. That makes sense.

So, now, to find the total cost, I need to add the cost of the series movies and the cost of the older movies. So, $1212 plus $1900. Let me add those together: 1212 + 1900. 1200 + 1900 is 2100, and 12 + 0 is 12, so total is 2112. So, $2112.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because I might have messed up somewhere.

First, 220 series movies at $6 each: 220*6. Let me compute 200*6=1200, and 20*6=120, so 1200 + 120=1320. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, 220*6: 200*6=1200, 20*6=120, so 1200+120=1320. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 220*6: 200*6=1200, 20*6=132, so 1200+132=1332. Hmm, that's different. Wait, no, 220 is 200+2, so 200*6=1320, 2*6=12, so 1320+12=1332. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should just do 220*6. Let me write it out:

220
x 6
-----
1320

Wait, 220*6: 0*6=0, 2*6=12, 2*6=12, so 1320. So, 220*6=1320. So, that's $1320 for the series movies.

Then, the older movies: 380*5. 380*5: 300*5=1500, 80*5=400, so 1500+400=1900. So, $1900 for the older movies.

So, total cost is 1320 + 1
