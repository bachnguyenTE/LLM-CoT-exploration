Q: It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?

Okay, so I have this problem about Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy picking strawberries on Grandma's farm. It's strawberry-picking time, which I guess means it's a good time to get some strawberries. The question is asking how many quarts of strawberries they can pick together per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony. So, if Tony is picking 6, Bobby must be picking 6 minus 1, which is 5 quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Since Bobby picks 5 quarts, Kathy must be picking 5 times 2, which is 10 quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. So, if Kathy is picking 10 quarts, then Ricky is picking 10 minus 2, which is 8 quarts per hour.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I got that right. So, Tony is 6, Bobby is 5, Kathy is 10, and then Ricky is 8. Let me add those up to see if that makes sense.

So, Tony: 6, Bobby:5, Kathy:10, and Ricky:8. Let me add them together: 6 + 5 is 11, plus 10 is 21, plus 8 is 29. So, altogether, they can pick 29 quarts per hour.

Wait, let me double-check each person's rate to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Tony is given as 6 quarts per hour. That's straightforward. 

Bobby picks one less than Tony, so 6 - 1 = 5. That seems right.

Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby. So, 5 times 2 is 10. That makes sense.

Ricky picks two fewer than Kathy. So, 10 - 2 = 8. That also seems correct.

Adding them up: 6 + 5 is 11, 11 + 10 is 21, 21 + 8 is 29. So, 29 quarts per hour in total.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes when I do these problems, I might misread the relationships. Let me make sure each person's rate is correctly calculated.

Tony: 6 quarts per hour. That's given.

Bobby: one less than Tony. So, 6 - 1 = 5. Correct.

Kathy: twice as much as Bobby. So, 5 * 2 = 10. Correct.

Ricky: two fewer than Kathy. So, 10 - 2 = 8. Correct.

So, each person's rate is correct. Then, adding them up: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8.

Let me add them in a different order to check. 6 + 5 is 11, 11 + 10 is 21, 21 + 8 is 29. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, I can add them in pairs. 6 + 10 is 16, and 5 + 8 is 13. Then, 16 + 13 is 19. Still the same.

Wait, hold on, 6 + 10 is 16, 5 + 8 is 13, 16 +13 is 29. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6 + 10 is 16, 5 + 8 is 13, so 16 +13 is 29. Wait, that's different. Wait, no, 6 + 10 is 16, 5 +8 is 13, so 16 +13 is 29. Wait, but earlier I had 6 +5 +10 +8 =29. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in my first addition, I had 6 +5 +10 +8. So, 6 +5 is 11, 11 +10 is 21, 21 +8 is 29. So, same result.

Wait, but in the second way, I added 6 +10 is 16, 5 +8 is 13, 16 +13 is 29. Wait, that's not right because 16 +13 is 29, but 6 +10 +5 +8 is 29? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 6
