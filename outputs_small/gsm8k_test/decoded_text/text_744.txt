Q: Melissa works as a pet groomer. This week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Melissa and her pet groomer. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The question is asking how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week. She has different grooming jobs for dogs, cats, birds, and horses. Each of these jobs has a specific number of animals that need grooming. So, I think I need to add up all the animals and then divide them by the number of days in a week, which is 7. That should give me the number of animals she'll groom each day.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. She has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. So, the total number of animals is 8 + 5 + 3 + 12. Let me add those up. 8 plus 5 is 13, then 13 plus 3 is 16, and 16 plus 12 is 28. So, there are 28 animals in total that need grooming this week.

Now, since she's splitting the jobs evenly over the week, which has 7 days, I need to divide the total number of animals by 7. So, 28 divided by 7. Hmm, 7 goes into 28 exactly 4 times because 7 times 4 is 28. So, 28 divided by 7 is 4. That means Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

Wait, let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, 12 horses. 8+5 is 13, 13+3 is 16, 16+12 is 28. Yeah, that's correct. And 28 divided by 7 is 4 with a remainder of 4, but since we're talking about whole animals, it's 4 each day. So, the answer should be 4.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is straightforward: add up all the animals and divide by the number of days. So, 28 divided by 7 is 4. So, the answer is 4 animals per day.

**Final Answer**
The number of animals Melissa will groom each day is \boxed{4}.

Melissa works as a pet groomer and has different grooming jobs for dogs, cats, birds, and horses. The total number of animals is calculated as follows:

- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together: \(8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28\).

Melissa splits the grooming jobs evenly over 7 days. Therefore, the number of animals she will groom each day is:

\[
\frac{28}{7} = 4
\]

The number of animals Melissa will groom each day is \(\boxed{4}\).
