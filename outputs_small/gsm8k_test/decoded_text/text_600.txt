Q: Jamaal is at the gym. He has been using an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight that he uses by 50%. It turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jamaal and the weight he's using at the gym. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Jamaal is using an 8-pound weight. Hmm, okay, so initially, he's using 8 pounds. Then, he increases the weight by 50%. Hmm, increasing by 50%... I think that means he's going to add half of the original weight to it. So, 50% of 8 pounds. Let me calculate that. 

50% is the same as 0.5 in decimal form. So, 0.5 times 8 is... 4. So, 50% of 8 is 4 pounds. So, if he increases the weight by 50%, he adds 4 pounds to the original 8 pounds. That makes the new weight 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

Wait, but the problem says it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, he goes back down by 2 pounds from 12 pounds. So, 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. 

So, is the answer 10 pounds? Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Start with 8 pounds. Increase by 50%: 8 * 1.5 = 12 pounds. Then decrease by 2 pounds: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. Yeah, that seems right. 

Wait, hold on, 50% increase is 4 pounds, so 8 + 4 is 12. Then, 12 minus 2 is 10. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final weight is 10 pounds. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. So, I think the answer is 10 pounds. 

**Final Answer**
The weight that Jamaal now uses is \boxed{10} pounds.

Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. He increases this weight by 50%, which is calculated as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the weight turns out to be too heavy, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} \text{ less than } 12 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds.
