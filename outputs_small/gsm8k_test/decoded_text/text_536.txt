Q: Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. How old is Anne if she is 2 years older than Alyana?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Chenny is 10 years old. Wait, hold on, the user wrote 10, but in the question, it says Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Let me check the original problem again. It says, "Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. How old is Anne if she is 2 years older than Alyana?" So, Chenny is 10, Alyana is 4 years younger, so that would make Alyana 6, right? Then Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so that would be 8. Wait, but the user wrote 10, which is 10. Maybe that's a mistake. Let me see.

Wait, no, hold on. The user wrote "A: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." So maybe the initial problem was different. Let me read the problem again: "Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. How old is Anne if she is 2 years older than Alyana?" So, Chenny is 10, so that's 10 years old. Then Alyana is 4 years younger, so 10 - 4 = 6. Then Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so 6 + 2 = 8. So, Anne is 8 years old.

Wait, but the user wrote 10, which is 10, but in the problem, it's 10. Maybe that's a typo. Let me see. If Chenny is 10, then Alyana is 6, and Anne is 8. So, the answer is 8. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to be Chenny is 10, Alyana is 4 years younger, so 6, and Anne is 2 years older, so 8. So, yeah, 8 is the answer. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but the user wrote 10, but in the problem, it's 10. So, maybe it's a typo. So, regardless, the answer is 8. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{8}
</think>

Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is \(10 - 4 = 6\) years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is \(6 + 2 = 8\) years old.

\[
\boxed{8}
