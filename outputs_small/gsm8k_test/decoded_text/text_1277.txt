Q: Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. If Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old, what's the average of their ages?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age. Mia is younger than Emma, and she's 40 years old. I need to find the average of their ages. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me note down the information given. Mia is 40 years old, and she's 16 years younger than Emma. So, if Mia is 40, then Emma must be 40 + 16, right? Let me write that down.

Mia's age = 40 years
Difference in age = 16 years
Emma's age = Mia's age + Difference in age
So, Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, Mia is 40, Emma is 56. Now, to find the average of their ages, I need to add their ages together and then divide by 2.

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
So, plugging in the numbers: Average = (40 + 56)/2

Wait, hold on, 40 + 56 is 96? Let me check that again. 40 + 56 is 96? No, wait, 40 + 56 is 96? No, that can't be right. 40 + 56 is 96? Wait, 40 + 56 is 96? No, 40 is 40, 56 is 56, so 40 + 56 is 96? Wait, 40 + 50 is 90, plus 6 is 96. Yeah, that's correct. So, 40 + 56 is 96.

So, the average is 96 divided by 2, which is 48. So, the average of their ages is 48.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Emma's age. If Mia is 40 and she's 16 years younger than Emma, then Emma is 40 +16, which is 56. Yeah, that's correct. So, 40 +16 is 56. So, that's right.

So, adding 40 and 56 gives 96, and dividing by 2 gives 48. So, the average age is 48.

Wait, but just to double-check, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using algebra.

Let me denote Mia's age as M and Emma's age as E. We know that M = 40, and E = M +16. So, E = 40 +16 =56. Then, the average is (M + E)/2 = (40 +56)/2 =96/2=48.

Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think 48 is the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think about the problem again. Mia is younger than Emma, 16 years apart. Mia is 40, so Emma is 56. So, their ages are 40 and 56. The average is (40 +56)/2=48. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to correctly interpret the age difference. Since Mia is younger, her age is less than Emma's, so adding 16 to Mia's age gives Emma's age. Then, averaging them gives the result.

So, I think the answer is 48.

**Final Answer**
The average of their ages is \boxed{48}.
</think>

Mia is currently 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma. To find Emma's age, we add 16 to Mia's age:

\[
\text{Emma's age} = 40 + 16 = 56
\]

Next, we calculate the average of their ages by adding their ages together and dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

Thus, the average of their ages is \boxed{48}.
