Q: If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what's given. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. So, if I think about it, that means in 5 days, one person is working on half the house. So, how much does one person paint in one day? Maybe I can find the rate at which one person paints.

If one person paints half a house in 5 days, then in one day, they paint half divided by 5, right? So, that would be (1/2) / 5, which is 1/10, which is 1/10? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it down.

Let me denote the work as painting a house. So, one person paints half a house in 5 days. So, the work done is 1/2 house. Time taken is 5 days. So, the rate is work over time, which is (1/2) house / 5 days = 1/10 house per day. So, that's 1/10 house per day. So, that means one person paints 1/10 of a house each day.

Wait, 1/10 is 0.1, so 0.1 houses per day. That seems a bit high, but okay, maybe it's correct. So, if one person paints 0.1 houses per day, then 5 people would paint 5 times that, right? So, 5 * 0.1 = 0.5 houses per day. So, 0.5 houses per day.

But the question is asking how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. So, if 5 people paint 0.5 houses in a day, then how many days would it take to paint 1 house?

So, if 0.5 houses take 1 day, then 1 house would take 2 days. So, 2 days. But the question is asking for hours, not days. So, 2 days is equal to 2 * 24 = 48 hours. So, 48 hours.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

So, one person paints half a house in 5 days. So, in 1 day, they paint half divided by 5, which is 1/10 of a house. So, 1/10 per day. So, 5 people would paint 5 * 1/10 = 1/2 of a house per day. So, 1/2 house per day. So, to paint 1 house, it would take 2 days. 2 days is 48 hours. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of person-days. Person-days is a way to calculate how much work is done. So, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then the total person-days required to paint half a house is 1 person * 5 days = 5 person-days. So, to paint half a house, it's 5 person-days. So, to paint a whole house, it would be 10 person-days.

So, if we have 5 people working, how many days would it take? So, 10 person-days divided by 5 people is 2 days. So, again, 2 days, which is 48 hours.

Wait, so both methods give me 48 hours. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the work rate. So, the work rate is 1/2 house per 5 days, so that's 1/10 house per day. So, 5 people working together would have a combined rate of 5 * 1/10 = 1/2 house per day. So, to paint 1 house, it's 2 days, which is 48 hours.

Wait, so all these methods are giving me 48 hours. So, that seems to be the answer.

But let me think again. Maybe I can approach it differently. Let's see.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then how much can they paint in one day? As I did before, 1/2 divided by 5 is 1/10. So, 1/10 of a house per day. So, 5 people would paint 5 * 1/10 = 1/2 per day. So, to paint 1 house, it's 2 days, which is
