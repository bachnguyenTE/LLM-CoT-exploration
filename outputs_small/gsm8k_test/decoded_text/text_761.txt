Q: Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jana's puppies, and I need to figure out how many puppies she has. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: "Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?"

Alright, let's parse this information. First, two-thirds of all Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, if I let the total number of puppies be, say, P, then the number of Pomeranians would be (2/3)P. That makes sense.

Next, it says that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, if there are (2/3)P Pomeranians, then the number of girls among them would be (1/3) of that. So, that would be (1/3)*(2/3)P, which simplifies to (2/9)P. Got that.

And the problem tells me that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, that means (2/9)P equals 6. So, I can set up an equation: (2/9)P = 6. Now, I need to solve for P, which is the total number of puppies.

Let me write that down:

(2/9)P = 6

To solve for P, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/9, which is 9/2. So, multiplying both sides by 9/2:

P = 6 * (9/2)

Let me compute that. 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 3 multiplied by 9 is 27. So, P equals 27.

Wait, so that would mean Jana has 27 puppies in total. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, if there are 27 puppies, two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. So, two-thirds of 27 is (2/3)*27. Let me compute that: 27 divided by 3 is 9, and 9 times 2 is 18. So, 18 Pomeranians.

Then, one third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, one third of 18 is 6. And that's exactly what the problem stated. So, that checks out.

So, yeah, 27 puppies in total. So, the answer should be 27.

But wait, let me think again. Sometimes, when dealing with fractions, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let me go through it again.

Total puppies: P

Pomeranians: (2/3)P

Girls among Pomeranians: (1/3)*(2/3)P = (2/9)P

Given that (2/9)P = 6, so P = 6*(9/2) = 27.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 27 puppies.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way. If 6 girls are one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is 6*3=18. Then, since two-thirds of the total puppies are Pomeranians, so 18 is two-thirds of the total. So, 18 is two-thirds, so total is 18*(3/2)=27. Yep, same answer.

So, that's another way to think about it, and it still gives me 27. So, that's consistent.

So, I think 27 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Jana has \boxed{27} puppies.
</think>

Let \( P \) be the total number of puppies Jana has. According to the problem, two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

One third of the Pomeranians are girls. Thus, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \).

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{9} \):
\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 6 \times 4.5 = 27
