Q: Helen went on a trip through Germany. She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?

Okay, so Helen went on a trip through Germany and spent money on a hotel and bus. I need to figure out how much she paid in total for both the hotel and the bus. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says she booked a hotel for 3 nights. Each night at the hotel costs $80. So, to find the total cost for the hotel, I should multiply the number of nights by the cost per night. That would be 3 nights multiplied by $80 per night. Let me write that out:

Hotel cost = 3 nights × $80/night

Hmm, 3 times 80. Let me calculate that. 3 times 80 is 240. So, the hotel cost is $240. That seems straightforward.

Next, she rode the bus 7 times during the trip. Each bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, first, I need to find out how much one bus trip costs. Since one night at the hotel is $80, 10% of that would be 0.10 multiplied by 80.

Let me compute that: 0.10 × 80. Hmm, 0.1 times 80 is 8.8. So, each bus trip costs $8.80.

Now, she took the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus would be 7 trips multiplied by the cost per trip. That would be 7 × $8.80. Let me calculate that.

7 times 8.80. Let me break that down. 7 times 8 is 56, and 7 times 0.80 is 5.89. So, adding those together, 56 + 5.89 is 61.89. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.

Wait, 8.80 times 7. Let me do it step by step. 8.80 × 7. 8 times 7 is 56, and 0.80 times 7 is 5.60. So, adding 56 and 5.60 gives 61.60. Oh, I see, I made a mistake in my initial calculation. It's actually $61.60 for the bus.

So, the total cost for the bus is $61.60.

Now, to find the total amount Helen paid for both the hotel and the bus, I need to add the hotel cost and the bus cost together. That would be $240 (which is $240, not $240.00, but just $240) plus $61.60.

Wait, hold on, $240 plus $61.60. Let me add those. 240 + 61.60. 240 + 60 is 300, and then +1.60 is 301.60. So, the total cost is $301.60.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with money, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, the hotel: 3 nights at $80 each. 3 × 80. 80 + 80 is 160, plus another 80 is 240. That's correct.

Then, the bus: 10% of $80 is 8.80. So, 7 times 8.80. Let me compute 8.80 × 7 again. 8 × 7 is 56, 0.80 × 7 is 5.60. So, 56 + 5.60 is 61.60. That's correct.

Adding 240 and 61.60: 240 + 61 is 241, plus 0.60 is 241.60. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, 240 + 61.60. 240 + 61 is 247, plus 0.60 is 247.60. Wait, that's not right either.

Wait, no, 240 + 61.60. Let me write it as 240.00 + 61.60. Adding the dollars: 240 + 61 is 241, and cents: 0 + 0.60 is 0.60. So, total is 2
