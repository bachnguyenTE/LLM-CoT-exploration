Q: Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ruiz and Marissa making chocolates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Hmm, so I need to find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in one hour. If she makes 120 pounds in two hours, then in one hour she would make half of that, right? So, 120 divided by 2 is 60. So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour. Got that.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz does in two hours. Wait, let me parse that again. It says Marissa makes 3/4 times as many as Ruiz does in an hour. So, first, I need to know how much Ruiz makes in an hour, which we already found out is 60 pounds. So, Marissa makes 3/4 of that per hour. 

Let me calculate that. 3/4 of 60. Hmm, 60 is the same as 60, right? So, 3/4 of 60. Let me do the math. 60 divided by 4 is 15.5, and then multiplied by 3 is 16.5. So, Marissa makes 16.5 pounds per hour. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 3/4 of 60 is 60.75? Wait, no, 60 divided by 4 is 15.5, and 15.5 times 3 is 46.5. Oh, wait, no, 15.5 times 3 is 46.5? Wait, 15 times 3 is 45, and 0.5 times 3 is 1.5, so 45 + 1.5 is 46.5. Yeah, that's correct. So, Marissa makes 16.5 pounds per hour. 

So, now, both Ruiz and Marissa are working for 12 hours a day. I need to find the total amount of chocolates they make together. 

First, let's calculate how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours, which is given as 120 pounds. But since they work for 12 hours, but the question is about 12 hours? Wait, no, the problem says they worked for 12 hours, but then it says if they worked for 12 hours, but then the question is about 12 hours? Wait, no, let me read again.

Wait, the problem says: "Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together."

Wait, so maybe I misread the initial part. It says, "Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours." Then, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many as Ruiz makes in two hours. So, Marissa's rate is 3/4 of 120 pounds per two hours. Wait, no, the problem says Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. So, in one hour, Marissa makes 3/4 times what Ruiz makes in two hours.

Wait, so first, let me clarify: Marissa's per-hour rate is 3/4 of Ruiz's per-hour rate. So, since we found that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, Marissa makes 3/4 * 60. Wait, 3/4 of 60 is 46.5, as I calculated before. So, Marissa makes 46.5 pounds per hour.

So, both of them are working for 12 hours. So, total chocolates made by Ruiz is 60 pounds per hour times 12 hours. And total chocolates made by Marissa is 46.5 pounds per hour times 12 hours. Then, add them together.

Let me compute that. 

Ruiz: 60 * 12. Let me calculate 60 *10 is 660, plus 60*2 is 126, so 660 + 126 is 786 pounds.

Marissa: 46.5 *12. Let me compute 46.5 *10 is 46.5, 46.5*2 is 93, so 46.5 + 93 is
