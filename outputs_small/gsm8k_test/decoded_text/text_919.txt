Q: To raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?

Okay, so I have this problem here where 30 students from one class are selling lollipops to raise money for their class fund. Each lollipops costs $0.8, and on average, each student sold 10 lollipops. They bought the lollipops for $0.5 each. I need to figure out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what the question is asking. They sold lollipops, each costing $0.8, and each student sold an average of 10. So, each student sold 10 lollipops. There are 30 students in total. So, the total number of lollipops sold should be 30 students multiplied by 10 lollipops per student. Let me write that down:

Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Okay, so they sold 300 lollipops in total. Each lollipops costs $0.8, so the total revenue from selling the lollipops would be the number sold multiplied by the price per lollipops. So, that would be:

Total revenue = 330 lollipops * $0.8/lollipops.

Wait, hold on, 330? Wait, 30 students times 10 lollipops each is 300 lollipops, right? So, 300? Wait, no, 30 students times 10 lollipops each is 330 lollipops. Wait, 30*10 is 330. So, 330 lollipops sold. So, total revenue is 330 * $0.8.

Let me calculate that. 330 * 0.8. Hmm, 300 * 0.8 is 240, and 30 * 0.8 is 24, so total is 240 + 24 = $264. So, total revenue is $264.

Now, they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each. So, the total cost for buying all the lollipops is the number of lollipops sold multiplied by the cost per lollipops. So, that's:

Total cost = 330 lollipops * $0.5/lollipops.

Calculating that, 330 * 0.5 is $165. So, total cost is $165.

Now, profit is total revenue minus total cost. So, profit = $264 - $165.

Let me compute that. 264 - 165. 264 - 160 is 104, and then subtract 5 more, so 104 - 5 = 99. So, profit is $99.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total lollipops sold: 30 students * 10 lollipops = 330 lollipops. Correct.

Total revenue: 330 * 0.8. Let me compute 330 * 0.8. 300 * 0.8 is 240, 30 * 0.8 is 24, so 240 + 24 = 264. Wait, hold on, 330 * 0.8. Maybe I did that wrong earlier.

Wait, 330 * 0.8. Let me compute 300 * 0.8 = 240, and 30 * 0.8 = 24, so 240 + 24 = 264. So, total revenue is $264.

Total cost: 330 * 0.5. 330 * 0.5 is 166.50. Wait, 330 * 0.5 is half of 330, which is 166.5. So, total cost is $166.50.

So, profit is 264 - 166.50. Let me compute that. 264 - 166.50. Hmm, 264 is 264.00, minus 166.50. So, 264 - 166
