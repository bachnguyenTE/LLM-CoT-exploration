Q: Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran 52 miles in total. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. How many miles did Ahito run?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. I need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. There are three people: Amber, Micah, and Ahito. The total miles they ran together is 52. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times the miles Amber ran. So, I need to find out how much Micah ran and then subtract both of their distances from the total to find out how much Ahito ran.

Let me write this down step by step. 

1. Total miles: 52
2. Amber's miles: 8
3. Micah's miles: 3.5 times Amber's miles

So, first, I can calculate Micah's miles. If Amber ran 8 miles, then Micah ran 3.5 times that. So, 3.5 multiplied by 8. Let me do that calculation.

3.5 * 8. Hmm, 3 times 8 is 24, and 0.5 times 8 is 4, so 24 + 4 is 28. So, Micah ran 28 miles.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3.5 is the same as 7/2, right? So, 7/2 times 8 is (7*8)/2, which is 56/2, which is 28. Yeah, that's correct. So, Micah ran 28 miles.

Now, I have the total miles, which is 52, and I know how much Amber and Micah ran. So, to find out how much Ahito ran, I can subtract the sum of Amber's and Micah's miles from the total.

So, let's add Amber's 8 miles and Micah's 28 miles. 8 + 28 is 36. So, together, they ran 36 miles.

Now, subtract that from the total 52 miles. 52 - 36. Let me do that subtraction. 52 minus 36. Hmm, 52 minus 30 is 22, and then minus 6 more is 16. So, 52 - 36 is 16. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total is 52. Amber is 8, Micah is 28, so 8 + 28 is 36. 52 - 36 is 16. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 52 - 8 is 44, and then 44 -28 is 16. Yeah, that also gives 16. So, that seems consistent.

So, putting it all together:

Total miles: 52

Amber ran: 8

Micah ran: 3.5 * 8 = 28

Ahito ran: 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.

1. Total miles: 52
2. Amber ran 8 miles
3. Micah ran 3.5 times 8, which is 28 miles
4. So, 8 + 28 = 36
5. 52 - 36 = 16

Yep, that all adds up. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

**Final Answer**
Ahito ran \boxed{16} miles.
</think>

Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times the miles Amber ran. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Micah's miles:
   \[
   3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Add the miles run by Amber and Micah:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:
   \[
   52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, Ahito ran \boxed{16}
