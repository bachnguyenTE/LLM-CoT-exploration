Q: The number of songs in a playlist is 300. If John has 20 such playlists, and each song is 10 hours long, how many hours will the 20 playlists last in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of songs in all 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs and there are 20 playlists, I multiply 300 by 20 to get the total number of songs.

Next, I'll calculate the total duration of all the songs by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song, which is 10 hours.

Finally, I'll add up the durations of all the songs to find the total time the 20 playlists will last.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of songs in 20 playlists:**

   Each playlist has **300 songs**.

   \[
   \text{Total number of songs} = 300 \, \text{songs/playlist} \times 20 \, \text{playlists} = 6,600 \, \text{songs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total duration of all the songs:**

   Each song is **10 hours** long.

   \[
   \text{Total duration} = 6,600 \, \text{songs} \times 10 \, \text{hours/song} = 66,000 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{66,\!000 \text{ hours}}
   \]
