Q: Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. If the computer cost $1,100, how much did one monitor cost, in dollars?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. The total cost is $2,400. Wait, no, that's probably a typo. It should be $2,400, right? Yeah, that makes more sense. So, total cost is $2,400.

He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. Hmm, so the printer was cheaper than the computer. And the computer itself cost $1,100. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me check: $1,100 is like $1,100? That seems high for a computer, but maybe it's a business computer. Anyway, moving on.

So, the computer costs $1,100. The printer cost is $400 less than that. So, printer cost is computer cost minus $400. Let me write that as an equation: Printer cost = Computer cost - $400.

So, substituting the computer cost, that would be: Printer cost = $1,100 - $4,00. Wait, hold on, the printer cost is $400 less than the computer. So, if the computer is $1,100, then the printer is $1,100 - $4,00. But wait, $1,100 minus $4,00 would be negative, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative cost for the printer. That must mean I misread the numbers.

Wait, maybe the computer cost is $1,100, which is $1,100, and the printer was $400 less. So, $1,100 minus $400 is $700. So, the printer costs $700. That makes more sense. So, let me correct that.

So, computer: $1,100

Printer: $1,100 - $400 = $700

So, now, the total cost is computer + 2 monitors + printer = $2,400.

So, substituting the known values: $1,100 + 2*(monitor cost) + $700 = $2,400.

Wait, hold on, the computer is $1,100, printer is $700, so adding those together: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

So, the total cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Therefore, 2 monitors cost $600, so one monitor costs $600 divided by 2, which is $300.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Computer: $1,100

Printer: $700

Total for computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Total spent: $2,400

So, 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Therefore, each monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

So, each monitor costs $300.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial calculations.

Computer: $1,100

Printer: $400 less than computer: $1,100 - $400 = $700

Total computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Total spent: $2,400

So, 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Each monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, the printer was $400 less, which is $400. So, $1,100 - $400 is $700. So, that's correct.

So, computer: $1,100

Printer: $700

Total computer and printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800

Total spent: $2,400

So, 2 monitors: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600

Each monitor: $600 / 2 = $300

So, each monitor is $3
