Q: Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes as cups to take to the church's charity event. At the event, she found out that her friend had brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she had brought. What's the total number of utensils brought by the two?

Okay, so Judy bought a dozen cups and twice as many dishes as cups. Hmm, let me break that down. A dozen cups means 12 cups, right? And twice as many dishes as cups would be 2 times 12, which is 24 dishes. So Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes to the church event.

Now, at the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy had brought. Wait, let me make sure I understand that correctly. Her friend brought 40 cups, which is more than Judy's 12 cups. And her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy. But wait, Judy brought 24 dishes, so 20 more would be 24 + 20, which is 44 dishes. Hmm, that seems a lot more than Judy's 24. Let me double-check that.

So, Judy bought 12 cups and 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes. So, the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend would be the sum of all these. Let me add them up step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of cups. Judy brought 12, and her friend brought 40. So, 12 + 40 equals... 52 cups in total.

Next, the total number of dishes. Judy brought 24, and her friend brought 44. So, 24 + 44 equals... 68 dishes in total.

Now, to find the total number of utensils, I need to add the total cups and total dishes together. So, 52 cups + 68 dishes equals... 120 utensils.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. So, Judy had 24 dishes, so 24 + 20 is indeed 44. So, 44 dishes. That seems correct.

And for the cups, Judy had 12, her friend had 40, so 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, no, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? No, that's not right. 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, no, 12 + 40 is 52. Wait, 12 + 40 is 51? Wait, no, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, no, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? No, that's not right. 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52? Wait, 12 + 40 is 52. Yeah, that's correct. So, 52 cups and 68 dishes? Wait, no, 24 + 44 is 68? Wait, 24 + 44 is 68. So, 52 + 68 is 120. Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Let me add 52 and 68. 50 + 60 is 110, and 2 + 8 is 10, so 111 + 10 is 121. Wait, that's 121, not 120. Wait, did I add wrong?

Wait, 52 + 68. Let's do it step by step. 50 + 60 is 110, and 2 + 8 is 10, so 110 + 10 is 120. Wait, that's 120. Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 120? Wait, 52 + 68 is 12
