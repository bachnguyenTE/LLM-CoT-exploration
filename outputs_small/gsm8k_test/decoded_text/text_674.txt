Q: Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in her backyard. It says that the bamboo grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. The question is asking, in how many days will its height be 600 inches? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent because right now, the growth rate is given in inches per day, and the current height is in feet. So, I should convert the current height from feet to inches to keep the units straight. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 20 feet would be 20 multiplied by 12 inches. Let me calculate that: 20 times 12 is... 20 times 12 is 240, and 2 times 12 is 24, so adding those together, 240 + 24 is 264 inches. Okay, so today, the bamboo is 264 inches tall.

Now, the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. So, each day, its height increases by 30 inches. The question is asking how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 660 inches. Hmm, so I think I need to figure out the difference in height between today and when it will be 660 inches, and then divide that by the daily growth rate to find the number of days.

Let me write that down. The current height is 264 inches, and the target height is 660 inches. So, the difference in height is 660 minus 264. Let me compute that: 660 minus 264. Hmm, 660 minus 200 is 462, and then minus 64 more is... 462 minus 64. Let me subtract 60 from 462, which is 402, and then subtract 4 more, which is 400 - 4? Wait, no, 462 minus 64 is 398 inches. So, the bamboo needs to grow 398 inches more to reach 660 inches.

Since it grows 30 inches each day, I can divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days. So, 398 divided by 30. Let me do that division. 30 goes into 39 once, with 30, subtract, get 9. Bring down the 8, making 98. 30 goes into 98 three times, which is 90, subtract, get 8. So, it's 13 with a remainder of 8. So, 13.266... days. Hmm, but since we can't have a fraction of a day in this context, I think we need to round up to the next whole day because even a fraction of a day would mean the bamboo hasn't quite reached the target yet.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the growth happening continuously? Or is it discrete? The problem says it grows up to 30 inches a day, so I think it's continuous growth. So, maybe it doesn't need to wait for the fraction of a day. Hmm, but in reality, growth is measured in whole days, so perhaps we need to round up to the next whole day. So, 13.266 days would be approximately 14 days. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 30 inches per day. So, 30 times 13 is 390 inches. So, 30 times 13 is 390. So, 30 times 13 is 390, which is just 2 inches more than 398. So, 13 days would give us 390 inches, which is 2 inches more than needed. So, 13 days would make it 264 + 390 = 654 inches. Wait, that's not 660. Wait, 264 + 390 is 654, which is still 18 inches short. So, 13 days is not enough. So, 14 days would be 30 times 14, which is 420 inches. So, 264 + 420 is 684 inches. Wait, that's way more than 660 inches. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let
