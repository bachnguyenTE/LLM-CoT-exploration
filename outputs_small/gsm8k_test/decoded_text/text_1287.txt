Q: In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All the sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the older brother. I need to find the total age of all these siblings. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many brothers there are. The problem says there are 2 brothers. It also mentions that one of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the older brother. So, if one brother is 12, the older brother must be twice that age, right? Let me write that down.

If the younger brother is 12, then the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24. So, the older brother is 24 years old. That makes sense because 12 is half of 24.

Now, moving on to the sisters. The problem states that all sisters are the same age, which is 16. It doesn't mention how many sisters there are, but it says there are 3 sisters. So, each sister is 16 years old.

Alright, so now I have the ages of all the siblings. Let me list them out:

- Younger brother: 12 years old
- Older brother: 24 years old
- Each sister: 16 years old (and there are 3 of them)

Now, I need to find the total age of all these siblings. That means I have to add up the ages of the two brothers and the three sisters.

Let me calculate the total age for the brothers first. The younger brother is 12, and the older brother is 24. So, adding those together: 12 + 24 = 36. So, the brothers together are 36 years old.

Next, the sisters. There are three sisters, each 16 years old. So, 3 * 16 = 48. Wait, 3 times 16 is 48? Let me check that again. 16 + 16 is 32, plus another 16 is 48. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total age for the sisters is 48 years.

Now, to find the total age of all the siblings, I need add the total age of the brothers and the total age of the sisters together. So, 36 (brothers) + 48 (sisters) = 84.

Wait, hold on, 36 plus 48. Let me do that addition again. 36 + 48. 30 + 40 is 70, and 6 + 8 is 14, so 70 +14 is 84. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total age of all these siblings is 84 years.

But let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the brothers: 12 and 24. 12 +24 is 36. That seems right. The sisters: 3 times 16 is 48. 36 +48 is 84. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "all these siblings." So, does that include all the brothers and all the sisters? Yes, because it's 2 brothers and 3 sisters. So, 2 +3=5 siblings in total. Let me just confirm the total age.

Brothers: 12 +24=36

Sisters:16*3=48

Total:36+48=84

Yes, that's correct. So, the total age is 84.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be 84.

**Final Answer**
The total age of all these siblings is \boxed{84}.
</think>

The family has 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The younger brother is 12 years old, and the older brother is twice that age, which is 24. Each sister is 16 years old. 

First, we calculate the total age of the brothers:
\[
12 + 24 = 36
\]

Next, we calculate the total age of the sisters:
\[
3 \times 16 = 48
\]

Adding the total ages of the brothers and sisters together gives:
\[
36 + 48 = 84
\]

Thus, the total age of all these siblings is \boxed{84}.
