Q: Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn’t fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Okay, so I have this problem about Maria's power bank. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park. But when she disconnected it, the power bank wasn't fully charged yet. Then, when she went to the park, her friends asked if they could charge their phones. While charging the phones, Maria noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour. 

Wait, hold on. It says "losing 9% of the total capacity each hour." Hmm, losing 9% each hour? That seems a bit odd because usually, power banks charge, not discharge. But maybe in this context, it's discharging? So, the power bank is losing charge over time, not charging. So, it's discharging at 9% per hour for the first 5 hours, and then starting to lose 7% per hour for about 3 hours. 

At the end, the charge remaining was 28%. So, we need to find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park. 

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the initial charge when she went to the park as \( Q \). 

First, for the first 5 hours, the power bank is losing 9% of its capacity each hour. So, each hour, the remaining charge is 91% of the previous hour's charge. Because if it's losing 9%, it's retaining 91% each hour. 

So, after 1 hour, it's 91% of Q. After 2 hours, it's (91%)^2 of Q, and so on. So, after t hours, the remaining charge is (0.91)^t * Q. 

So, for the first 5 hours, the remaining charge is (0.91)^5 * Q. 

Then, after 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its capacity each hour. So, similar to before, each hour, it retains 93% of the previous hour's charge. 

So, for the next 3 hours, the remaining charge is (0.93)^3 * (remaining charge after 5 hours). 

So, putting it all together, the remaining charge after 8 hours (5 + 3) is (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 * Q. 

And we know that this remaining charge is 28%, so:

(0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 * Q = 0.28

We need to solve for Q.

So, let's compute (0.91)^5 and (0.93)^3 first.

Calculating (0.91)^5:

Let me compute 0.91^2 first: 0.91 * 0.91 = 0.8281

Then, 0.8281 * 0.91: Let's compute 0.8281 * 0.9 = 0.74529, and 0.8281 * 0.01 = 0.008281, so total is 0.74529 + 0.008281 = 0.753571

Then, 0.753571 * 0.91: 0.753571 * 0.9 = 0.6782139, and 0.753571 * 0.01 = 0.00753571, so total is 0.6782139 + 0.00753571 ≈ 0.68574961

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.91^2 is 0.8281, correct.

0.8281 * 0.91: Let's compute 0.8281 * 0.9 = 0.74529, and 0.8281 * 0.01 = 0.008281, so total is 0.74529 + 0.008281 = 0.753571, correct.

Then, 0.753571 * 0.91: 0.753571 * 0.9 = 0.6782139, and 0.753571 * 0.01 = 0
