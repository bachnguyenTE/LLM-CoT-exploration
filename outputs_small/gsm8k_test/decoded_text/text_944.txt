Q: Jen is planning to sell her root crops. She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells everything, how much will she earn?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jen is planning to sell her root crops, and she has three types: yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots. She wants to know how much she'll earn if she sells everything. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much she can earn from each type of crop separately. Starting with the yams. She has 6 yams, and each one is sold at $1.5 each. Hmm, so to find the total earnings from yams, I need to multiply the number of yams by the price per yam. That would be 6 multiplied by $1.5. Let me write that down:

6 yams * $1.5 per yam = ?

Calculating that, 6 times 1 is 6, and 6 times 0.5 is 3. So, 6 + 3 is $9. So, from the yams, she can earn $9.

Next, moving on to the sweet potatoes. She has 10 of them, each costing $2. So, similar to the yams, I need to multiply the number of sweet potatoes by the price per sweet potato. That would be 10 * $2.

10 * 2 is 20. So, from the sweet potatoes, she can earn $20.

Now, onto the carrots. She has 4 carrots, each costing $1.25. Hmm, this might be a bit trickier because of the decimal. Let me think. So, 4 multiplied by $1.25. Maybe I can break it down. 4 times $1 is 4, and 4 times $0.25 is 1. So, adding those together, 4 + 1 is $5. So, from the carrots, she can earn $5.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1.25 times 4. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, right? So, 5/4 times 4 is 5. Yeah, that makes sense. So, $5 from carrots.

Now, to find the total amount she'll earn, I need to add up the earnings from each crop. So, that's $9 from yams, $20 from sweet potatoes, and $5 from carrots.

Adding them up: $9 + $20 is $29, and then $29 + $5 is $34. So, in total, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sweet potatoes. 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each. 10 times 2 is 20. Yeah, that's correct. And the carrots, 4 times 1.25 is 5. So, 9 + 20 is 29, plus 5 is 34. Yeah, that seems right.

So, I think that's it. Jen will earn a total of $34 from selling all her root crops.

**Final Answer**
Jen will earn a total of \boxed{34} dollars.

Jen is planning to sell her root crops and wants to know how much she will earn if she sells everything. 

First, we calculate the earnings from each type of crop separately:

1. **Yams**: Jen has 6 yams, each sold at $1.5 each.
   \[
   6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = 6 \times 1.5 = \$9
   \]

2. **Sweet Potatoes**: Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, each sold at $2 each.
   \[
   10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = 10 \times 2 = \$20
   \]

3. **Carrots**: Jen has 4 carrots, each sold at $1.25 each.
   \[
   4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = 4 \times 1.25 = \$5
   \]

Next, we add up the earnings from each crop to find the total amount Jen will earn:
   \[
   \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34
   \]

Thus, Jen will earn a total of \boxed{34} dollars.
