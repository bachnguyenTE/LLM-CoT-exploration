Q: There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.  One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.  Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner.  How many penguins are still left sunbathing?

Okay, so I have this problem here about penguins sunbathing, and I need to figure out how many are left after some jump out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. Then, one-third of them jump into the ocean to swim. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. The question is, how many penguins are still left sunbathing?

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to find out how many penguins jump out in total and then subtract that from the original number to find out how many are left. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of penguins is 36. So, one-third of them jump into the ocean. To find one-third of 36, I can do 36 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Then, another one-third go inside the cave. Again, one-third of 36 is 12. So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Wait, so if 12 jump into the ocean and another 12 go into the cave, that's a total of 12 penguins gone. So, 12 plus 12 is 24. So, 24 penguins have left the sunbathing area.

Now, to find out how many are left, I subtract the number that went out from the original total. So, 36 minus 24. Let me do that subtraction. 36 minus 24 is... 12. So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

Wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might make a mistake. So, 36 divided by 3 is 12, right? So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean. Then, another 12 go into the cave. So, 12 plus 12 is 24. 36 minus 24 is 12. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. One-third is 1/3, so 1/3 of 36 is 12. So, 1/3 + 1/3 is 2/3. So, 2/3 of 36 is how many? Let me calculate that. 36 times 2 is 72, divided by 3 is 24. So, 24 penguins went out. Then, 36 minus 24 is 12. So, same answer.

Wait, but hold on, is it possible that the penguins that went into the ocean and the cave are different people? Like, could one penguin be in both the ocean and the cave? But the problem doesn't mention any overlap, so I think it's safe to assume they are separate. So, 12 in the ocean and 12 in the cave, so 24 total gone, 12 left.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions of the total. So, 1/3 went out, another 1/3 went out, so 2/3 went out. So, 2/3 of 36 is 24, so 36 minus 24 is 12. So, same answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says, "One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean." So, that's one group. Then, "Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner." So, that's another group. So, these are two separate groups, so they don't overlap. So, 1/3 + 1/3 is 2/3, so 2/3 of 36 is 24, so 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are left.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 36 divided by 3 is 12, so 12 in the ocean, 12 in the cave, so 24 total gone, 12 left. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Wait, but another way to think about it is, if 1/3 jump into the ocean, that's 12, and another 1/3 go into the cave, so 12, so 24 total. So, 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are left.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 36 penguins, 1/
