Q: Carly had 80 cards, 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, and the others had the letter D. How many of the cards had the letter D on them?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Carly and her cards. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says she had 80 cards, but wait, 80 cards? Yeah, that's a lot! So, 80 cards in total. Let me write that down:

Total cards = 80

Now, the first part says that 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out how many cards that is. 

To find 2/5 of 80, I can calculate it as:

Number of A cards = (2/5) * 80

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, and 0.4 multiplied by 80. Hmm, 0.4 times 80. Let me do 0.4 * 80. 

Well, 0.4 * 80 is the same as 0.4 * 80. Let me break it down:

0.4 * 80 = (0.4 * 80) = 32. So, 32 cards have the letter A.

Okay, so A cards = 32.

Now, the next part says that 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B. Hmm, so after taking out the A cards, the remaining cards are 80 - 32. Let me compute that.

80 - 32 = 48

So, 48 cards remain. Now, 1/2 of these 48 have the letter B. So, number of B cards is:

Number of B cards = (1/2) * 48 = 24

So, B cards = 24.

Now, moving on. It says 5/8 of the rest had the letter C. Hmm, so after taking out the A and B cards, the remaining are 48 - 24 = 24. So, 24 cards left. Now, 5/8 of these have the letter C.

Number of C cards = (5/8) * 24

Let me compute that. 5 divided by 8 is 0.625, and 0.625 multiplied by 24.

Alternatively, maybe I can do it fractionally:

24 divided by 8 is 3, so 5 * 3 = 15.

So, C cards = 15.

Wait, let me check that again. 5/8 of 24 is (5/8)*24. 24 divided by 8 is 3, so 5*3 is 15. Yeah, that's correct.

So, C cards = 15.

Now, the rest had the letter D. So, after taking out A, B, and C, the remaining cards must be D.

So, let's compute how many are left.

Total cards: 80

Minus A: 32

Minus B: 24

Minus C:15

So, 80 - 32 = 48

48 -24 =24

24 -15=9

So, 9 cards have the letter D.

Wait, let me verify that. 32 +24 +15 +9 = 80? Let's add them up.

32 +24 is 56, 56 +15 is 71, 71 +9 is 80. Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, the number of D cards is 9.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

First, 2/5 of 80 is 32. Correct.

80 -32 is 48. Correct.

1/2 of 48 is 24. Correct.

24 -15 is 9. Correct.

Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to double-check.

Total cards:80

A:2/5*80=32

Remaining:80-32=48

B:1/2*48=24

Remaining after B:48-24=24

C:5/8*24=15

Remaining after C:24-15=9

So, D:9

Yes, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions.

Total cards:80

A:2/5

B:1/2 of the remaining after A

C:5/8 of the remaining after B

D: the rest.

So, let me compute the fractions step by step.
