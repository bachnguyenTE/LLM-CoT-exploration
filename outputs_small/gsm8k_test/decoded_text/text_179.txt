Q: Lloyd earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring.  He tutored 5 hours for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. How much did he earn for the first two weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks of tutoring. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour. That's straightforward. So, for each hour he tutors, he gets $10. Now, he tutored for two weeks. In the first week, he worked 5 hours, and in the second week, he worked 8 hours. I need to calculate his total earnings from these two weeks.

Hmm, let me think. Since he earns the same rate every week, I can calculate his earnings for each week separately and then add them together. That makes sense because each week is independent, right? So, for the first week, he worked 5 hours. If he makes $10 per hour, then his earnings for the first week would be 5 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. Let me write that down:

First week earnings = 5 hours * $10/hour

Calculating that, 5 times 10 is 50, so that's $50 for the first week.

Now, moving on to the second week. He worked 8 hours. Using the same rate, his earnings for the second week would be 8 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. Let me write that:

Second week earnings = 8 hours * $10/hour

Calculating that, 8 times 10 is 80, so that's $80 for the second week.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that right. 8 times 10 is indeed 80, so that's correct. So, he earned $50 in the first week and $80 in the second week.

Now, to find the total earnings for both weeks, I need to add these two amounts together. So, total earnings = first week earnings + second week earnings.

Total earnings = $50 + $80

Adding those together, 50 plus 80 is 130. So, that should be $130 in total.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 5 hours times 10 is 50, and 8 hours times 10 is 80. Adding 50 and 80 gives 130. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I could think of it as 5 plus 8 is 13, and then times 10, which is 130. That's another way to look at it, and it still gives the same result. So, that's consistent.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just two weeks of tutoring, with different numbers of hours each week, and a fixed hourly rate. So, adding the two weeks together gives the total earnings.

Just to recap:

- First week: 5 hours * $10/hour = $50
- Second week: 8 hours * $10/hour = $80
- Total: $50 + $80 = $130

Yep, that all adds up. I don't see any complications or hidden fees or anything like that. It's a simple multiplication and addition problem.

I guess another way to think about it is, since he earns $10 per hour, each hour is a chunk of $10. So, for 5 hours, it's 5 chunks of $10, which is $50. For 8 hours, it's 8 chunks of $10, which is $80. So, adding those chunks together, 5 + 8 is 13 chunks, each worth $10, so 13 * $10 is $130.

Either way, whether I think in terms of total chunks or individual hours, I end up with the same total amount. So, I'm pretty confident that the total amount he earned for the first two weeks is $130.

Wait, hold on, just a second. Did I write $130 or $130? Let me check the original problem again. It says, "How much did he earn for the first two weeks?" So, yeah, $130. But in the answer, it's written as \boxed{} with a dollar sign. So, I think I should write it as \boxed{130} but with the dollar sign. Wait, no, in the initial problem, the user wrote "How much did he earn for the first two weeks?" and the answer is to be put in a box. So, probably, the answer is $130, so in LaTeX, it would be \boxed{130} but with a dollar sign. Wait, no, actually, in the initial problem, the
