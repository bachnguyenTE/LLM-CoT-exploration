Q: A custodian has to clean a school with 80 classrooms. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?

Okay, so I have this problem here where a custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days. Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean. They work 8 hours a day. I need to figure out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total time the custodian has. They have 5 days to clean all the classrooms. Each day they work 8 hours. So, to find the total time available, I can multiply the number of days by the hours per day. That would be 5 days multiplied by 8 hours. Let me write that down:

Total time available = 5 days × 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Okay, so they have 40 hours in total to spend cleaning. Now, I need to find out how much time they actually spend cleaning. There are 80 classrooms, and each takes 15 minutes. So, the total cleaning time is 80 classrooms multiplied by 15 minutes per classroom. Let me calculate that:

Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms × 15 minutes/classroom.

Hmm, 80 times 15. Let me do that multiplication. 80 times 10 is 800, and 80 times 5 is 440. So, adding those together, 880 minutes. So, total cleaning time is 880 minutes.

But wait, the total time available is in hours, so I need to convert minutes to hours to compare them. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I can divide the total minutes by 60 to get hours.

Total cleaning time in hours = 880 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour.

Let me compute that. 880 divided by 60. Hmm, 60 goes into 880 how many times? 60 times 14 is 840, which is less than 880. 60 times 14 is 840, so 880 minus 840 is 40. So, 14 hours and 40 minutes. Wait, but I need the total time in hours as a decimal to find the percentage. So, 40 minutes is 40/60 hours, which is 2/3 of an hour, approximately 0.6667 hours. So, total cleaning time is 14.6667 hours.

Wait, let me double-check that. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 40 minutes is 40/60 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 hours. So, 14 + 0.6667 = 14.6667 hours. So, total cleaning time is approximately 14.6667 hours.

But wait, let me make sure. 880 minutes is 880/60. Let me compute that. 60 goes into 880 14 times because 14×60=840, and 880-840=40. So, 40 minutes is 40/60=2/3≈0.6667. So, 14.66667 hours. So, total cleaning time is 14.66667 hours.

So, the custodian has 40 hours total, and they spend 14.66667 hours cleaning. So, to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, I can use the formula:

Percentage = (Cleaning time / Total time) × 100.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Percentage = (14.66667 / 40) × 100.

Let me compute 14.66667 divided by 40. Let me do that division.

14.66667 ÷ 40.

Well, 40 goes into 14.66667 how many times? Let me think. 40 goes into 146 (the first two digits after decimal) 3 times because 3×40=120. Subtract 120 from 146, we get 26. Bring down the next 6, making it 266. 40 goes into 266 6 times because 6×40=240. Subtract 240 from 266, we get 26. Bring down the next 6, making it 266 again. So, this is repeating
