Okay, so Luke needs to buy fabric for new curtains, and there are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows. Hmm, let me figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each one is 35 inches wide, I can multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. So, that would be 5 multiplied by 35 inches. Let me write that down:

Total width = Number of windows × Width per window
Total width = 5 × 35 inches

Hmm, 5 times 35. Let me calculate that. 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 5 is 25, so adding those together gives 175. So, the total width is 175 inches. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 35 times 5: 35 plus 35 is 70, plus another 35 is 105, plus another 35 is 140, plus another 35 is 175. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows. So, I need to calculate twice 175 inches. That would be 2 × 175 inches. Let me compute that. 175 times 2 is 350. So, twice the total width is 350 inches. Wait, hold on, 175 times 2 is 350? Let me verify that. 100 times 2 is 200, 70 times 2 is 140, so 200 plus 140 is 360? Wait, no, that can't be right because 175 is 100 + 70 + 5, so 100×2=200, 70×2=140, 5×2=10, so 200 + 140 is 340, plus 10 is 350. Yes, that's correct. So, twice the total width is 350 inches.

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric. But wait, is that the final answer? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question says there are five windows, each 35 inches wide, and he needs fabric equal to twice the total width. So, yes, I think I did it right.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert inches to feet to see if that makes sense? Since 12 inches make a foot, 350 divided by 12 is approximately 29.1667 feet. But the question didn't specify the unit, just asked how much fabric he should buy. So, inches is fine, but maybe they want it in feet? Hmm, the question didn't specify, so I think inches is okay.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. 5 windows, each 35 inches. 5×35 is 175 inches. Twice that is 350 inches. Yeah, that seems right. So, 350 inches is the total fabric needed.

Alternatively, if I convert 350 inches to yards, since 36 inches make a yard, 350 divided by 36 is approximately 9.7222 yards. But again, the question didn't specify the unit, so inches is probably the way to go.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance that the question is asking for something else? Like, maybe the fabric is sold by the yard or something? But the question didn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume inches.

So, to recap: 5 windows × 35 inches each = 175 inches total width. Twice that is 350 inches. So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, 350 inches is the answer.

**Final Answer**
Luke should buy \boxed{350} inches of fabric.

Luke needs to buy fabric for new curtains, and there are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows.

First, we calculate the total width of all the windows:
\[
\text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} = 175 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we find the amount of
