Q: Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, and the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. How many M&Ms did Mary get total?

Okay, so Mary bought three bags of M&Ms, and I need to figure out how many she got in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, the problem says the first bag has 300 M&Ms. That's straightforward. So, Bag 1: 300 M&Ms.

Next, the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first. Hmm, so if the first bag is 300, then the second one is 300 plus 12. Let me write that out: 300 + 12. Let me calculate that. 300 plus 10 is 310, and then plus 2 more is 312. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 300 is 300, so adding 12 would be 342. Yeah, that's right. So, Bag 2 has 342 M&Ms.

Now, the third bag is a bit trickier. It says the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. The first bag had 300, so half of that would be 300 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 2 is 150. So, Bag 3 has 150 M&Ms.

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, I need to add up the M&Ms from all three bags. So, that would be Bag 1 + Bag 2 + Bag 3. Let me write that out: 300 + 342 + 150.

Let me add them step by step. First, add 300 and 342. 300 plus 342 is... 300 + 300 is 600, and then plus 42 is 642. So, 300 + 342 = 642. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 300 + 342 is actually 642? Wait, 300 + 300 is 600, and then +42 is 602. Oh, okay, I think I messed up the addition earlier. Let me correct that.

So, 300 + 342: 300 + 300 is 600, and then 0 + 42 is 42, so total is 642. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 300 + 342 is 642? Wait, 300 + 300 is 600, and then 0 + 42 is 42, so 600 + 42 is 642. Yeah, that's correct. So, 300 + 342 is 642.

Now, I need to add the third bag, which is 150. So, 642 + 150. Let me do that. 642 + 100 is 742, and then +50 is 792. So, 642 + 150 is 792.

Wait, let me check that again. 642 + 150: 600 + 100 is 700, 40 + 50 is 90, so 700 + 90 is 790? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 642 + 150: 600 + 100 is 710, 40 + 50 is 90, so 710 + 90 is 800? Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Let me try another way. 642 + 150 is 692, and then +10 more is 702. Wait, that's not right either. Maybe I should add the units place first. 2 + 5 is 7, 4 + 5 is 9, 6 + 1 is 7. So, 642 + 150 is 792. Yeah, that seems right. So, 642 + 150 is 792. So, the total is 792.

Wait, but earlier I thought 64
