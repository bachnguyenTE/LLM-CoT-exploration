Q: Ellen and her sister, Lani, went to the mall to buy presents for their mom. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. How much did they spend in all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Ellen spent. She bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5, so her total expenditure is $100 plus $5, which equals $105.

Next, I'll calculate how much Lani spent. She purchased sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total for the bathrobes is 2 multiplied by $100, which equals $200. Adding the cost of the sunglasses, Lani's total expenditure is $200 plus $30, totaling $230.

Finally, to find the combined amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, I'll add their individual totals together: $105 plus $230 equals $335.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Ellen's Purchases:**
   - **Leggings:** \$100
   - **Photo Frame:** \$5
   - **Total for Ellen:** \$100 + \$5 = **\$105**

2. **Lani's Purchases:**
   - **Sunglasses:** \$30
   - **Two Bathrobes:** 2 × \$100 = **\$200**
   - **Total for Lani:** \$200 + \$30 = **\$230**

3. **Combined Total:**
   - **Ellen's Total:** \$105
   - **Lani's Total:** \$230
   - **Total Spent Together:** \$105 + \$230 = **\$335**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{335}
