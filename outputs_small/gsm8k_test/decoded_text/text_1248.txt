Q: Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?

Okay, so Jason is a salesperson at a car dealership, and he needs to sell 15 cars to earn a bonus. Hmm, wait, the question says he needs to sell 15 cars. Let me check that again. It says, "he needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus." Yeah, that's correct. So, he needs to make 15 cars sold.

Now, he knows based on historical averages that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the dealership to look at new cars. Okay, so that's a ratio of 25 calls to 1 sale. So, 25 calls = 1 sale.

Then, he also knows that for every 2 customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car. So, that's a ratio of 2 customers = 1 sale. So, 2 customers = 1 sale.

So, the question is, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?

Alright, so let's break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many sales Jason needs to make. The problem says he needs to sell 15 cars. So, he needs 15 sales.

Now, for each sale, he needs to make 25 telephone calls. So, if he makes 25 calls, he gets 1 sale. So, to get 15 sales, he needs to make 25 calls per sale times 15 sales.

Let me write that down:

Number of telephone calls needed = Number of sales * Calls per sale

So, that would be 15 sales * 25 calls/sale.

Let me calculate that: 15 * 25. Hmm, 10*25 is 250, and 5*25 is 125, so 250 + 125 is 375. So, 375 telephone calls.

But wait, hold on. There's another part to this. For every 2 customers that come into the dealership, 1 will buy a car. So, that's a ratio of 2 customers = 1 sale.

So, if he makes 375 telephone calls, how many customers does he get?

Well, for every 25 telephone calls, he gets 1 customer. So, 25 calls = 1 customer. So, 375 calls would be how many customers?

Let me think. If 25 calls = 1 customer, then 375 calls would be 375 / 25 customers. Let me compute that: 375 divided by 25. 25 goes into 375 how many times? 25*15 is 375, so 15 customers.

So, 375 telephone calls = 15 customers.

Now, of those 15 customers, how many will buy a car? For every 2 customers, 1 buys a car. So, 15 customers would be how many sales?

So, 15 customers / 2 customers per sale. Let me compute that: 15 / 2 is 7.5.

Wait, 7.5 sales? But you can't have half a sale, right? So, does that mean he needs to make 8 sales? Because you can't have 7.5 sales, so he needs to make 8 to cover the 15 customers.

But wait, let me think again. If he makes 375 telephone calls, he gets 15 customers. And 15 customers would lead to 7.5 sales. But since you can't have half a sale, he needs to make 8 sales to cover all 15 customers.

But wait, is that correct? Because 8 sales would require 8*25=200 telephone calls, which would get him 8 sales, but he only needs 15. So, he might not need to make 200 calls, but 375 calls would get him 15 customers, which would get him 7.5 sales, but since you can't have half a sale, he needs to make 8 sales, which would require 8*25=200 telephone calls, but he only needs 375.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me approach it differently.

Perhaps, instead of trying to compute the number of sales first, I should compute the number of telephone calls needed to get 15 sales, considering both the customer acquisition and the conversion rates.

So, first, to get 15 sales, he needs 15 sales. Each sale requires 25 telephone calls, so 15
