Q: Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Tasha making money from two jobs: selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Last month, she made a total of $80. The question is asking how much she made from lemonade sales. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the information given. Tasha made $80 in total. That's the sum of her earnings from lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, if I can find out how much she made from mowing lawns, I can subtract that from the total to find out how much she made from lemonade.

The problem also mentions two weeks: the first week and the following week. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. It also says that Joe paid her $6 for her work. So, Joe's work is a separate job, and he paid her $6. That means Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns.

Wait, so Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns. So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, if Joe did, say, x times, then Kamala did 3x times. Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's, so that would be 5x times.

But wait, is Joe's work the same as the mowing lawns? Or is Joe's work separate? The problem says Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so I think Joe's work is separate. So, Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns. So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, Joe's work is $6, so in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, if Joe did x times, then Kamala did 3x times.

Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's. So, Joe did x times, so Alba's lawn was 5x times.

Wait, but Joe's work is $6, so is that the total he did? Or is it per week? Hmm, the problem says Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. So, I think that's the total he did, so in both weeks, Joe did x times, so total for both weeks, Joe did 2x times. But wait, no, the problem says "the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's." So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. So, Joe's work is separate, so Joe's work is $6, and in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Is Joe's work the same as the mowing lawns? Or is Joe's work separate? The problem says "she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's." So, Joe's work is separate, so Joe's work is $6, and in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, Joe's work is $6, so in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, if Joe did x times, then Kamala did 3x times.

Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's. So, Joe did x times, so Alba's lawn was 5x times.

But wait, Joe's work is $6, so is that the total he did? Or is it per week? The problem says "Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work." So, I think that's the total he did, so in both weeks, Joe did x times, so total for both weeks, Joe did 2x times, but the total he paid is $6. So, maybe Joe's work is $6, so in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, so if Joe did x times, then Kamala did 3x times. So, total for the first week, Joe did x times, and Kamala did 3x times. So, total work done by Joe and Kamala in the first week is x + 3x =
