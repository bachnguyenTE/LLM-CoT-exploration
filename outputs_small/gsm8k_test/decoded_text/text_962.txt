Okay, so Jen is going to three different countries, and he needs to pay $400 in supplies. Hmm, that's straightforward. Now, the question is about the travel cost, which is 50% more than the supplies. Wait, 50% more? So, I need to figure out what 50% of $440 is and then add that to the original $440 to get the total travel cost. Let me think about how to calculate that.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The total cost for supplies is $400. The travel cost is 50% more than that. So, I need to calculate 50% of $400 and then add it to $440 to get the total travel cost. Is that right? Or is it 50% more than the total cost, which would be 1.5 times the supplies? Wait, the wording says "50% more than the supplies." So, it's 50% of the supplies added to the supplies. So, yes, that would be 1.5 times the supplies.

Let me write that down. The total travel cost is 1.5 times the supplies. So, 1.5 multiplied by $440. Let me compute that. 1.5 times 440. Hmm, 1 times 440 is 440, and 0.5 times 440 is 220. So, adding those together, 440 + 220 is 660. Wait, that can't be right because 1.5 times 440 is 660. But wait, 1.5 times 440 is 660? Let me check that again.

Wait, 440 divided by 2 is 220, so 1.5 times 440 is 440 + 220, which is 660. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the total travel cost is $660. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, the problem says "50% more than the supplies." So, 50% more than $440. So, 50% of 440 is 220, so adding that to 440 gives 660. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total travel cost is $660.

Wait, but hold on, the total cost for supplies is $440, right? So, 50% more than that is 440 + 220 = 660. So, that's the travel cost. So, the answer is $660.

But let me think again. Is the total cost for travel 50% more than the supplies, which is $440? So, 50% of 440 is 220, so 440 + 220 is 660. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total travel cost is $660.

Wait, but the problem says "the tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies." So, that's 50% more than the supplies, which is $440. So, 50% of 440 is 220, so 440 + 220 is 660. So, yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it had said "50% more than the total cost," that would be different, but it's 50% more than the supplies. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't misread the question. It says, "the tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies." So, the total travel cost is 50% more than the supplies. So, yes, 50% of 440 is 220, so 440 + 220 is 660. So, the total travel cost is $660.

Wait, but hold on, is the total cost for travel 50% more than the supplies, or is the total cost for travel 50% more than the supplies? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies." So, the tickets for travel cost is 50% more than the supplies. So, yes, 50% more than 440 is 660.
