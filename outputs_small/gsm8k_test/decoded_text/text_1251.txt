Q: It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides.  How long does the Rubik's cube take?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Rubik's cube times, and I need to figure out how long it takes to get all six sides. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

It says, "It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. The second and third sides each take twice that long. The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides. How long does the Rubik's cube take?"

Hmm, okay. So, let me parse this sentence by sentence.

First, it takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side. So, that's straightforward: 5 minutes.

Then, the second and third sides each take twice that long. So, if the first side is 5 minutes, the second and third sides are each 2 times 5 minutes. Let me calculate that: 2 * 5 = 10 minutes. So, the second and third sides each take 10 minutes.

Next, it says the last 2 sides each take half as long as the first. So, the first side is 5 minutes, so half of that is 2.5 minutes. So, each of the last two sides takes 2.5 minutes.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "the last 2 sides each take half as long as the first." So, does that mean each of the last two sides is half the time of the first? So, yes, 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes each.

So, summarizing:

1st side: 5 minutes

2nd side: 10 minutes

3rd side:10 minutes

4th side: ?

5th side: ?

6th side: ?

Wait, the problem says, "the last 2 sides each take half as long as the first." So, does that mean the 4th and 5th sides each take half as long as the first? Or does it mean the 5th and 6th sides?

Wait, let me read it again: "The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides."

Hmm, so it's saying that the last two sides (which would be sides 5 and 6) each take half as long as the first side. So, sides 5 and 6 each take 2.5 minutes.

But then, it also says, "once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides." So, does that mean that after getting the 5th side, you have all 6? So, perhaps the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that completes it? So, maybe the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that takes half as long as the first.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it again.

It says: "The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides."

So, the last two sides (which would be sides 5 and 6) each take half as long as the first side. So, sides 5 and 6 take 2.5 minutes each.

But then, it also says, "once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides." So, does that mean that after getting the 5th side, you have all 6? So, perhaps the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that completes it. So, maybe the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that takes half as long as the first.

Wait, but the problem says "the last 2 sides each take half as long as the first." So, if the last two sides are sides 5 and 6, each taking half as long as the first, which is 2.5 minutes.

But then, the problem also says, "once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides." So, perhaps the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that completes it. So, maybe the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that takes half as long as the first.

Wait, but that would mean that the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that completes it. So, perhaps the 5th side is the last one, and the 6th side is the one that takes half as long as the first.

Wait, but the problem says "the last
