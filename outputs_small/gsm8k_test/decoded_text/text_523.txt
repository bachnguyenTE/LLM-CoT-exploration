Q: The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the Beverly Hills Bakery. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the bakers baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. Hmm, wait, 220? That seems like a lot. Let me double-check. Yeah, 220 is correct. So, they baked 220 loaves on the morning of Monday.

Then, they sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. So, I need to subtract the sold loaves from the total baked to find out how many are left. After that, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, I need to add those back to the remaining loaves.

Let me write this down to visualize it better.

Starting with 220 loaves.

Subtract the morning sales: 220 - 93.

Let me calculate that. 220 minus 93. Hmm, 220 minus 90 is 125, and then minus 3 more is 122. So, after the morning sales, they have 122 loaves left.

Then, in the afternoon, they sold 39 loaves. So, subtract 39 from 122.

122 minus 39. Let me do this step by step. 122 minus 30 is 112, and then minus 9 more is 103. So, after the afternoon sales, they have 103 loaves left.

Now, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, I need to add those back to the remaining 103.

103 plus 6 is 109. So, the total number of loaves left is 109.

Wait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

220 loaves baked.

Subtract 93 sold in the morning: 220 - 93 = 127? Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 122, but now I'm getting 127. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait, 220 minus 93. Let me do it another way. 220 minus 90 is 130, and then minus 3 is 127. Oh, okay, so it's 127, not 122. I must have messed up my subtraction earlier.

So, 220 - 93 is 127. Then, subtracting the afternoon sales of 39: 127 - 39.

127 minus 30 is 97, then minus 9 more is 88. So, after the afternoon sales, they have 88 loaves left.

Then, the grocery store returned 6 loaves. So, 88 + 6 is 94.

Wait, so now I'm getting 94 as the final answer. Hmm, so which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in my initial subtraction?

Let me check 220 - 93 again. 220 minus 90 is 130, and then minus 3 is 127. So, that's correct. Then, 127 - 39. 127 minus 30 is 97, minus 9 is 88. Then, 88 +6 is 94. So, 94 is the final answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 103, but that was a mistake. So, the correct answer is 94.

Let me just go through the problem again to make sure.

Baked 220 on Monday morning.

Sold 93 in the morning: 220 -93=127.

Sold 39 in the afternoon: 127 -39=88.

Grocery store returned 6: 88 +6=94.

Yes, that seems right. So, the answer is 94.

I think I initially made a mistake in my subtraction, but upon rechecking, it's 94. So, the correct answer is 94.

**Final Answer**
The bakery had \boxed{94} loaves of bread left.
