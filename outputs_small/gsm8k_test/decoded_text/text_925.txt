Q: There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Anthony and his father filling a water tank, and then using it to water their garden. I need to figure out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are 10,0000 gallons of water in a pool. Wait, hold on, that seems like a typo. 10,000 is probably supposed to be 10,000, which is 10,000 gallons. Let me confirm: 10,000 is 10,000, which is 10 thousand and 00 gallons? Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's 10,000, which is 10 thousand and 00 gallons? Wait, that still doesn't add up. Maybe it's 10,000, which is 10 thousand and 00 gallons? Hmm, I'm confused. Let me think.

Wait, 10,000 gallons is 10,000 gallons. So, 10,000 gallons. That's 10 thousand and 00 gallons. So, 10,000 gallons. Okay, that makes sense. So, the pool has 10,000 gallons of water. Then, Anthony and his father use a water pump to fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. So, half of 10,000 gallons is... let me calculate that. Half of 10,000 is 5,500 gallons. So, the tank has 5,500 gallons of water.

Then, they use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, every day, 500 gallons are taken out. The question is, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?

Alright, so let's outline the steps:

1. Start with 10,000 gallons in the pool.
2. Fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. So, 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons. Wait, hold on, the problem says half the amount of water in the pool. So, is it half of 10,000, which is 5,000 gallons? Or is it half of the water in the pool, which is 10,000 gallons, so 5,000 gallons. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, but the problem says "half the amount of water in the pool." Hmm, "amount" is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's half of the water in the pool, which is 10,000 gallons, so 5,000 gallons. So, the tank has 5,000 gallons.

Then, they use water from the tank to water their garden. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, every day, 500 gallons are taken out. So, over 6 days, how much water is used?

So, total water used in 6 days is 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons.

Therefore, the remaining water in the tank is initial amount minus water used. So, 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check. The pool has 10,000 gallons. They fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. So, half of 10,000 is 5,000. So, tank has 5,000 gallons. Then, they use 500 gallons per day. So, over 6 days, 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons used. So, 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons remaining.

Wait, but 5,000 - 3,000 is 2,000. So, 2,000 gallons remaining.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. The pool has 10,000 gallons. They fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. So, half of 10,000 is 5,000. So, tank has 5,000 gallons. Then, they use 50
