Q: Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, if there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, how many kilograms does she gave to her cousin and brother?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. I need to find out how many kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother combined. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out how many kilograms are in each sack. The problem says there are 25 kilograms per sack. So, each sack is 25 kg. That makes sense.

Now, Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin. So, to find out how many kilograms that is, I need to multiply the number of sacks by the kilograms per sack. That would be 3 sacks multiplied by 25 kg per sack. Let me write that down: 3 * 25. Hmm, 3 times 25 is 15. Wait, no, that can't be right. 3 times 25 is actually 15? Wait, no, 3 times 25 is 15? Wait, no, 3 times 25 is 75. Wait, no, 3 times 25 is 75. Wait, no, 25 times 3 is 75? Wait, no, 25 times 3 is 75? Wait, no, 25 times 3 is 75. Yeah, that's right. So, 3 sacks give her 75 kilograms.

Then, she gave 4 sacks to her brother. So, similar to before, I need to multiply 4 by 25. Let me calculate that: 4 * 25. Hmm, 4 times 25 is 100. So, 4 sacks give her 100 kilograms.

Now, to find the total kilograms she gave to her cousin and brother, I need to add those two amounts together. So, 75 kilograms plus 100 kilograms. Let me add those: 75 + 100 is 175. So, 75 + 100 is 175. So, altogether, she gave away 175 kilograms of rice.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3 sacks times 25 kg is 75, and 4 times 25 is 100. 75 plus 100 is 175. Yeah, that seems right. So, the total rice given to her cousin and brother is 175 kilograms.

I think that's it. So, the answer should be 175 kilograms.

**Final Answer**
The total kilograms of rice given to her cousin and brother is \boxed{175}.

Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice, with each sack containing 25 kilograms of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

First, we calculate the kilograms of rice given to her cousin:
\[
3 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack} = 75 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate the kilograms of rice given to her brother:
\[
4 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack} = 100 \text{ kg}
\]

To find the total kilograms of rice given to her cousin and brother, we add the two amounts together:
\[
75 \text{ kg} + 100 \text{ kg} = 175 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total kilograms of rice given to her cousin and brother is \boxed{175}.
