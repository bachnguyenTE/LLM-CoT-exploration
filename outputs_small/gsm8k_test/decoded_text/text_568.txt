Q: Three teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 80 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three teenagers playing soccer. It says that Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. And we know that Richie scored 80 goals. The question is asking how many goals all three teenagers scored in total.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's figure out how many goals Mark scored. The problem says Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Wait, 20 is a typo, right? It should probably be 20, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's supposed to be 20 more goals? Or maybe it's 20 more goals than Mark? Wait, no, 20 is a number, so maybe it's 20 more goals than Mark. But 20 is 20, which is 20 goals? That seems a bit odd. Maybe it's 20 more goals than Mark, meaning 20 more than Mark's goals. So, if Mark scored M goals, then Richie scored M + 20. But wait, the problem says Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so that would be M + 20. But the problem also says that Mark scored 20 fewer goals than Richie. Wait, no, the problem says "Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark." So, if Mark scored M, then Richie scored M + 20. And we know that Mark scored 20 fewer goals than Mark? Wait, no, the problem says "Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna." So, Mark is 20 less than Mark? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, Mark is 20 less than Mark? That can't be. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, let me read it again: "Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna." So, that means:

Richie = Mark + 20

Richie = Anna + 45

So, Mark is 20 less than Richie, and Anna is 45 less than Richie. So, if we know that Richie scored 80 goals, then Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. And Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. So, Mark scored 60, Anna scored 35, and Richie scored 80. So, total goals would be 60 + 35 +80.

Wait, let me check that again. If Richie scored 80, and she scored 20 more than Mark, then Mark must have scored 80 -20 =60. And she scored 45 more than Anna, so Anna scored 80 -45=35. So, adding them up: 60 +35 is 95, plus 80 is 175. So, total goals are 175.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if Mark scored 60, then Richie is 20 more, which is 80, which matches the given. And Anna is 45 less than Richie, so 80 -45=35. So, yeah, that seems correct. So, total goals: 60 +35 +80=175.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna." So, that's two separate statements. So, Mark is 20 less than Richie, and Anna is 45 less than Richie. So, if Richie is 80, then Mark is 60, Anna is 35. So, 60 +35 +80=175. So, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure that the problem didn't say something else. It says "three teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna." So, yeah, that's two separate comparisons. So, Mark is 20 less than Richie, and Anna is 45 less than Richie. So, that's correct.

So, Mark: 80 -20=60

Anna:80 -45=35

Richie:80

Total:60+35+80=175.

Wait, but 60 +35 is 95, plus 80 is
