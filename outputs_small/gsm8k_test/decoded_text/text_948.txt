Q: Cayley markets various newspapers to get a commission on each copy sold. He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Cayley selling newspapers and earning a commission. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, first, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets a commission on each copy. Specifically, he gets 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. The question is asking how much commission he will earn in total from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and each copy of Wall Street Journal costs $15.

Wait, hold on, the problem says he sells 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal? That seems like a typo. It should probably be 10 copies, right? Because 10 is a more reasonable number for a problem like this. So, I'll go with 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal.

Alright, so let me break this down. First, I need to calculate the commission from the New York Times and then the commission from Wall Street Journal separately, and then add them together for the total commission.

Starting with the New York Times. He sells 6 copies, each costing $5. So, the total sales from the New York Times would be 6 multiplied by $5. Let me write that down:

Total sales from New York Times = 6 * $5.

Calculating that, 6 times 5 is 30. So, $30 from the New York Times.

Now, Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, for each copy, he earns 10% of $5. Let me compute that:

Commission per copy of New York Times = 10% of $5.

10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form, so:

0.10 * $5 = $0.50.

So, for each copy, he makes $0.500. Since he sold 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 multiplied by $0.50.

Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50.

Calculating that, 6 times 0.5 is 3. So, $3.00 commission from the New York Times.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 copies, each costing $15. So, the total sales from Wall Street Journal would be 10 multiplied by $15.

Total sales from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $15.

Calculating that, 10 times 15 is 150. So, $150 from Wall Street Journal.

Now, he gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, for each copy, his commission is 8% of $15. Let me compute that:

Commission per copy of Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15.

Again, 8% is 0.08 in decimal form, so:

0.08 * $15 = $1.20.

So, for each copy, he makes $1.20. Since he sold 10 copies, the total commission from Wall Street Journal is 10 multiplied by $1.20.

Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20.

Calculating that, 10 times 1.2 is 12. So, $12.00 commission from Wall Street Journal.

Now, to find the total commission Cayley earns, I need to add the commission from the New York Times and the commission from Wall Street Journal together.

Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00.

Adding those together, 3.00 + 12.00 is 15.00.

So, $15.00 in total commission.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, New York Times: 6 copies at $5 each. 6*5=30. Correct. 10% commission on each, so 0.10*5=0.50 per copy. 6*0.50=3.00. That seems right.

Then, Wall Street Journal: 10 copies at $15 each. 10*15=150. 8% commission on each, so 0.08*15=1.20 per copy.
