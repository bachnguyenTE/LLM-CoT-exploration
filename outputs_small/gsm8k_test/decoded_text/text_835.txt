Q: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?

Okay, so I have this problem here: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. We have kangaroos and turtles traveling across a highway. The key information is that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Then, we need to find out how long it would take 4 turtles, each moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do the same trip.

Let me break this down. Maybe I should start by figuring out the total distance of the highway because that seems like a common starting point for these kinds of problems. If I can find the distance, then I can figure out the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then determine the time it takes for the turtles to cover that distance.

So, let's denote the distance of the highway as D. Since all three entities—kangaroos, turtles, and the highway—are moving at constant speeds, I can use the basic formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time, or D = speed × time.

Given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, I can write the equation for the distance as:

D = (speed of one kangaroo) × 18 hours.

But wait, the problem says the kangaroos are traveling at the same speed. So, each kangaroo has the same speed. Let me denote the speed of a kangaroo as Vk. So, the distance D is equal to 18 hours multiplied by Vk.

So, D = 18 × Vk.

Now, I need to find out how long it will take the turtles to cover the same distance D. The turtles are each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of a turtle, let's denote it as Vt, is Vt = (1/2) × Vk.

So, each turtle's speed is half that of a kangaroo. Now, we have 4 turtles, each moving at Vt. So, the combined speed of the 4 turtles would be 4 × Vt, right? Because if each turtle is moving at Vt, then four of them would be moving at 4Vt.

So, the total speed of the turtles is 4 × (1/2) × Vk. Let me compute that: 4 × (1/2) is 2. So, the combined speed of the turtles is 2 × Vk.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the combined speed of the 4 turtles is 2 times the speed of a single kangaroo. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me think. If each turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, then four of them would be 2 times the speed of a single kangaroo. So, yeah, that makes sense.

So, the combined speed of the turtles is 2 × Vk. Now, we can use the distance formula again, but this time for the turtles. The distance D is the same as before, which is 18 × Vk. The speed of the turtles is 2 × Vk. So, the time it takes for the turtles to cover distance D is time = distance / speed.

So, time = D / (2 × Vk). But we know that D is 18 × Vk, so substituting that in, we get:

time = (18 × Vk) / (2 × Vk).

Wait, let me compute that. The Vk in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, right? So, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, the time is 9 hours.

Wait, so it takes 9 hours for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I found the distance D as 18 hours multiplied by the speed of a kangaroo, which is correct because 3 kangaroos take 18 hours. Then, I found the speed of the turtles as half of the kangaroo's speed, so each turtle is moving slower. Then, I calculated the combined speed of 4 turtles as 4 times half the kangaroo's speed, which is 2 times the kangaroo's speed. That seems right because 4 times 0.5 is 2.

Then, using the distance formula again, I plugged in the distance D as 18 times the kangaroo's speed, and the combined speed as 2 times the kangaroo's speed, which cancels out the kangaroo's speed, leaving
