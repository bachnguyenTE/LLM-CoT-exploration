Q: Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?

Okay, so Russell is ordering bagels, and I need to figure out how much each single bagel will cost. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels. Russell is ordering 4 packs. Hmm, so I should calculate the total cost for 4 packs before any discount. 

Each pack is $10.00, so 4 packs would be 4 times $10.00. Let me write that out: 4 * $10.00. That should be $40.00. So, the total cost before any discount is $40.00.

But wait, he gets a 10% discount. So, I need to calculate 10% of $40.00 and subtract that from the total. Let me make sure I have the numbers right. 10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form. So, 0.10 * $40.00. Hmm, let me compute that.

First, 10% of 40 is 0.10 * 40.00. Let me do the multiplication: 0.10 * 40.00. Well, 0.10 is the same as 11 cents, and 40 is 40 dollars. So, 11 cents times 40 dollars. Wait, maybe I should convert this into dollars to make it easier.

Wait, 10% of $40.00 is 0.10 * 40.00. Let me compute 0.10 * 40.00. So, 0.10 * 40 is 4.40, and 0.10 * 0.00 is 0.00. So, total discount is $4.40. So, the total cost after discount is $40.00 - $4.40 = $35.60.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. 10% of 40 is 4, so 40 - 4 is 36. So, why did I get 35.60? Maybe I made a mistake in the decimal places.

Wait, 10% of 40 is 4, so 40 - 4 is 36. So, the total cost after discount is $36.00. Hmm, so I think I messed up the multiplication earlier. Let me try that again.

10% of 40 is 4, so 40 - 4 = 36. So, the total cost after discount is $36.00. That makes more sense. So, the total cost is $36.00.

Now, he ordered 4 packs, each containing 9 bagels. So, the total number of bagels is 4 * 9 = 36 bagels. So, he's getting 36 bagels for $36.00.

Wait, so each bagel would be 36 divided by 36, which is $1.00 per bagel. That seems too straightforward. But let me make sure.

Wait, 4 packs, each with 9 bagels, so 4*9=36 bagels. 36 divided by 36 is indeed 1. So, each bagel is $1.00. But that seems like a lot, considering the discount. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the discount calculation.

Wait, let me go back. Each pack is $10.00, 4 packs is $40.00. 10% discount on $40.00 is 0.10 * 40.00. Let me compute that again.

0.10 * 40.00. So, 0.10 * 40 is 4.00, and 0.10 * 0.00 is 0.00. So, total discount is 4.00. So, 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00. So, the total cost is $36.00.

So, 36 bagels for $36.00. So, each bagel is 36 / 36 = 1.00. So, each bagel is $1.00. Hmm, that seems correct, but it's a bit expensive. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the problem again. Each pack is $
