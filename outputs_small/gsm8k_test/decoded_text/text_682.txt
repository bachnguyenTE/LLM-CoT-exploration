Q: Shania is designing her own dress, and decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?

Okay, so Shania is making a longer dress, and she's extending it by 50% of its original length. Hmm, that means she's adding more fabric to the dress. Then, she adds 20 cm to the bottom with a lace trim. After all that, the total length of the dress is 140 cm. I need to find out how long the dress was originally.

Let me think. Let's call the original length of the dress "x" centimeters. So, if she extends it by 50% of its original length, that would be 0.5 times x, right? So, the extended part is 0.5x cm.

Then, she adds 20 cm with a lace trim. So, the total length is the original plus the extended part plus the 20 cm. So, that would be x + 0.5x + 20 cm.

And we know that this total is 140 cm. So, putting that together, the equation is:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Let me write that down:

x + 0.5x + 20 = 140

Now, let's combine like terms. x is the same as 1x, so 1x + 0.5x is 1.5x. So, the equation becomes:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Now, I need to solve for x. So, first, subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with x.

1.5x + 20 - 20 = 140 - 20

Which simplifies to:

1.5x = 120

Okay, so now I have 1.5x equals 120. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 1.5.

x = 120 / 1.5

Hmm, let me compute that. 120 divided by 1.5. Well, 1.5 goes into 120 how many times? Let me think.

1.5 times 80 is 120 because 1.5 times 10 is 15, so 1.5 times 80 is 120. So, 120 divided by 1.5 is 80.

So, x is 80 cm.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the original dress was 80 cm, then extending it by 50% would be 0.5 times 80, which is 40 cm. So, 80 + 40 is 120 cm. Then, adding 20 cm gives 140 cm, which matches the total given. So, that seems correct.

So, the original dress was 80 cm long.

**Final Answer**
The original dress was \boxed{80} centimeters long.
</think>

Let \( x \) be the original length of the dress in centimeters. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which is \( 0.5x \) cm. She also adds 20 cm with a lace trim. The total length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can set up the equation:

\[
x + 0.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
1.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

\[
1.5x = 120
\]

Dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[
x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
\]

Thus, the original dress was \(\boxed{80}\) centimeters long.
