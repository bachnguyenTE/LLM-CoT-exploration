Q: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John buying red and blue ties. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can handle it.

First, the problem says John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Hmm, so if he buys some number of blue ties, the number of red ties is double that. Let me write that down. Let me denote the number of blue ties as B. Then, the number of red ties would be 2B. That makes sense.

Next, it says the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Wait, 50% more? That's a bit confusing because usually, we say 50%, but in the problem, it's written as 50%. Maybe that's a typo? I think it should probably be 50%, but just in case, I'll keep it as 50% for now. So, if blue ties cost, let's see, $40 each, and red ties are 50% more expensive. So, red tie cost is 1.5 times the blue tie cost. Let me confirm that: 50% more than $40 is $40 + 50% of $40. 50% of 40 is 0.55*40, which is 22, so 40 + 22 is 62. So, red ties cost $62 each. Wait, that seems a bit expensive, but okay, maybe it's correct.

He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. So, how many blue ties did he buy? Let me calculate that. If each blue tie is $40 and he spent $200, then the number of blue ties is total spent divided by cost per tie. So, 200 divided by 40. Let me do that division: 200 ÷ 40. 40 goes into 200 five times because 40*5=200. So, he bought 5 blue ties. That seems manageable.

Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2*5=10 red ties. So, 10 red ties.

Now, each red tie costs $62, as I calculated earlier. So, the total cost for red ties is number of red ties times the cost per red tie. So, 10*62. Let me compute that: 10*60 is 600, and 10*2 is 20, so 600 + 20 is 620. So, red ties cost $620.

He spent $200 on blue ties and $620 on red ties. So, total amount he spent is 200 + 620. Let me add that up: 200 + 600 is 800, and 800 + 20 is 820. So, total spent is $820.

Wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, blue ties: 5 ties at $40 each is 5*40=200, that's correct. Red ties: twice as many, so 10 ties. Each red tie is 50% more expensive than blue tie. So, blue tie is $40, 50% more is 40 + 20=60. So, red tie is $60 each. 10 red ties would be 10*60=660. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought red tie was $62, but now I'm getting $66. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me recalculate the red tie cost. If blue tie is $40, 50% more is 40 + (0.5*40)=40 +22=66. So, red tie is $66 each. So, 10 red ties would be 10*66=660. So, that's $660 for red ties. So, total spent is 200 + 660=860. Wait, that's different from before. So, which one is correct?

Wait, the problem says red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. So, 50% more than $40. So, 50% of 40 is 22, so 40 +22=62. So, red tie is $62 each. So,
