Q: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Russell distributing straw in a pet store. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem says that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Then, there are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There's also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. It mentions that no straw is used elsewhere, and that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. The question is asking how many rats are in each cage.

Alright, let me break this down. So, the main goal is to find the number of rats per cage. Let's denote the number of rats per cage as 'r'. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, that means each cage has 'r' rats. 

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, for each cage, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats would be 6 pieces per rat multiplied by the number of rats in that cage, which is 'r'. So, per cage, the straw given is 6r pieces.

Since there are 3 cages, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats would be 3 times 6r, which is 18r. So, total straw for rats is 18r.

Wait, but the problem says that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Hmm, hold on, the problem says 160 pieces, but in my calculation, I have 18r. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check again. It says, "the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw." So, each rat gets 6 pieces. So, if there are 3 cages, each with 'r' rats, then total number of rats is 3r. So, each rat gets 6 pieces, so total straw for rats is 3r * 6 = 18r. So, 18r pieces of straw.

But the problem says that 160 pieces have been distributed among the small rodents. So, 18r = 160? That would mean r = 160 / 18 = 20. So, 20 rats per cage? That seems high, but let me see.

Wait, but hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?"

Wait, so the problem says that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. So, that's the total for the rats. So, 18r = 160, so r = 160 / 18. Wait, 160 divided by 18 is approximately 9. So, 9.444... which is not a whole number. Hmm, that's a problem because you can't have a fraction of a rat in a cage.

Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 160 pieces are the total for the rats, but maybe the 10 cages of hamsters and the pen of rabbits are separate. So, the 160 pieces are only for the rats. So, 18r = 160, so r = 160 / 18, which is 8.888... which is still not a whole number. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I misread the number of cages. Let me check again. It says, "There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw." So, 10 cages, each with some number of hamsters. Each hamster is given 5 pieces. So, if there are 10 cages, each with some number of hamsters, but the number of hamsters per cage is not given. Similarly, the pen of rabbits has 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits. So, 20 pieces for rabbits
