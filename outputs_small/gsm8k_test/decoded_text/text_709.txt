Q: An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about an ice cream factory that makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. Hmm, so I need to find out how much chocolate ice cream they make per hour. To do that, I can divide the total quarts by the time taken. So, 100 quarts divided by 2 hours. Let me calculate that: 100 ÷ 2 is 50. So, they make 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream each hour. Got that.

Next, the problem mentions that they also make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. I need to find out the rate for vanilla as well. So, similar to before, I'll divide the total quarts by the time. That's 50 quarts divided by 4 hours. Let me do that division: 50 ÷ 4 is 13.75. Hmm, that's 13.75 quarts per hour. I can also write that as a fraction, which is 50/4 or 13 3/4 quarts per hour. Okay, so that's the rate for vanilla.

Now, the question is asking how many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours. So, I need to calculate the total production for both chocolate and vanilla in 48 hours and then add them together.

Starting with chocolate: they make 50 quarts per hour. So, in 48 hours, that would be 50 quarts/hour multiplied by 48 hours. Let me compute that: 50 * 48. Hmm, 50 times 40 is 220, and 55 times 8 is 440. Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I should break it down differently. 50 times 40 is 2000, and 50 times 8 is 440. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Maybe I should just do 50 * 48. 50 times 4 is 200, and 50 times 8 is 400. So, 200 + 400 is 600. So, 50 * 48 is 600. So, 50 quarts per hour times 48 hours is 600 quarts. That seems right.

Now, for vanilla: they make 13.75 quarts per hour. So, in 48 hours, that would be 13.75 quarts/hour multiplied by 48 hours. Let me calculate that. 13.75 times 48. Hmm, 13 times 48 is 524, and 0.75 times 48 is 36. So, adding those together, 524 + 36 is 560. So, 13.75 * 48 is 560 quarts. That seems correct.

Now, to find the total quarts made in 48 hours, I need to add the chocolate and vanilla totals together. So, 600 quarts (chocolate) plus 560 quarts (vanilla) equals 1160 quarts. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For chocolate: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours. 50 * 48. Let me do 50 * 40 = 2000, and 55 * 8 = 440. Wait, no, that's not right. 50 * 48 is the same as 50 * 48. Let me compute 50 * 48. 50 * 40 is 2200, and 55 * 8 is 440. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 50 * 48 is 2000, and 50 * 40 is 2000. Wait, no, that's not correct. Maybe I should do 50 * 48 as (50 * 40) + (55 * 8). Wait, 50 * 40 is 2200, and 55 * 8 is 440. So, 2200 + 440 is 2640. Wait, that's not right because 50
