Q: Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the dinosaur picnic. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Ted is planning to bring potato salad for both adults and children. An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. Ted wants to make sure there's enough for everyone, so I need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required.

Alright, let's start by figuring out how much one child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs, a child should eat 10 lbs divided by 2. Let me write that down:

Child's consumption = 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.

So, each child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad. Now, Ted has 5 children coming to the picnic. To find the total amount of potato salad needed for the children, I can multiply the child's consumption by the number of children.

Total for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Okay, so the children will need 25 lbs of potato salad. Now, moving on to the adults. There are 22 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs. So, the total for the adults would be:

Total for adults = 22 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 220 lbs.

Wait, hold on, the problem says 20 adults and 5 children. Let me double-check that. It says 20 adults and 5 children. So, 22 is correct. So, 22 adults times 10 lbs each is indeed 220 lbs.

Now, to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, I should add the total for the adults and the total for the children together.

Total potato salad needed = 220 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 245 lbs.

Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, 22 adults times 10 is 220, and 5 children times 5 is 25. 220 plus 25 is 245. That seems right.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "adults and children" at the picnic. It doesn't specify if there are any other people or if Ted is bringing it for himself. But the problem says Ted is bringing potato salad for the picnic, so I think we're only considering the adults and children. So, 22 adults and 5 children.

So, 22*10 is 220, 5*5 is 25, 220+25 is 245. So, Ted needs to bring 245 lbs of potato salad.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance that Ted is bringing it for himself? The problem says he's bringing it to the picnic, so maybe it's for everyone, including himself. But the problem doesn't mention Ted as an adult or child, so I think it's just for the adults and children. So, 22 adults and 5 children.

So, 22*10 is 220, 5*5 is 25, total is 245. So, 245 lbs.

Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says "Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic." So, it's for the entire picnic, which includes the adults and children. So, yes, 22 adults and 5 children.

So, 22*10 is 220, 5*5 is 25, 220+25 is 245. So, Ted needs to bring 245 lbs.

Wait, but hold on, 22*10 is 220, 5*5 is 25, so 220+25 is 245. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. 22 adults, each eating 10 lbs. So, 22*10 is 220, 22*10 is 220. 5 children, each eating 5 lbs, so 5*5 is 25. 220+25 is 245. So, 245 lbs.

Wait, but 22*10 is 220, 5*5 is 25, so 220+25 is 245.
