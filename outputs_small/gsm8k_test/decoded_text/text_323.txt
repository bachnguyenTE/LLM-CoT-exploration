Q: Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?

Okay, so I have this problem about Shannon making iced coffee. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Shannon brews hot coffee and then adds ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Also, any added liquid weakens the coffee. The question is asking how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, the coffee is being cooled by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees. So, how many ice cubes does she need to cool it by 65 degrees? 

Let me calculate that. If each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees, then the number of ice cubes needed would be 65 divided by 13. Let me do that: 65 ÷ 13 is 5. So, she needs 5 ice cubes. 

Wait, but each ice cube also makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, each ice cube adds 12 ml of weakness. So, 5 ice cubes would add 5 times 12 ml. Let me compute that: 5 * 12 is 60. So, 60 milliliters weaker from the ice cubes.

But wait, the question also mentions that any added liquid weakens the coffee. She adds 15 milliliters of cream. So, does that mean the cream also contributes to the weakness? 

I think so. So, the cream is an additional liquid that weakens the coffee. So, the cream adds 15 milliliters of weakness. 

So, now, the total weakness would be the sum of the ice cubes' effect and the cream's effect. That is, 65 degrees cooling requires 5 ice cubes, each adding 12 ml, so 5*12=60 ml, plus 15 ml from the cream. So, 60 +15=75 milliliters weaker.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, each ice cube cools by 13 degrees and weakens by 12 ml. So, 5 ice cubes would cool by 5*13=15 degrees, but the question says cooled by 65 degrees. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, hold on.

Wait, the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees. So, 65 divided by 13 is 5. So, 5 ice cubes. So, each ice cube also weakens the coffee by 12 ml. So, 5 ice cubes would cause 5*12=60 ml of weakness. Then, she adds 15 ml of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, 60 +15=75 ml. So, total weakness is 75 ml.

Wait, but hold on, the question says "how many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?" So, the cooling is 65 degrees, which is the total cooling, and the cream is 15 ml. So, the total weakness is 65 degrees cooling (which is 5 ice cubes) and 15 ml cream. So, 5 ice cubes cause 5*12=60 ml, and 15 ml cream is 15 ml. So, total is 60+15=75? Wait, 60+15 is 75? Wait, 60+15 is 75. Wait, 60+15 is 75. So, 75 ml weaker.

Wait, but hold on, the question says "how many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?" So, the cooling is 65 degrees, which is 5 ice cubes, each causing 12 ml, so 5*12=60, plus 15 ice cubes? Wait, no, each ice cube is 13 degrees, so 65/13=5 ice cubes. So, 5 ice cubes, each causing 12 ml, so 5*12=60, plus 15 ml cream? Wait, no, 15 ml cream. So, 60+15=75. So, 75 ml weaker.

Wait, but hold on, the question says
