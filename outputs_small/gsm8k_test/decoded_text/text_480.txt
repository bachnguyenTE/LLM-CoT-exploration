Q: Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. How many tubes of paint does Jasper have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ben and Jasper with tubes of paint. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. So, Ben's total paint is blue plus yellow. That part seems straightforward. But then it goes on to talk about Jasper's paint. It says Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total.

Let me break it down. Let's start with Ben's blue paint. Ben has 4 tubes. Jasper has half as many blue tubes as Ben. So, if Ben has 4, half of that would be... let me calculate that. Half of 4 is 2. So, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint. That part seems simple enough.

Now, moving on to the yellow paint. Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many yellow tubes as Ben. So, three times 3 is... 9. So, Jasper has 9 tubes of yellow paint. That makes sense.

Now, to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, I need to add up his blue and yellow paints. So, that would be 2 blue tubes plus 9 yellow tubes. Let me add those together. 2 plus 9 is 11. So, does that mean Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total?

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Ben has 4 blue and 3 yellow. Jasper has half the blue, which is 4 divided by 2, so 2. And three times the yellow, which is 3 times 3, so 9. Then, 2 plus 9 is 11. Yeah, that seems right.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a chance I misread the problem? It says "half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben" and "three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben." So, yes, that translates to half of Ben's blue and three times Ben's yellow. So, 4 divided by 2 is 2, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 2 plus 9 is 11. So, 11 is the total number of tubes.

Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe, but I don't think so. It seems pretty straightforward. So, I think 11 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Sometimes, when problems say "half as many," it could be interpreted differently, but in this case, it's pretty clear. If Ben has 4 blue, half is 2. If Ben has 3 yellow, three times is 9. So, 2 plus 9 is 11. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the answer is 11.

**Final Answer**
Jasper has a total of \boxed{11} tubes of paint.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.

1. Ben's blue paint: 4 tubes.
2. Jasper's blue paint: Half of Ben's blue paint is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes.
3. Ben's yellow paint: 3 tubes.
4. Jasper's yellow paint: Three times Ben's yellow paint is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes.
5. Total tubes of paint Jasper has: \( 2 + 9 = 11 \) tubes.

Thus, Jasper has a total of \boxed{11} tubes of paint.
