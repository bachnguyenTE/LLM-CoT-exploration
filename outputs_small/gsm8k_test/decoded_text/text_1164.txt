Q: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  And Mei finds half as many as Charlie.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cole hiding eggs for the Easter egg hunt. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Hmm, a dozen is 12, so 3 dozen would be 3 times 12. Let me write that down:

3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

Alright, so Cole hid 36 eggs. Now, the next part says Lamar finds 5 eggs. That's straightforward. So, Lamar has 5 eggs. Then, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. Hmm, twice as many means 2 times the number Lamar found. So, if Lamar has 5, Stacy has 2 ×5. Let me calculate that:

Stacy = 2 ×5 = 10 eggs.

Wait, 2 times 5 is 10? No, that's 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? No, that's 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10? Wait, no, 2 times 5 is 10. Yeah, that's right. So, Stacy has 10 eggs.

Okay, moving on. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, if Stacy has 10, then Charlie has 10 minus 2. Let me write that:

Charlie = Stacy -2 =10 -2=8 eggs.

So, Charlie finds 8 eggs. Then, Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, half of 8 is 4. So, Mei has 4 eggs.

Let me recap:

- Cole: 36 eggs
- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

Now, to find out how many eggs are still hidden, I need to subtract the total number of eggs found by all the people from the original number of eggs hidden by Cole.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36. Then, the others found some eggs. So, the total eggs found are the sum of all the eggs found by each person.

So, let's calculate the total eggs found:

 Cole: 36

Lamar:5

Stacy:10

Charlie:8

Mei:4

So, adding them up: 36 +5=41, 41+10=51, 51+8=59, 59+4=63.

So, total eggs found are 63.

But wait, the original number of eggs was 36, right? Because Cole hid 3 dozen, which is 36. So, if 63 eggs have been found, but only 36 were hidden, that doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. And Mei finds half as many as Charlie. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?"

Wait, so Cole hid 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs. Then, the
