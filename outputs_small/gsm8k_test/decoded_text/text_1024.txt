Q: Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. How much money does she have left from her earnings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate the total earnings from selling cookies. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so that's 80 dollars.

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, which amounts to 240 dollars.

Add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings: 88 + 240 = 328 dollars.

Suzanne gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so she gave away a total of $20.

Finally, subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money she has left: 328 - 20 = 308 dollars.

**Solution:**

Let's break down Suzanne's earnings step by step.

1. **Earnings from Cookies:**
   - Number of cookies sold: 80
   - Price per cookie: \$1
   - Total earnings from cookies: \( 80 \times \$1 = \$80 \)

2. **Earnings from Cupcakes:**
   - Number of cupcakes sold: 60
   - Price per cupcake: \$4
   - Total earnings from cupcakes: \( 60 \times \$4 = \$240 \)

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes: \( \$80 + \$240 = \$328 \)

4. **Amount Given to Sisters:**
   - Suzanne gave \$10 to each of her two sisters.
   - Total amount given: \( 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \)

5. **Money Left:**
   - Money left after giving to sisters: \( \$328 - \$20 = \$308 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{308}
