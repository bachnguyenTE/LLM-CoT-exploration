Q: Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will be Janeth's remaining balance by then?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. That means she's going to pay back more than she borrowed. Then, she's going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. I need to figure out how much she'll have left to pay after those 12 months. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the total amount she needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10%. So, I think that means she's paying back 10% interest on the $2000. Wait, no, actually, the problem says "an additional 10% of the amount." So, that would be 10% on $2000. Let me calculate that.

10% of $2000 is... well, 10% is the same as 0.10, so 0.10 multiplied by 2000. Let me do that: 2000 * 0.10 = 2000 * 0.1 = 200. So, that's $200. So, she needs to return the original $2000 plus an extra $200, which totals $4200. Wait, no, hold on. Is that right?

Wait, no, actually, if she borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%, that means she's paying back 110% of the $2000. So, 110% of 2000. Let me calculate that. 2000 * 1.10. Hmm, 2000 *1 is 2000, and 2000*0.10 is 200, so 2000 + 200 is 2200. So, she needs to pay back $2200 in total. Got it.

So, she's borrowing $2000 and has to pay back $22200. Now, she's going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. So, let me figure out how much she's going to pay in total over the 12 months. That would be 165 multiplied by 12. Let me compute that: 165 * 2 is 330. So, she's going to pay a total of $330 over 12 months.

Now, the question is asking for her remaining balance after those 12 months. So, she borrowed $2000, but she's going to pay back $330. So, the remaining balance would be the amount she borrowed minus the amount she's going to pay back. So, that would be 2000 - 330. Let me compute that: 2000 - 300 is 1700, and then subtract another 30, so 1700 - 30 is 1667. So, is her remaining balance $1667?

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations. So, she borrowed $2000, and she's paying back 110% of that, which is $2200. Then, she's paying $165 per month for 12 months, so 165*12. Let me compute that again: 165*10 is 1650, and 165*2 is 330, so 1650 + 330 is 1980. Wait, so she's paying back $1980 over 12 months, not $330. So, that changes things.

So, she borrowed $2000, and she's paying back $1980 in total. So, her remaining balance is 2000 - 1980. Let me compute that: 2000 - 1980. Hmm, 2000 - 1900 is 100, and then subtract another 80, so 100 - 80 is 20. So, 1000 - 80 is 1020? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 2000 - 1980 is 20. Wait, 1980 is 19
