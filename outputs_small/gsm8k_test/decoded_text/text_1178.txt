Q: Mike bought 5 face masks while Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. How many face masks did Johnny buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many face masks Johnny bought. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

"Mike bought 5 face masks while Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. How many face masks did Johnny buy?"

Alright, so Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought more than that, specifically 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out what "thrice as many as Mike" means. If Mike bought 5 masks, then thrice as many would be 3 times 5. Let me write that down:

3 * 5 = 15

So, Johnny bought 15 more masks than that. But wait, the problem says Johnny bought 2 more than that amount. So, I need to add 2 to the 15 I just calculated.

15 + 2 = 17

So, does that mean Johnny bought 17 face masks? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Mike bought 5 masks. Thrice as many would be 3*5=15. Then, 2 more than that is 15+2=17. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, let me think again. Sometimes, when problems say "more than," it's easy to misinterpret. So, "Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike." So, the structure is: thrice as many as Mike, then add 2. So, yes, 3*5=15, then 15+2=17. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as an equation, let me represent the number of masks Johnny bought as J. Then, according to the problem:

J = 3 * (number of masks Mike bought) + 2

Since Mike bought 5, that would be:

J = 3*5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

So, that's another way to look at it, and it still gives me 17. So, that seems consistent.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward once you break it down. Sometimes, when problems are worded in a certain way, it's easy to misinterpret, but in this case, it seems pretty clear.

Just to make sure, let me visualize it. If Mike has 5 masks, and Johnny has three times that, which is 15, and then he adds 2 more, so 15+2=17. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of variables, let me define:

Let M = number of masks Mike bought = 5

Let J = number of masks Johnny bought

According to the problem, J = 3*M + 2

Substituting M with 5:

J = 3*5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

So, that's another way to represent it, and it still gives me the same answer.

I think I'm confident that the answer is 17. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem that would lead to a different result. It's pretty straightforward once you parse the words correctly.

So, to recap:

1. Mike bought 5 masks.
2. Johnny bought 3 times as many as Mike: 3*5=15.
3. Then, Johnny bought 2 more than that: 15+2=17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

**Final Answer**
Johnny bought \boxed{17} face masks.
</think>

Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

First, we calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add 2 more to this amount:
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Thus, Johnny bought \boxed{17} face masks.
