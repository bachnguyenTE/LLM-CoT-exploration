Q: Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. If he uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 red of his shoeboxes to go fishing, how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the initial number of shoe boxes Tim has. He has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes, making a total of 16 shoe boxes.

Next, I'll calculate how many shoe boxes he uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 1/3 of the red shoe boxes. Since there are 9 red shoe boxes, using 1/3 of them means he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Subtracting the used shoe boxes from the initial count, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes remaining in his box.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shoe boxes Tim has left after his fishing trip.

**Given:**
- **Blue shoe boxes:** 7
- **Red shoe boxes:** 9
- **Shoe boxes used for fishing:**
  - **Blue shoe boxes:** 3
  - **Red shoe boxes:** \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 9

**Step 1: Calculate the number of red shoe boxes used.**

\[
\text{Red shoe boxes used} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of blue shoe boxes remaining.**

\[
\text{Blue shoe boxes remaining} = 7 - 3 = 4
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of red shoe boxes remaining.**

\[
\text{Red shoe boxes remaining} = 9 - 3 = 6
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}}
\]
