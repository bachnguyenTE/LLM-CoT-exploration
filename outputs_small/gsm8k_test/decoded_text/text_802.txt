Q: Bubbles collects stuffed animals. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras and four stuffed frogs. If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?

Okay, so I have this problem where Bubbles collects stuffed animals, and she wants to buy some stuffed goats. The goal is to make sure that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has three stuffed puppies, five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras, and four stuffed frogs. So, let me add those up:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14 stuffed animals in total.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 3 plus 5 is 8, plus 2 is 10, plus 4 is 14. Yeah, that's correct. So, she has 14 stuffed animals right now.

Now, she wants to buy some stuffed goats. Let me denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as G. After buying these goats, the total number of stuffed animals she has will be her current total plus the goats she buys. So, the new total will be 14 + G.

The problem says that the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30%. So, the goats should make up 30% of the total stuffed animals. Let me write that as an equation.

The percentage of goats is equal to the number of goats divided by the total number of stuffed animals, multiplied by 100%. So, mathematically, that's:

(G / (14 + G)) * 100% = 30%

Hmm, okay. So, I can set up the equation as:

(G / (14 + G)) = 0.30

Because 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form.

So, now I can solve for G. Let me write that equation again:

G / (14 + G) = 0.30

To solve for G, I can cross-multiply. So, multiply both sides by (14 + G):

G = 0.30 * (14 + G)

Let me compute the right side:

0.30 * 14 is 1.2, and 0.30 * G is 0.30G. So, the equation becomes:

G = 1.2 + 0.30G

Now, I need to get all the G terms on one side. Let me subtract 0.30G from both sides:

G - 0.30G = 1.2

Which simplifies to:

0.70G = 1.2

Now, to solve for G, I can divide both sides by 0.70:

G = 1.2 / 0.70

Let me compute that. 1.2 divided by 0.70. Hmm, 0.70 goes into 1.2 how many times?

Well, 0.70 times 1 is 0.70, subtract that from 1.2, you get 0.50. Then, 0.70 goes into 0.50 about 0.7 times (since 0.70*0.7=0.49). So, 1.2 / 0.70 is approximately 1.647.

Wait, let me do this more accurately. 1.2 divided by 0.70.

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimals:

12 / 7.0

Hmm, 7.0 goes into 12 once, with a remainder of 5.0. Then, 7.0 goes into 5.0 about 0.7 times (since 7.0*0.7=4.9). So, 1.7 times 7.0 is 12. So, 12 / 7.0 is 1.647 approximately.

So, G is approximately 1.647. But since she can't buy a fraction of a stuffed goat, she needs to buy a whole number. So, she needs to round up to the next whole number because 1.647 is less than 2, but she needs at least 30% of the total to be goats.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. If she buys 1.647 stuffed goats, but she can't buy a fraction, so she needs to round up to 2. But let me check if 2 is enough.

Wait, let me plug G=2 back into the original equation to see if it makes sense.
