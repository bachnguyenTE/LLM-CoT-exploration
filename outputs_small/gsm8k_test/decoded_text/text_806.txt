Q: Janet is collecting the results of Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, along with 40 out of 100 fourth graders. The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate. What is the school's overall pass rate?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of students who passed in each grade category.

For the third-graders, 340 out of 500 passed.

For the fourth-graders, 40 out of 100 passed.

For the fifth-graders, the pass rate was twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 passed, the pass rate for fourth-graders is 44%. Therefore, the pass rate for fifth-graders is 88%.

Next, I'll calculate the number of fifth-graders who passed by applying the pass rate to the total number of fifth-graders.

Finally, I'll sum the number of students who passed across all three grades and divide by the total number of students to find the overall pass rate.

To determine the school's overall pass rate, let's break down the information step by step.

### 1. Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- **Third-Graders:**
  - Total students: 500
  - Pass rate: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
  - Number of students who passed: \( 500 \times 0.68 = 340 \)

- **Fourth-Graders:**
  - Total students: 100
  - Pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
  - Number of students who passed: \( 100 \times 0.4 = 40 \)

- **Fifth-Graders:**
  - Pass rate: Twice that of fourth-graders.
  - Pass rate for fourth-graders: 40%
  - Pass rate for fifth-graders: \( 2 \times 40\% = 80\% \)
  - Total students: 400
  - Number of students who passed: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

### 2. Calculate the total number of students who passed:

\[
\text{Total passed} = 340 \ (\text{third-graders}) + 40 \ (\text{fourth-graders}) + 320 \ (\text{fifth-graders}) = 700
\]

### 3. Calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} = \frac{700}{400 + 500 + 100} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7 \text{ or } 70\%
\]

\[
\boxed{70\%}
\]
