Q: Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.

Okay, so Carrie has ten twenties and 140 quarters. She wants to use all the quarters and three-fifths of the twenties for lunch. I need to figure out how much money she spent in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much the quarters are worth. Each quarter is worth $0.25, right? So, if she has 140 quarters, I can multiply 140 by $0.25 to get the total amount she spent on the quarters. Let me write that out:

140 quarters * $0.25 per quarter.

Hmm, 140 times 0.25. I know that 100 quarters make $25, so 140 quarters would be 140 quarters plus 4 quarters. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, 100 quarters make $25, so 140 quarters would be 140 divided by 20, which is 7. So, 7 times $25 is $175. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.

Wait, 10 quarters make $2.50, so 140 quarters would be 140 divided by 2.5. Hmm, maybe I should do it another way. 140 divided by 2 is 70, so 70 times $2.50. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Maybe I should just multiply 140 by 0.25 directly.

140 * 0.25. Let me think. 140 * 0.25 is the same as 140 divided by 4, because 0.25 is 1/4. So, 140 divided by 4 is 35. So, 140 quarters equal $35. Okay, that makes sense because 4 quarters make a dollar, so 140 divided by 4 is 35. So, she spent $35 on the quarters.

Alright, now onto the twenties. She spent three-fifths of the twenties. She has ten twenties, so three-fifths of 10 is... Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 5 is 2, so 2 times 3 is 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. Each twenty is $20, so 6 twenties would be 6 times $20. So, 6 * 20 is $120. So, she spent $120 on the twenties.

Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. If she spent three-fifths of the twenties, that's 3/5 of 10, which is 6. So, 6 twenties is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that's correct. So, she spent $120 on the twenties.

Now, to find the total amount she spent, I need to add the money she spent on the quarters and the twenties. So, $35 plus $120. Let me add those together. 35 + 120 is 155. So, the total amount she spent is $155.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 140 quarters is $35, and 6 twenties is $120. 35 + 120 is indeed 155. So, yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 140 quarters is $35, and 10 twenties is $220, so 10 twenties minus 3/5 of 10 twenties is 10 - 6 = 4 twenties, which is 4 * 20 = $80. So, total spent is $35 + $80 = $115. Wait, that's different. Hmm, did I do something wrong here?

Wait, no, hold on. If she spent three-fifths of the twenties, that's 6 twenties, so she spent 6 twenties, which is $120, and the remaining 4 twenties, which is $80. So, total spent is $35 + $120 = $155. So, that's consistent with the first method.

Wait, but in my second method, I thought of 10 twenties as $220, but that's incorrect because 10 twenties is 10 * 20 = $200, not $220. So, that was a mistake. So, 10 twenties is $20
