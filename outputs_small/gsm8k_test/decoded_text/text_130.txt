Okay, so I have this problem here where Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. Then, a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. After that, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. The question is asking how many elves are left. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, Nissa starts with 60 elves. That part seems straightforward. Now, the first thing that happens is a third of the elves quit because of children vomiting on them. So, I need to calculate a third of 60. Let me write that down:

Number of elves who quit first = (1/3) * 60

Calculating that, 66 divided by 3 is 22. So, 22 elves quit after the children vomit. That means the number of elves remaining after this first quit is:

Remaining elves after first quit = 66 - 22 = 44

Okay, so now there are 44 elves left. Then, the next part is that 10 of the remaining elves quit because kids kick their shins. Wait, hold on, 10? That seems a bit confusing. Is that 10 elves or 10 elves? Because 10 seems too low, but maybe it's a typo. Let me check the original problem again.

"A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins."

Hmm, so it's 10, not 10. So, 10 elves quit after the kids kick their shins. So, let's subtract that from the remaining 44.

Number of elves who quit second = 10

Remaining elves after second quit = 44 - 10 = 34

So, that would mean 34 elves are left. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 66 elves. A third is 22, so 66 -22 is 44. Then, 10 quit, so 44 -10 is 34. That seems right.

Wait, but 10 is a small number, so maybe I should think about whether the problem is saying 10% or 10 elves. But in the problem, it's written as 10, so I think it's 10 elves, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 100? Or maybe 10? Hmm, but 10 is a small number, so 10 elves would leave 34, which is a lot.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the problem is written incorrectly. It says "10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins." So, 10 is the number, not 10 elves. So, 10 is the number, so 10 elves quit, leaving 34. So, 34 is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as 10, which is 10, so 10 elves. Then, 66 -22 is 44, 44 -10 is 34. So, same result.

Wait, but 10 is a small number, so 34 is the number of elves left. Hmm, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as 10, which is 10, so 10 elves. So, 66 -22 is 44, 44 -10 is 34. So, 34 is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as 10, which is 10, so 10 elves. Then, 66 -22 is 44, 44 -11 is 43. But that seems less likely because 10 is a more reasonable number.

Wait, but in the problem, it's written as 10, so I think it's 10 elves. So, 10 is the number, so 10 elves. So, 66 -22 is 44, 44 -10 is 34.

So, 34 is the number of elves left.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem is written as 10, which is 10, so 10 elves. So, 66 -22 is 44, 44 -10 is 34. So, 34 is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as 10, which is 10,
