Q: A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Octavia and Juan drinking coffee. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Hmm, I think "stickler" here means someone who is very particular about their health, so maybe they have a strict diet or something. Anyway, the key point is that Octavia drinks half the daily recommendation. 

Then it says Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. But Juan’s husband, Octavia, drinks half of that. So, I need to figure out how much Juan needs to reduce his intake from whatever he was drinking to 4 cups, considering that he drinks twice as much as Octavia.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the daily recommendation as R cups. So, according to the problem, Octavia drinks half of R, which is (1/2)R. Then, Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks, so that would be 10*(1/2)R, which is 5R. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again.

Wait, the problem says Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks. So if Octavia drinks (1/2)R, then Juan drinks 10*(1/2)R, which is indeed 5R. But then the doctor says Juan needs to reduce his intake to 4 cups. So, currently, Juan is drinking 5R, but he needs to go down to 4 cups. So, the reduction needed is 5R - 4 cups.

But wait, the question is asking by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. So, it's 5R - 4. But I don't know what R is. Is R given somewhere? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the daily recommendation R. Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me read it again.

"A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?"

Wait, so the daily recommendation is 4 cups? Because Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, R is 4 cups. So, Octavia drinks half of that, which is 2 cups. Then Juan drinks 10 times that, which is 20 cups. But the doctor wants him to reduce it to 4 cups. So, he needs to reduce from 20 to 4 cups. So, the reduction is 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure. So, if the daily recommendation is 4 cups, then:

- Octavia drinks half of that, so 2 cups.
- Juan drinks 10 times that, so 20 cups.
- The doctor wants Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups.
- So, the reduction needed is 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

But wait, that seems like a lot. Is that correct? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the daily recommendation is not 4 cups, but something else. Wait, the problem says Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, that must mean that the daily recommendation is 4 cups. So, R = 4.

Therefore, Octavia drinks half of that, which is 2 cups. Juan drinks 10 times that, which is 20 cups. But the doctor wants him to reduce it to 4 cups. So, he needs to reduce from 20 cups to 4 cups, which is a reduction of 16 cups.

Wait, but 16 cups a day? That seems like a lot. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?"

So, the key points are:

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommendation.
2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks.
3. Juan's doctor wants him to reduce his intake to the daily recommendation, which is 4 cups.

So, if the daily recommendation is 4 cups, then:

- Octavia drinks 2 cups.
- Juan drinks 2
