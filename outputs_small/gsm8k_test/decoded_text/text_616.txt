Q: Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Jane's beanstalk. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that after the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. Then, it doubled in height the second week. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. I need to find out how tall the beanstalk was after three weeks.

Alright, let's break it down week by week. First week is straightforward: it's 3 inches tall. So, after week one, height is 3 inches. Got that.

Now, the second week is where it doubles in height. So, if it was 3 inches at the end of week one, doubling that would mean 3 times 2, right? Let me calculate that. 3 times 2 is 6. So, after week two, the beanstalk is 6 inches tall. That makes sense because it doubled from the previous week.

Moving on to the third week, it says it grew another 4 inches. Hmm, so does that mean it added 4 inches to the previous week's height, or does it mean it doubled again? Wait, the wording says "it grew another 4 inches," which sounds like it's adding 4 inches to whatever it was at the end of the second week. So, if it was 6 inches at the end of week two, adding 4 inches would make it 10 inches tall at the end of week three.

Let me just make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Sometimes, in word problems, "doubled" can be a bit ambiguous. It could mean it became twice as tall as before, or it could mean it added the same height as the previous week. But in this case, the problem says it "doubled in height the second week," which sounds like it was doubling from the previous week's height, not adding the same amount. So, that would mean it was 3 inches, then doubled to 6 inches, and then in the third week, it grew another 4 inches, making it 10 inches total.

Wait, but let me think again. If it was 3 inches at the end of week one, and then it doubled in height the second week, that would mean it became 6 inches. So, the second week's growth is 3 inches, making it 6 inches. Then, in the third week, it grows another 4 inches, so 6 plus 4 is 10 inches. That seems right.

Alternatively, if it had doubled again, meaning from 6 inches to 12 inches, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says it grew another 4 inches, not doubled. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.

So, summarizing:

- Week 1: 3 inches
- Week 2: 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches
- Week 3: 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

Therefore, after three weeks, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall.

Wait, just to double-check, is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe the growth in the third week is 4 inches, not adding to the previous week's height. So, starting from 3 inches, doubling to 6 inches, then adding 4 inches, which is 10 inches. Yeah, that still comes out to 10 inches.

Alternatively, if the growth in the third week was another 4 inches, meaning it's 4 inches taller than the previous week, but that would be a different interpretation. But the problem says "it grew another 4 inches," which sounds like it's adding 4 inches to whatever it was at the end of the second week. So, that would be 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

I think that's the correct way to interpret it. So, I'm confident that the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after three weeks.

**Final Answer**
The beanstalk was \boxed{10} inches tall after three weeks.

Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week, and in the third week, it grew another 4 inches. 

- After the first week: 3 inches.
- After the second week: The height doubled from the first week, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- After the third week: The height grew another 4 inches, so \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches.

Thus, the height of the beanstalk after three weeks is \(\boxed{10}\) inches.
