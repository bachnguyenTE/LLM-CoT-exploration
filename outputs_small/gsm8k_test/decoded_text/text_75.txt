Q: Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level below is half the size of the one above it. The top level is 16 square feet. I need to find the average square footage of each level. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the sandcastle. It has 4 levels, with each subsequent level being half the size of the one above. So, starting from the top, the first level is 16 square feet. Then the next level down would be half of that, which is 8, right? Then the third level would be half of 8, which is 4, and the bottom level would be half of 4, which is 2. So, the square footage for each level is 16, 8, 4, and 2.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If each level is half the square footage of the level above, then yes, starting from 16, the next is 8, then 4, then 2. So, the four levels are 16, 8, 4, 2.

Now, to find the average square footage, I need to add up all the square footage and then divide by the number of levels, which is 4. So, let me add them up.

16 + 8 is 24, plus 4 is 28, plus 2 is 30. Wait, 16 + 8 is 24, 24 + 4 is 28, 28 + 2 is 30. So, the total square footage is 30.

Wait, hold on, 16 + 8 is 24, 24 + 4 is 28, 28 + 2 is 30. Yeah, 30 total square feet across all four levels.

So, the average would be 30 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 4 is 7.5. So, the average square footage per level is 7.5.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 16, 8, 4, 2. Adding them up: 16 + 8 is 24, 24 + 4 is 28, 28 + 2 is 30. Yeah, that's correct. 30 total.

Divide by 4 levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5. So, 7.5 square feet on average per level.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using a formula or something. Since each level is half the previous, this is a geometric sequence where the first term is 16, and the common ratio is 1/2, with 4 terms.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = a1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). So, plugging in the values: a1 is 16, r is 1/2, n is 4.

So, S_4 = 16*(1 - (1/2)^4)/(1 - 1/2). Let's compute that.

First, (1/2)^4 is 1/16. So, 1 - 1/16 is 5/6.

Then, 1 - 1/2 is 1/2.

So, S_4 = 16*(5/6)/(1/2). Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2, so 16*(5/6)*2.

Simplify that: 16*(5/6)*2. Let's compute 16*2 first, which is 12. So, 12*(5/6). 12 divided by 6 is 2, so 2*5 is 10. Wait, that's 10? But earlier, I got 30. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check.

Wait, the formula is S_n = a1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). So, plugging in, 16*(1 - (1/2)^4)/(1 - 1/2). So, 1 - (1/16) is 15/16, and 1 - 1/2 is 1/2. So, 16*(15/6)/(1/2) is 16*(15/6)*2. So, 16*2 is 12, 12*(5/6) is 10. Wait, that's 1
