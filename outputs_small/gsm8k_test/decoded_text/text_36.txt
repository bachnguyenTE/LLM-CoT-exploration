Q: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Terry spends on buy yogurt over 30 days. Let me see, he eats 2 yogurt a day. Hmm, that means in 30 days, he'll eat 2 times 30, right? Let me calculate that. 2 times 30 is 60. So, Terry eats 60 yogurt in 30 days. 

Now, the yogurt are on sale: 4 for $5.00. Hmm, so I need to find out how many sets of 4 he can buy in 30 days. Since he eats 2 a day, over 30 days, he needs 60 yogurt. So, how many groups of 4 can I make from 60? Let me divide 60 by 4. 4 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 2, so that's 1 group of 4 and 2 left over. Wait, no, that's not right. 4 times 15 is 60. Oh, wait, 4 times 15 is 60. So, he can buy 15 sets of 4 yogurt. 

Each set is $5.00, so 15 times 5.00. Let me compute that. 10 times 5.00 is 5.00, and 5 times 5.00 is 25.00. So, adding those together, 5.00 + 25.00 is 30.00. So, Terry spends $33.00 on yogurt over 30 days. 

Wait, let me double-check. 2 yogurt a day for 30 days is 60 yogurt. On sale, 4 for $5.00. So, 60 divided by 4 is 15. So, 15 times 5.00 is 33.00. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is $33.00. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. 4 times 15 is 60, so yes, 15 sets. Each set is $5.00, so 15 times 5.00 is 33.00. Yeah, that's correct. So, Terry spends $33.00 on yogurt over 30 days. 

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer should be $33.00.

Terry eats 2 yogurt a day, so over 30 days, he consumes 2 × 30 = 60 yogurt. The sale offers 4 yogurt for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 he can buy, divide 60 by 4, which gives 15 sets. Each set costs $5.00, so 15 × $5.00 = $33.00. 

**Answer:** Terry spends $33.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
