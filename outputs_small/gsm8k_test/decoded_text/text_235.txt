A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so John is ordering pizzas to share with his 20 friends, and he wants each friend to have 4 slices. The pizzas are sold in slices, each pizza being cut into 8 portions. Hmm, I need to figure out how many pizzas John needs to order to have enough slices for everyone.

First, let me break down the problem. There are 20 friends, and each friend gets 4 slices. So, the total number of slices needed is 20 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down:

Total slices needed = Number of friends × Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 × 4

Calculating that, 20 times 4 is 80. So, John needs 80 slices in total.

Now, each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. So, each pizza gives 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas he needs, I should divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.

Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed ÷ Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas needed = 80 ÷ 8

Let me compute that. 80 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 10 is 80, so 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, John needs 10 pizzas.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each pizza is 8 slices, and he needs 80 slices, then 80 divided by 8 is indeed 10. So, 10 pizzas would give exactly 80 slices, which is just 8 slices short of what he needs. But wait, that can't be right because 10 pizzas would give 80 slices, but he needs 80 slices. So, that's actually 8 slices less than needed. Hmm, that seems like a problem.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate the total slices needed. 20 friends times 4 slices each is 80 slices. So, 80 slices. Each pizza is 8 slices. So, 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, 10 pizzas would give exactly 80 slices, which is 8 slices less than needed. So, that's a problem because John needs 80 slices, but 10 pizzas only give 80. So, he needs 1 more pizza to get the remaining 8 slices.

Wait, so 10 pizzas give 80 slices, which is 8 slices short. So, he needs 1 more pizza, which would give him 8 more slices, totaling 88 slices. But he only needs 80. So, that's 8 slices more than needed. Hmm, but is that acceptable? Or does he need to have enough slices, even if it's a little extra?

The problem says John wants to make sure each can have 4 slices. So, he needs at least 80 slices. So, 10 pizzas give exactly 80 slices, which is exactly what he needs. So, 10 pizzas is sufficient. So, maybe my initial thought was correct.

Wait, but 10 pizzas would give 80 slices, which is exactly 80, which is the number needed. So, 10 pizzas is sufficient. So, why did I think it was 11 pizzas? Maybe I confused the numbers.

Wait, 20 friends, each with 4 slices: 20 × 4 = 80. Each pizza is 8 slices. So, 80 ÷ 8 = 10. So, 10 pizzas. So, 10 pizzas give exactly 80 slices, which is exactly what he needs. So, 10 pizzas is sufficient.

Wait, but 10 pizzas is 80 slices, which is 8 slices short. So, 10 pizzas is insufficient because he needs 80. So, 11 pizzas is 8 slices, which is not enough. So, 10 pizzas is 80 slices, which is exactly what he needs. So, 10 pizzas is insufficient, 11 pizzas is insufficient, 10 pizzas is insufficient, 10 pizzas is exactly what he needs. So, 10 pizzas is sufficient.

Wait, but 10 pizzas is 80 slices, which is 8 slices less than needed. So, is 10 pizzas enough? Or does he need 11 pizzas?

Wait, 10 pizzas is 8 slices, which is 8 slices less than needed. So, 10 pizzas is insufficient. 11 pizzas is 8 slices, which is still insufficient. 12 pizzas
