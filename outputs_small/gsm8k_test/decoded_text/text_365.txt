Q: There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys in the park, how many kids are in the park?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I identify the number of girls in the park, which is 6.

Next, I determine the number of boys by noting that there are twice as many boys as girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 2 multiplied by 6, resulting in 12 boys.

Finally, to find the total number of kids in the park, I add the number of girls and boys together: 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   - There are **6** girls in the park.

2. **Number of Boys:**
   - The number of boys is twice the number of girls.
   - Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls = 2 × 6 = **12** boys.

3. **Total Number of Kids:**
   - Total kids = Number of girls + Number of boys = 6 + 12 = **18** kids.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
