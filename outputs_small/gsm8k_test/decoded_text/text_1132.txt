Q: Valerie earns $5000 per month, 1/2 of what her brother earns. If their mother earns twice their combined salary, what's the total amount of money they all have together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Valerie, her brother, and their mother's salaries. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Valerie earns $5000 per month. Hmm, okay, that's straightforward. Then it says she earns half of what her brother earns. So, if Valerie makes $50000, her brother must make twice that amount, right? Because if her brother makes twice as much as Valerie, then her brother's salary is 2 times $50000. Let me write that down.

Valerie's salary: $5000 per month.

Her brother's salary: 2 * Valerie's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10000 per month.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. If Valerie makes half of her brother's salary, then her brother makes twice as much. So, if Valerie is $5000, her brother is $10000. Yeah, that makes sense. So, her brother makes $10000 per month.

Now, the problem also mentions their mother earns twice their combined salary. Hmm, so first, I need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother, and then the mother's salary is twice that amount.

Let me calculate the combined salary first. Valerie makes $5000, her brother makes $10000. So, adding those together: $5000 + $10000. Wait, that's $5000 + $10,000. Let me add those numbers.

$5000 + $10000 = $15000. So, their combined salary is $15000 per month.

Now, their mother earns twice this combined salary. So, twice $15000 is $30000. So, the mother makes $30000 per month.

Now, the question is asking for the total amount of money they all have together. So, that would be Valerie's salary plus her brother's salary plus their mother's salary.

Let me add those up:

Valerie: $5000

Brother: $10000

Mother: $30000

Total = $5000 + $10000 + $30000.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Then, $15000 + $30000 = $45000.

So, altogether, they have $45000 per month.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up.

So, Valerie: $5000

Her brother: $10000

Mother: $30000

Adding them up: 5000 + 10000 is 15000, plus 30000 is 45000. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding all three together:

5000 + 10000 + 30000.

Let me add 5000 and 10000 first: that's 15000.

Then, 15000 + 30000: 15000 + 30000 is 45000.

Yep, that's consistent.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000 per month.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Valerie: $5000

Brother: $10000

Mother: $30000

Total: $45000

Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the total amount is $45000.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of money they all have together is \boxed{45000}.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice that amount, which is $10000 per month. 

First, we calculate their combined salary:
\[
5000 + 10000 = 15000
\]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[
2 \times 15000 = 30000
\]

Adding up all their
