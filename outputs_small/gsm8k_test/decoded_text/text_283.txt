Q: Katerina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Katerina making topaz necklaces. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says she uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Each gemstone is one inch long, and between each gemstone, she fills the space with a sterling silver bead. Each bead is a quarter of an inch long. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. The question is asking how many of these beads she uses per necklace.

Alright, let's break this down. First, each necklace has 8 gemstones. Each gemstone is 1 inch long. So, if there are 8 gemstones, the total length just from the gemstones would be 8 times 1 inch, which is 8 inches. But wait, the necklace is 25 inches long. That means the beads must take up the remaining space.

So, total necklace length is 25 inches. Gemstones take up 8 inches. So, the beads must take up 25 minus 8 inches. Let me calculate that: 25 - 8 is 17 inches. So, the beads together are 17 inches long.

Now, each bead is a quarter of an inch long. So, to find out how many beads there are, I need to divide the total length of the beads by the length of each bead. That would be 17 inches divided by 0.25 inches per bead.

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. 1/4 inch is 0.25 inches. So, 17 divided by 0.25. Hmm, dividing by a decimal can be tricky. Maybe I can convert that to a fraction. 0.25 is the same as 1/4, so dividing by 1/4 is the same as multiplying by 4. So, 17 times 4 is 68. So, 17 divided by 0.25 is 68.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each bead is 0.25 inches, then 0.25 times 68 is 17. So, 68 beads would be 17 inches. That makes sense. So, the total length of the beads is 17 inches, which is 25 inches minus 8 inches from the gemstones.

So, that would mean Katerina uses 68 beads per necklace. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. 8 gemstones, each 1 inch, so 8 inches. Total necklace is 25 inches, so beads take up 17 inches. Each bead is 0.25 inches, so 17 divided by 0.25 is 68. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just visualize it. Imagine a necklace that's 25 inches long. At the start, the first gemstone is 1 inch. Then, between each gemstone, there's a bead. So, for 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them, each filled with a bead. So, 7 beads. But wait, that's only 7 beads, but the total beads are 68. That seems like a lot more. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, hold on. Maybe the beads are not just between the gemstones but also at the ends? Or maybe the beads are placed between each gemstone, but the necklace is made by putting all the beads together? Hmm, the problem says she fills the space between gemstones using beads. So, each space between gemstones is filled with a bead. So, for 8 gemstones, there are 7 spaces between them, each filled with a bead. So, 7 beads. But the total beads are 68, which is way more than 7. So, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the number of spaces. Let me think. If there are 8 gemstones, the number of spaces between them is 7. So, 7 beads. But the total beads are 68. So, that's a big difference. So, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the beads are not just between the gemstones but also at the ends? So, if there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch, and the beads are placed between them, but also at the beginning and the end. So, that would be 8 gemstones plus 2 beads (one at each end). But that would be 10 beads, which is still not 68.

Wait, maybe the beads are placed between each gemstone, but each bead is a quarter inch, so each bead is between two gemstones. So, for
