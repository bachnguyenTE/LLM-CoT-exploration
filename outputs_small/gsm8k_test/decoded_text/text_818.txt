Q: Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. If Robert has 20 cars, how many cars does joe remain with after selling and giving some to his mother?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Joe and Robert with their cars. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I break it down, I can manage it.

First, the problem says: "Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. If Robert has 20 cars, how many cars does Joe remain with after selling and giving some to his mother?"

Alright, let's parse this information.

1. **Relationship between Joe and Robert's cars:**
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, if Robert has R cars, Joe has 2R cars.

2. **Given information:**
   - Robert has 20 cars. So, R = 20.
   - Joe has twice as many, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

3. **What happens next:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - He gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.

4. **We need to find out how many cars Joe has left after these transactions.

Let me write down the steps.

**Step 1: Determine how many cars Joe has initially.**

Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice that, so 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

**Step 2: Calculate how many cars Joe sells.**

He sells 20% of his cars. So, 20% of 40 cars.

To find 20% of 40, I can compute 0.20 * 40.

Let me do that: 0.20 * 40 = 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

**Step 3: Determine how many cars Joe gives to his mother.**

He gives away twice as many cars as he sold. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cars Joe gives away.**

He sold 8 cars and gave 16 cars to his mother. So, total cars given away: 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

**Step 5: Subtract the total cars given away from Joe's initial number of cars to find how many he has left.**

Joe initially had 40 cars. He gave away 24 cars. So, 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.

Wait, let me double-check that.

He sold 8 cars, so 40 - 8 = 32 cars left. Then he gave 16 cars to his mother, so 32 - 16 = 16 cars remaining. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the percentages or the multiplication.

He has 40 cars. 20% of 40 is 8, correct. Then twice that is 16, correct. So, 8 + 16 = 24 cars given away. 40 - 24 = 16. Yeah, that seems consistent.

So, Joe has 16 cars left after selling and giving some to his mother.

**Wait a second, let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly.**

The problem says: "He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother."

So, he sells 20% of his own cars, which is 8, and then gives away twice that number, which is 16. So, total given away is 24, so 40 - 24 = 16. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as two separate transactions: first, selling 20%, then giving away twice that amount. So, 20% is 8, then giving away 16, so total 24. So, 40 - 24 = 16.

Alternatively, if I thought of it as giving away twice the number he sold, so 2 * 8 = 16, so total given away is 8 + 16 = 24. So, same result.

So, I think that's correct.

But just to be thorough, let me write down all the steps in a table.

| Person | Initial Cars | Percentage Sold | Cars Sold | Cars Given to Mother | Total Given Away | Remaining Cars |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Robert | 20           | -               | -          | -                     | -               | 20              |
| Joe
