Q: Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Julie and Jewel operating the cash register. It says Julie works exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Jewel processes 50 customers daily. I need to find the total weekly production for both of them if they work all days of the week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Julie is twice as fast as Jewel. So, if Jewel can process a certain number of customers in a day, Julie can process twice that number in the same time. Since they work all days of the week, I need to calculate their daily production and then multiply by seven days.

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Wait, 50? That seems like a typo. Probably meant 50 customers, which is 50 customers. So, 50 is 50, which is 50 customers. So, 50 customers per day for Jewel.

Since Julie is twice as fast, that means Julie can process twice as many customers in the same amount of time. So, if Jewel processes 50 customers in a day, Julie would process 2 times 50 customers. Let me write that down.

Jewel's daily production: 50 customers.

Julie's daily production: 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? If Julie is twice as fast, does that mean she can process twice as many customers in the same time? Yes, that makes sense. So, if Jewel takes, say, 1 minute per customer, Julie would take half a minute per customer, so she can process twice as many in the same time.

So, yes, Julie's daily production is 100 customers.

Now, I need to find their total weekly production. They work all days of the week, which is 7 days.

So, let's calculate each of their weekly production.

Jewel's weekly production: 50 customers/day * 7 days.

Let me compute that. 50 * 7. 50 times 7 is 350. So, 350 customers per week.

Julie's weekly production: 100 customers/day * 7 days.

100 times 7 is 700. So, 700 customers per week.

Now, to find the total weekly production for both, I need to add their weekly production together.

Total weekly production: 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my calculations.

Jewel: 50 *7=350. Correct.

Julie: 100 *7=700. Correct.

Total: 350 +700=1050. That seems right.

But let me think again about the initial statement. It says Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. So, if they work all days of the week, does that mean they work 7 days a week? I think so, yes.

So, if both work 7 days, their total production is 350 +700=1050.

Wait, but hold on. Is the question asking for the total production for both of them combined? So, yes, 1050 is the total.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of per day production and then multiply by 7.

But I think my initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of their rates.

Jewel's rate: 50 customers per day.

Julie's rate: twice as fast, so 100 customers per day.

Total per day: 50 +100=150 customers.

Total per week:150 *7=1050.

Yes, same result.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of per hour or something, but the problem doesn't specify the time it takes to process a customer, so I think it's safe to assume that the rates are per day.

So, I think 1050 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't misinterpret the problem.

It says "Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel." So, if Jewel takes, say, 1 minute per customer, Julie would take 0.5 minutes per customer, so she can process twice as many in the same time.

So, yes, if Jewel processes 50 customers in a day, Julie processes 100 customers in a day.

So, 50 +100=150 per day, 150*7=1050.

Yes
