Q: Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago. She has been playing 40 games every year. If her score for every game is 21 points, calculate the total number of points she has scored in the four years.

Okay, so Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago, and she's been playing 40 games every year. Each game she scores 21 points. I need to find out the total number of points she's scored in those four years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that she plays 40 games each year. So, over four years, the total number of games she's played would be 40 games/year multiplied by 4 years. Let me write that down:

Total games = 40 games/year * 4 years

Calculating that, 40 times 4 is... let me see, 40 times 4 is 160, so 40 times 4 is 168. So, Ara has played 168 games in total.

Now, each of those games she scores 21 points. So, to find the total points, I need to multiply the total number of games by her points per game. That would be:

Total points = Total games * Points per game

Plugging in the numbers:

Total points = 168 games * 21 points/game

Hmm, 168 times 21. Let me break that down. Maybe I can do 168 times 20 and then 168 times 1, and add them together.

First, 168 * 20. 168 times 2 is 336, so 168 * 20 is 3360.

Then, 168 * 1 is 168.

Adding those together: 3360 + 168. Let me add the units place: 0 + 8 is 8. Tens place: 6 + 6 is 12, so carry over 1. Hundreds place: 3 + 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 makes 5. Thousands place: 3. So, 3360 + 168 is 3528.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the addition.

Wait, 3360 + 168. Let's add 3360 + 100 = 3460, then 3460 + 68 = 3528. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3360 + 168 is 3528.

So, Ara has scored a total of 3528 points in the four years.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Maybe I should do it another way to verify.

Alternatively, 168 * 21 can be thought of as 168 * (20 + 1) = 168*20 + 168*1.

168*20 is 3360, and 168*1 is 168, so adding them gives 3360 + 168 = 3528. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can do 168 * 21. Let me think, 168 * 2 is 336, and then times 10 is 3360, plus 168 is 3528. Still the same.

So, I think that's correct.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If she plays 40 games each year, that's 40*4=168 games. Each game is 21 points, so 168*21=3528. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 21 points per game, so over four years, she's played 168 games, so 21*168. Let me compute 21*168.

21*100=2100, 21*60=1260, 21*8=168. So, 2100 + 1260 is 3360, plus 168 is 3528. Wait, that's 3528? Wait, no, 21*168 is 3528? Wait, no, 21*168 is 3528? Wait, 21*168 is 3528? Wait, 21*100 is 2100, 21*60 is 1260, 21*8
