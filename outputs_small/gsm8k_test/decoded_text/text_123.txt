Q: Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rosie and her running. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours? Hmm, okay. So, she has two different speeds for different periods of time, and we need to find the total distance she can run in 7 hours.

Let me break it down. She runs at 10 mph for the first 3 hours. Then, after that, she slows down to 5 mph. But wait, how long does she run at the slower speed? The total time is 7 hours, and she's already been running for 3 hours at the faster speed. So, the remaining time she can run at 5 mph would be 7 minus 3, which is 4 hours. 

So, to find the total distance, I need to calculate the distance she covers in the first 3 hours and then add the distance she covers in the next 4 hours at 5 mph. 

Distance is calculated by speed multiplied by time, right? So, for the first part, her speed is 10 mph and time is 3 hours. So, distance1 = 10 mph * 3 hours. Let me compute that: 10 * 3 is 30. So, she runs 30 miles in the first 3 hours.

Now, for the second part, her speed is 5 mph and the time is 4 hours. So, distance2 = 5 mph * 4 hours. That would be 5 * 4, which is 20. So, she runs 20 miles in the next 4 hours.

To find the total distance, I just add distance1 and distance2 together. So, 30 miles + 20 miles equals 53 miles. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 10 mph for 3 hours is indeed 30 miles, and 5 mph for 4 hours is 20 miles. 30 plus 20 is 53. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the time calculation. She runs for 3 hours at 10 mph, then the remaining time is 7 minus 3, which is 4 hours. So, 4 hours at 5 mph is 20 miles. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as two separate legs of her run. First leg: 10 mph for 3 hours, second leg: 5 mph for 4 hours. So, 10*3 is 30, 5*4 is 20, total is 50. Wait, hold on, that's 50, not 53. Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 53. Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, no, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 53? Wait, 30 plus 20 is 50?
