Q: Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?

Okay, so I need to figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

He sold his house for $400,000. That's the selling price. Now, he paid transfer fees and brokerage fees. Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, and the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. So, I need to calculate all these expenses and subtract them from the selling price to get the net proceeds.

First, let me calculate the transfer fees. Transfer fees are 3% of $400,000. Hmm, 3% is the same as 0.03 in decimal. So, 0.03 multiplied by 400,000. Let me do that calculation.

400,000 * 0.03. Let me break it down: 400,000 * 0.03 is the same as 400,000 * 3/100. So, 400,000 divided by 100 is 4,000. Then, 4,000 multiplied by 3 is 12,000. So, transfer fees are $12,000.

Next, the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. 5% is 0.05. So, 400,000 * 0.05. Let me compute that. 400,000 * 0.05 is 200,000. So, the brokerage fee is $200,000.

Now, he also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. So, that's another expense. So, all the expenses are transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the loan amount.

Let me add up all these expenses: transfer fees ($120,000) + brokerage fees ($200,000) + loan amount ($250,0000). So, 120,0000 + 200,000 is 320,000, and then adding 250,000 gives 570,000.

So, total expenses are $570,0000.

Now, the selling price was $400,000. So, net proceeds would be selling price minus total expenses. So, 400,000 - 570,000. Wait, that can't be right because 400,000 is less than 570,000. That would mean he lost money, which doesn't make sense because he sold it for 400,000, but he had to pay more in fees and loan.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding the expenses. Let me check again.

Transfer fees: 3% of 400,000 is 12,000. Correct.

Brokerage fee: 5% of 400,000 is 200,000. Correct.

Loan amount: 250,000. Correct.

So, total expenses: 12,000 + 200,000 + 250,000. Let me add them step by step.

12,000 + 200,000 is 212,000. Then, 212,000 + 250,000 is 467,000. Wait, that's different from before. So, total expenses are $467,000.

Wait, so 12,000 + 200,000 is 320,000, plus 250,000 is 282,000. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 12,000 + 200,000 is 212,000, plus 250,000 is 467,000. So, total expenses are $467,000.

So, net proceeds would be selling price minus total expenses: 400,000 - 467,000. Let me compute that.

400,000 minus 467,000
