Q: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards. That seems straightforward. Then, after a month, she collected three times that number. Hmm, okay, so if she had 20 initially, three times that would be... let me calculate that. 3 times 20 is 60. So, after the first month, she has 20 plus 60, which is 82 cards. Wait, no, hold on. The question says she initially had 20, and then after a month, she collected three times that number. So, does that mean she added three times the original amount, or did she have 20 and then collected three times that? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again.

"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number." So, "that number" refers to the initial amount, which is 20. So, she collected three times that, which is 3*20=60. So, she had 20 initially, then she collected 60, so total after first month is 20+60=82. Okay, that makes sense.

Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected 60 in the first month, so in the second month, she collected 60-20=40. Wait, 60 minus 20 is 40. So, 40 cards in the second month. So, after the second month, her total would be 82 + 40=122. Hmm, okay.

Then, in the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. So, first month:60, second month:40. Combined, that's 60. Twice that would be 120. So, she collected 120 in the third month. So, adding that to her previous total of 122, she now has 122+120=242.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, initial:20. First month:3*20=60. Total after first month:20+60=80. Wait, hold on, wait, 20+60 is 80, not 82. Did I make a mistake earlier? Because 20+60 is 80, not 82. So, that's a problem. So, maybe I misread the initial part.

Wait, the problem says: "After a month, she collected three times that number." So, "that number" is the initial amount, which is 20. So, she collected 3*20=60. So, total after first month is 20+60=80. Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer than the first month. So, 60-20=40. So, total after second month is 80+40=128. Then, in the third month, she collected twice the combined number from first and second months. So, first and second months:60+40=100. Twice that is 200. So, total after third month is 128+200=328.

Wait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 82, but that was a miscalculation. So, let me go through it again.

Initial:20.

First month:3*20=60. So, total after first month:20+60=86.

Second month:60-20=40. So, total after second month:86+40=126.

Third month:2*(60+40)=2*100=200. So, total after third month:126+200=326.

Wait, so that's 326. Hmm, but let me make sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me parse the problem again.

"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number." So, initial:20. After first month: she collected 3*20=60. So, total after first month:20+60=80.

Then, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer than those she collected in the first month. So, 60-20=40. So, total after
