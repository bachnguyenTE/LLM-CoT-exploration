Q: Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?

Okay, so I have this problem about Fishio's Instagram likes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. After 1 week, she received 2000 likes on the photo. Then, three weeks later, which is 28 days later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. Wait, hold on, the initial number of likes is 2000, right? Because after 1 week, it was 2000. So, three weeks later, the likes were 70 times that initial number. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because 70 times 2000 would be a huge number, but then it says she received 20000 more new likes recently. So, I need to find the total number of likes now.

Let me break it down. Let me denote the initial number of likes as L. So, L = 2000. After 1 week, that's 2000 likes. Then, three weeks later, the likes were 70 times that initial number. So, that would be 70 * L. Wait, 70 times? Is that 70 times the initial number or 70 times the likes after 1 week? Hmm, the wording says "70 times as many as the initial number of likes." So, it's 70 times the initial number. So, 70 * L.

But wait, 70 times 2000 is 1,400,000. That seems like a lot. But then, it says she received 20002 more new likes recently. So, I think that means the total likes now are 1,400,000 plus 20,002. Let me check that.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?"

Wait, so the initial number of likes is 2000. After 1 week, it was 2000 likes. Then, three weeks later, the likes were 70 times as many as the initial number. So, 70 * 2000 = 1,400,000. Then, she received 20,002 more likes recently. So, total likes now would be 1,400,000 + 20,002 = 1,420,002.

Wait, but 20000 is written as 20002? That seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check the original problem again.

"Fishio posted her selfie on Instagram. She received 2000 likes on the photo after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. If she received 20000 more new likes recently, how many Instagram likes are there?"

Wait, 20000 is written as 20002. Maybe that's a typo. So, perhaps it's 20,000 more likes. So, 20,000. So, total likes now would be 1,400,000 + 20,000 = 1,420,004.

Wait, but 70 times the initial number is 70 * 2000 = 1,540,000. Then, adding 20,004 gives 1,564,004. Hmm, that seems different.

Wait, maybe I need to model this differently. Let me think.

Let me denote the initial number of likes as L. So, L = 2000. After 1 week, it's 2000 likes. Then, three weeks later, the likes were 70 times as many as the initial number. So, 70 * L = 70 * 2000 = 1,540,700? Wait, 70 * 2000 is 1,400,000, and 70 * 2000 is 1,400,000? Wait, 70 * 200
