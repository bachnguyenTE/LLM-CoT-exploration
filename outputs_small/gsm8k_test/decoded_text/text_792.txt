Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Damien created a currency using bottle caps. Each day, he finds 10 bottle caps, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, I need to calculate his total earnings over 30 days.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, how much money does he make each day? He gets 10 bottle caps a day, and each is worth $0.25. So, I should multiply the number of bottle caps by the value per cap.

Let me write that out: 10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap. That should give me his daily earnings.

Calculating that: 10 * 0.25. Hmm, 10 times 0.25. Well, 10 is the same as 10.00, so 10.00 * 0.25. Let me do the multiplication.

10.00 * 0.25. Let's think of 0.25 as a quarter. So, 10 bottle caps times a quarter. A quarter is $0.25, so 10 times $0.25. 10 * 0.25 is 2.50. So, he makes $2.50 each day.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me double-check. 10 * 0.25. 10 * 0.2 is 2.00, and 10 * 0.05 is 0.50. So, adding those together, 2.00 + 0.50 is 2.50. So, yes, $2.50 per day.

Okay, so he makes $2.50 each day. Now, he wants to know how much he makes in a 30-day month. So, I need to multiply his daily earnings by 30.

So, $2.50/day * 30 days. Let me compute that.

First, let's break it down. 2.50 * 30. Hmm, 2.50 * 30. I can think of 30 as 3 * 10. So, 2.50 * 3 is 7.50, and then times 10 is 75.00.

Wait, let me verify that. 2.50 * 30. 2.50 * 10 is 25.00, so 25.00 * 3 is 75.00. So, yes, $75.00.

Alternatively, I can think of 30 as 20 + 10. So, 2.50 * 20 is 50.00, and 2.50 *10 is 25.00. Adding those together, 50 +25 is 75.00. So, same result.

So, he makes $75.00 in a 30-day month.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the daily calculation. He gets 10 bottle caps a day, each worth $0.25. So, 10 * 0.25 is 2.50. That seems right because 10 * 0.25 is like 10 * 1/4, which is 10/4, which is 2.50. So, yes, $2.50 per day.

Then, 2.50 *30. Let me do this another way to confirm. 30 is 30, so 2.50 *30. Let's think of 30 as 30.00. So, 2.50 *30.00.

Wait, maybe it's easier to do 2.50 *30. Let me write it as:

2.50
* 30
-------
Multiply 2.50 by 0, which is 0.00
Multiply 2.50 by 30, which is 7.50
Then add them together: 0.00 +7.50=7.50

Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2.50 *30 is 75.50, not 7.50. Wait, maybe I messed up the decimal places.

Wait, 2.50 is two dollars and fifty cents. So
