Q: Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. I need to find what percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The shark is 10 feet long, and on it, there are two 6-inch remoras. I need to find out what percentage these two remoras make up of the total length of the shark. So, essentially, I need to calculate the combined length of the two remoras and then find out what percentage that is of the entire shark's body.

Alright, let's start by converting all the measurements to the same unit to make it easier. The shark's length is given in feet, and the remoras are given in inches. I think it would be easier to convert everything to inches because the remoras are in inches. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 10 feet would be 10 times 12 inches. Let me calculate that.

10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 144 inches. So, the shark is 144 inches long.

Now, each remoras is 6 inches long, and there are two of them. So, the combined length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches. Let me compute that.

2 * 6 inches = 12 inches. So, the two remoras together are 12 inches long.

Now, I need to find what percentage 12 inches is of the shark's total length, which is 144 inches. To find a percentage, I can use the formula:

Percentage = (Part / Whole) * 100

In this case, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras, which is 12 inches, and the "Whole" is the total length of the shark, which is 144 inches.

So, plugging the numbers in:

Percentage = (12 inches / 144 inches) * 100

Let me compute that. First, divide 12 by 144.

12 / 144 = 0.08333... (repeating)

Then, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

0.08333... * 100 = 83.333...%

So, approximately 83.333% of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10 feet is 120 inches? Wait, no, 10 feet is 120 inches? Wait, hold on, 10 feet is 120 inches? Wait, no, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 10 feet is 10*12=120 inches. Wait, but earlier I thought 10 feet is 144 inches. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.

The problem says the shark is 10 feet long. So, 10 feet is 10*12=120 inches. So, 120 inches is the total length of the shark.

But earlier, I thought 10 feet is 144 inches, which was incorrect. So, I need to correct that.

So, let me recast the problem with the correct measurements.

Shark's total length: 10 feet = 120 inches.

Each remoras: 6 inches.

Number of remoras: 2.

Combined length of remoras: 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

So, now, the percentage is (12 / 120) * 100.

Let me compute that.

12 divided by 120 is equal to 0/10, which is 0.083333...

Wait, 12 divided by 120: 12 ÷ 120. Let me compute that.

12 ÷ 120 = 0.1, because 120 divided by 12 is 10, so 12 divided by 120 is 1/10, which is approximately 0.090909...

Wait, hold on, 12 divided by 120 is 0.1? Wait, no, 120 divided by 12 is 10, so 12 divided by 120 is 0.1. Wait,
