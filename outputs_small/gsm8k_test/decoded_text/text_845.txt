Q: There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, 8 of them perform well in English only, and the rest are good at both math and English. How many are good at math?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Miss Susan's class with 20 students. Let me try to figure out how many are good at math. Hmm, the problem says there are 5 students who are good at math only, 8 students who are good at English only, and the rest are good at both math and English. I need to find out how many are good at math in total.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the total number of students is 20. So, 20 students in total. Now, out of these, 5 are only good at math, and 8 are only good at English. The rest are good at both. So, I think I need to use some kind of set theory here, maybe a Venn diagram or something.

Let me recall, in set theory, when we have two sets, like math and English, the total number of elements is the sum of the elements in each set minus the elements that are in both sets. That's the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, if I let M be the set of students good at math and E be the set of students good at English, then the total number of students is M + E - both.

Wait, but in this problem, they've given me the number of students who are only in M, only in E, and both. So, maybe I can use that information to find M.

Let me denote:
- Only math: 5
- Only English: 8
- Both math and English: let's call this x

So, the total number of students is only math plus only English plus both. So, 5 + 8 + x = 20.

Wait, that makes sense because if I add up all the students who are only math, only English, and both, that should give me the total number of students in the class.

So, 5 + 8 + x = 20. Let me compute that. 5 + 8 is 13, so 13 + x = 20. Therefore, x = 20 - 13 = 7. So, x is 7. That means 7 students are good at both math and English.

But the question is asking how many are good at math in total. So, that would be the number of students only good at math plus the number good at both. So, that's 5 + 7 = 12.

Wait, hold on, 5 only math, 7 both, so 5 + 7 is 12. So, 12 students are good at math in total.

But let me double-check that. If there are 5 only math, 8 only English, and 7 both, then adding them up: 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. That's correct because the total number of students is 20. So, that seems to add up.

So, the number of of students good at math is 5 + 7 = 12. Wait, hold on, that's 12, not 12. Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? No, 5 + 7 is 12. Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, no, 5 + 7 is 12. Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, no, 5 + 7 is 12. Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, 5 + 7 is 12? Wait, no,
