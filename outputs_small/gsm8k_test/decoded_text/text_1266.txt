Okay, so I have this problem here about a Kennel house that keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms a day. The question is asking how many kilograms of dog food they'll need in a week. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how much each type of dog consumes in a week. Since a week has 7 days, I can multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption for each dog. 

Starting with the German Shepherds: there are 3 of them, and each eats 5 kg per day. So, for one German Shepherd, in a week, it would be 5 kg multiplied by 7 days. Let me calculate that: 5 times 7 is 35. So, one German Shepherd eats 35 kg a week. Since there are 3 of them, I need to multiply 35 kg by 3. Let me do that: 35 times 3 is 105. Wait, no, that can't be right. 35 times 3 is actually 105? Wait, no, 35 times 3 is 105? Wait, 35 times 3 is 105? Wait, 35 times 3 is 105? Wait, 35 times 3 is 105? Wait, no, 35 times 3 is 105?
