Q: Mariah’s grandma was teaching her to knit. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mariah and her grandma teaching each other to knit. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. There are 364 yards in a skein. I need to find out how many yards they used altogether. Hmm, okay, so I think I need to add the yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma, and then convert that into yards.

Let me write down what I know:

- Mariah used 1/4 skein.
- Grandma used 1/2 skein.
- 1 skein = 364 yards.

So, first, I should add the fractions to find the total yarn used. That would be 1/4 plus 1/2. Hmm, adding fractions. I remember that to add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The denominators here are 4 and 2. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4, right? So, I can convert 1/2 to 2/4. 

So, 1/4 + 2/4 equals 3/4. So, together, they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn. 

Now, since 1 skein is 364 yards, 3/4 of a skein would be 3/4 multiplied by 364 yards. Let me write that down: 3/4 * 364. 

Hmm, how do I multiply a fraction by a whole number? I think I can multiply the numerator by the whole number and then divide by the denominator. So, 3 times 364 is... let me calculate that. 

364 times 3. Let's break it down: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 364*3 is 1092. 

Now, divide that by 4. So, 1092 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 

4 goes into 10 two times (since 4*2=8), remainder 2. Bring down the 9, making it 29. 4 goes into 29 seven times (4*7=28), remainder 1. Bring down the 2, making it 12. 4 goes into 12 three times. So, putting it all together, 1092 divided by 4 is 273. 

So, 3/4 of a skein is 273 yards. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication or division. 

Alternatively, I can think of 364 divided by 4 first, which is 91, and then multiply by 3. So, 91*3 is 273. Yeah, that's the same result. So, that seems correct.

So, altogether, they used 273 yards of yarn.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the fractions. 1/4 plus 1/2 is 3/4, that's right. 3/4 of 364 is 273. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's the answer. So, the total yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards.

**Final Answer**
They used a total of \boxed{273} yards of yarn altogether.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. To find the total yarn used, we first add the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we convert the fraction of a skein to yards. Since 1 skein is 364 yards, we calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Thus, the total yards of yarn they used altogether is \(\boxed{273}\).
