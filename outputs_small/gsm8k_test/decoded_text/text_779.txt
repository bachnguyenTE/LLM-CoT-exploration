Q: The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?

Okay, so I have this problem about the Llesis family's trip to their vacation spot. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find out how far their vacation spot is. Hmm, let's see.

First, the family drove for 6 hours. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. So, I can calculate the distance they drove by multiplying their speed by the time they spent driving. That should be straightforward.

Then, they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Wait, so I need to figure out their hiking speed first before I can calculate the distance they hiked.

Let me write down the given information:

- Driving time: 6 hours
- Driving speed: 50 mph
- Hiking time: 1.5 hours
- Hiking speed: 5 mph less than half their driving speed

Alright, so first, let me find half of their driving speed. Half of 50 mph is 25 mph. Then, subtract 5 mph from that. So, 25 - 5 = 20 mph. So, their hiking speed is 20 mph.

Wait, hold on, 25 minus 5 is 20? Yeah, that seems right. So, they hiked at 20 mph.

Now, to find the distance they hiked, I can use the formula: distance = speed × time. So, 20 mph multiplied by 1.5 hours. Let me calculate that.

20 × 1.5. Hmm, 20 times 1 is 20, and 20 times 0.5 is 10. So, 20 + 10 is 32. So, they hiked 32 miles.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 20 × 1.5 is the same as 20 × (1 + 0.5) = 20 ×1 + 20 ×0.5 = 20 + 10 = 32. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the distance they hiked is 32 miles.

Now, the total distance to their vacation spot would be the distance they drove plus the distance they hiked. So, the driving distance is 50 mph ×6 hours, which is 300 miles. Then, adding the hiking distance of 32 miles.

So, 300 + 32 = 332 miles.

Wait, hold on, 50 ×6 is 300, right? 50 times 6 is 300. Then, 300 +32 is 332. So, the total distance is 332 miles.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, driving speed is 50 mph, time is 6 hours, so 50 ×6 is 300. Hiking speed is half of 50, which is 25, minus 5 is 20. Hiking time is 1.5 hours, so 20 ×1.5 is 32. Then, 300 +32 is 332. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive." So, is the hiking speed 5 mph less than half their driving speed? So, half of 50 is 25, minus 5 is 20. So, 20 mph. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if it had said "half their driving speed minus 5," that would be different, but it says "5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive." So, half their driving speed is 25, minus 5 is 20. So, 20 mph. So, that's correct.

So, yeah, 20 mph hiking, 1.5 hours, so 32 miles. 50 mph driving, 6 hours, so 300 miles. Total is 332 miles.

Wait, but let me just think again. Is the driving speed 50 mph, so 50 ×6 is 300. Hiking speed is 20 mph, 20 ×1.5 is 32. So, 300 +32 is 332. So, 332 miles.

Wait, but 50 ×6 is 300, 20 ×1.5 is 30, so 300 +32 is 332. Yeah, that's
