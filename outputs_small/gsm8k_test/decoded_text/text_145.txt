Q: John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest within a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his pineapple field. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. Hmm, wait, no, actually, it says 10 hectares. Let me check: "John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field." Yeah, that's correct. So, he has 10 hectares. Wait, no, 10? That's 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10? Wait, no, 10 is 10. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem says: "John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field." So, that's 10 hectares. So, 10 hectares. Okay, so 10 hectares. Got it.

Then, it says there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, 100 pineapples per hectare. So, per hectare, he can harvest 100 pineapples. So, 100 per hectare.

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. So, every 3 months, he can harvest. So, how many times does he harvest in a year?

Okay, so a year is 12 months. If he harvests every 3 months, then the number of harvests in a year is 12 divided by 3, which is 4. So, 4 harvests in a year.

So, each harvest is 100 pineapples per hectare. So, per harvest, he gets 100 pineapples per hectare. So, over 4 harvests, he would get 4 times 100 per hectare.

Wait, but hold on, is that per hectare? So, per hectare, he gets 100 per harvest, so 4 harvests would be 400 per hectare.

But wait, he has 10 hectares. So, total pineapples would be 400 per hectare times 10 hectares.

So, 400 times 10 is 4000. So, 4000 pineapples in a year.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, 10 hectares, 100 pineapples per hectare. So, total pineapples per year would be 10 times 100, which is 1000 per year. But wait, that's if he harvests every year. But he harvests every 3 months, so he harvests 4 times a year.

So, 1000 per year divided by 4 harvests is 250 per harvest. So, 250 times 4 is 1000. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it. Because if he harvests every 3 months, he gets 100 per hectare every 3 months, so 4 times a year. So, per year, per hectare, he gets 4 times 100, which is 400. So, 400 per year per hectare. So, 400 times 10 is 4000.

Wait, so that's 4000. So, 4000 pineapples in a year.

Wait, but 100 per hectare per year is 1000, but since he harvests 4 times a year, it's 1000 divided by 4 is 250 per harvest, so 250 times 4 is 1000. Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think.

Total area: 10 hectares.
