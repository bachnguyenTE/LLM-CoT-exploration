Q: Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Okay, so Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes on a football field that's 100 yards long. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure out how far each of them runs and then see who wins and by how much.

First, let's break down Blake's run. He runs back and forth 15 times. Each time he goes back and forth means he covers the length of the field twice, right? So, each back-and-forth is 200 yards. Let me write that down.

Blake's total distance:
He does this 15 times, so 15 times 200 yards. Let me calculate that. 15 * 200. Hmm, 10 times 200 is 220 yards, so 15 times would be 5 * 220. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 10 yards is the length, so each back-and-forth is 200 yards. So, 15 times that would be 15 * 200. Let me compute that: 10 * 220 is 2200, but wait, no, 15 * 220. Let me do 10 * 220 = 2200, and 5 * 220 = 1100, so total is 2220 yards. Wait, that seems high. Wait, 15 times 200 is 3000 yards? Wait, no, 200 * 15. Let me do 200 *15 first. 200*15=3000, so 200*15=3000, so 200*15=3000. Then 0*15=0, so total is 3000 yards. Wait, that can't be right because 200 yards is the length, so 15 times back and forth would be 15*200=3000 yards. Wait, I think I messed up the multiplication.

Wait, 200 yards is the length of the field, so each back-and-forth is 200 yards. So, 15 times that is 15*200. 10*200=2000, 5*200=1000, so total is 3000 yards. Okay, that makes sense. So Blake runs 3000 yards.

Now, let's move on to Kelly. She runs back and forth once, and then decides to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Hmm, okay, so first, she runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards. Then, she goes to the 40-yard line and back. Wait, the field is 100 yards long, so the 40-yard line is 40 yards from the start, right? So, from the start to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and back is another 40 yards, so that's 80 yards. So, each time she does that, she runs 80 yards.

Wait, but hold on, is she starting from the same point? Or is she starting from the 40-yard line? The problem says she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. So, I think she starts at the starting point, runs to the 40-yard line, which is 40 yards, and then back to the starting point, which is another 44 yards. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the field is 100 yards long, so the 40-yard line is 40 yards from the start. So, from the start to the 40-yard line is 40 yards, and back is another 44 yards? Wait, that would be 88 yards. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 40 yards to the 40-yard line is 44 yards back? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. If the field is 100 yards long, then the 40-yard line is 40 yards from the start. So, if she runs to the 40-yard line, that's 40 yards, and then back to the start is another 40 yards, so total of 80 yards per time. So, each time she does that, she runs 80 yards.
