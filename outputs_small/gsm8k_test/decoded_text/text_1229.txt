Q: In November, a toy was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the price of a toy over three months: November, December, and January. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the toy was priced at $40 in November. That seems straightforward. Then, in December, the price increased by 80%. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate what the new price is after an 80% increase. I remember that to find a percentage increase, you take the original amount, multiply it by the percentage (converted to decimal), and then add that to the original amount. 

So, 80% as a decimal is 0.8. Let me write that down:

Original price in November: $40.

Percentage increase in December: 80% = 0.8.

So, the increase amount is 40 * 0.8. Let me compute that. 40 times 0.8. Hmm, 40 * 0.8 is the same as 40 * 8/10, which is 32. So, the increase is $32. 

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 40 times 0.8: 40 * 0.8. 40 * 0.8 is 32. Yeah, that's correct. So, the price in December is the original price plus the increase, which is 40 + 32. That equals $72. So, the price in December is $72. 

Okay, moving on to January. The price decreased by 50%. So, I need to find 50% of $72 and subtract that from the December price. 

First, let me convert 50% to a decimal, which is 0.5. 

So, the decrease amount is 72 * 0.5. Let me calculate that. 72 * 0.5 is 36. So, the price decreases by $36 in January.

Therefore, the price after the decrease is 72 - 36. Let me do that subtraction. 72 minus 36 is 36. So, the price in January is $36.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. So, starting from $40 in November, an 80% increase. 80% of 40 is 32, so 40 + 32 is 72. Then, a 50% decrease from 72. 50% of 72 is 36, so 72 - 36 is 36. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as multiplying by the percentage. So, after the increase, the price is 1.8 times the original, and then after the decrease, it's 0.5 times the December price. So, 1.8 * 0.5 is 0.9, so the final price is 0.9 times the original November price. 

Let me check that. 0.9 * 40 is 36. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to think about it, which confirms that the final price is $36.

I think that makes sense. So, the toy started at $40, went up by 80%, which is a significant increase, and then went down by 50%, which brings it down to 90% of the December price. So, 90% of $72 is $6.30, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, I think I confused something.

Wait, no, actually, the December price is $72, and then it's decreased by 50%, so 50% of 72 is 36, so 72 - 36 is 36. So, that's correct. So, the final price is $36.

Wait, but 90% of $72 is 65.52, which is not 36. Wait, no, that's not the way. Wait, no, 1.8 times 0.5 is 0.9, so 0.9 times 40 is 36. So, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I confused the percentages. Let me think again. So, November is 40. Then, 80% increase: 40 * 1.8 = 72. Then, 50% decrease: 72 * 0.5 = 36. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think of
