Q: When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sophie and her nephew. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Sophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks. Hmm, wait, 31 blocks? That seems like a lot. Then there's a bin of stuffed animals with 8 of them. And a tower of stacking rings with 9 multicolored rings. So, that's 31 + 8 + 9. Let me add those up. 311? Wait, 31 plus 8 is 39, and 39 plus 9 is 48. So, the total number of toys before she bought the bouncy balls is 48.

Then, Sophie bought a tube of bouncy balls, and now her total number of toys for her nephew is 62. So, I need to find out how many bouncy balls she added. That means I need to subtract the original number of toys from the new total.

So, 62 total toys minus the original 48 toys. Let me do that subtraction. 62 minus 48. Hmm, 62 minus 40 is 22, and then minus 8 more is 14. So, 62 minus 48 is 14. That means Sophie added 14 bouncy balls into the tube.

Wait, let me double-check that. 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings is 31 + 8 = 39, plus 9 is 48. Then, 48 plus 14 is 62. Yeah, that adds up. So, 14 bouncy balls must be in the tube.

I think that's it. So, the answer is 14 bouncy balls.

**Final Answer**
The number of bouncy balls in the tube is \boxed{14}.

Sophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 multicolored rings. The total number of toys before Sophie bought the bouncy balls is calculated as follows:

\[
31 + 8 + 9 = 48
\]

After buying the tube of bouncy balls, the total number of toys becomes 62. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the original total from the new total:

\[
62 - 48 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \boxed{14}.
