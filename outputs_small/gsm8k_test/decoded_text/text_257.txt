Q: Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a redwood tree, and I need to figure out how much it weighs after the termites ate 30% of its wood. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says each solid 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Hmm, so each 10-foot piece is 400 pounds. That seems like a lot, but okay. Then, the redwood is 200 feet tall. So, I guess I need to figure out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree. That should be straightforward, right?

Let me calculate that. If each section is 10 feet, then 200 divided by 10 is... 22. So, there are 22 sections in the entire tree. Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight before the termites ate anything would be 22 multiplied by 400 pounds. Let me write that down:

Total weight before termites = 22 * 400 pounds.

Hmm, let me compute that. 22 times 400. Well, 20 times 400 is 8,800, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 22 is 20 plus 2, so 20*400 is 8,800, and 2*400 is 800, so adding those together gives 8,800 + 800 = 9,680 pounds. So, the total weight of the redwood is 9,680 pounds.

But then, the termites ate 30% of this wood. So, I need to find 33% of 9,680 pounds and subtract that from the total to get the remaining weight. Let me figure out how much 33% is in pounds.

First, let me convert 33% to a decimal, which is 0.33. Then, multiply that by 9,680 pounds.

So, 0.33 * 9,680. Hmm, let me compute that. 0.3 times 9,680 is 2,904, and 0.03 times 9,680 is 290.4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.33 is 0.3 + 0.03, so 0.3*9,680 is 2,904, and 0.03*9,680 is 290.4. So, adding those together, 2,904 + 290.4 is 3,194.4 pounds. So, the termites ate 3,194.4 pounds.

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is the total weight minus the amount eaten. So, 9,680 - 3,194.4. Let me subtract that. 9,680 minus 3,000 is 6,680, and then subtract 194.4 more, which gives 6,680 - 194.4 = 6,485.6 pounds.

Wait, let me double-check that subtraction. 9,680 minus 3,194.4. So, 9,680 minus 3,000 is 6,680, and then subtract 194.4, which is 6,680 - 194.4. Let me do that step by step. 6,680 minus 100 is 6,570, minus 84 is 6,486, minus 0.4 is 6,485.6. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the remaining weight is 6,485.6 pounds. But wait, the question is asking how much does it weigh, and it's probably better to round it to a reasonable decimal place. Since the original weights were given in whole numbers, maybe we can round to the nearest whole number. So, 6,485.6 is approximately 6,486 pounds.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.

First, the total height is 200 feet, each section is 10 feet. So, 22 sections. Each section is 400 pounds. So, 22*400. Let me
