Q: In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Roper's class, and I need to figure out how many students are leaving early. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

First, the class has 30 students, right? Wait, no, hold on, the problem says 30 students. Hmm, let me check: "In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students..." Yeah, that's correct. So, 30 students? Wait, no, 30. Wait, 30 or 33? Wait, no, the original problem says 30. Let me confirm: "30 students." So, 30. Okay, so 30 students in total.

Then, it says 20% of the class are football players. Okay, so I need to find 20% of 30 students. Let me calculate that. 20% is the same as 0.2 in decimal. So, 0.2 multiplied by 30. Let me do that: 0.2 * 30. Hmm, 0.2 times 30. Well, 0.2 is a tenth, so 30 divided by 100? Wait, no, 0.2 is 20%, so 20% of 30 is 0.2 * 33? Wait, no, 30 or 33? Wait, the class is 30 students. So, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 30 or 33? Wait, the problem says 30 students. So, 30. So, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 20% of 33 is 6.6, but we can't have a fraction of a student. Wait, maybe I misread the percentage.

Wait, the problem says 20% of the class are football players. So, 20% of 33? Wait, 33 is the number of students. So, 20% of 33 is 0.2 * 33, which is 6.6. Hmm, that's not a whole number. That can't be right. So, maybe the class is 30 students? Wait, the problem says 30 students. Wait, let me check again: "In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students..." So, 30 students. So, 20% of 30 is 6. So, 6 football players.

Okay, so 6 football players. Got that. So, 6 students are football players.

Then, it says, "Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band." Hmm, so after the football players, the remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students. So, 24 students left. Then, 25% of these 24 are cheerleaders or part of band. So, 25% of 24 is 6. So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of band.

So, now, the problem says these 3 groups of students will need to leave early. So, football players, cheerleaders, and band members. So, we need to add up these three groups.

So, football players: 6 students.

Cheerleaders or band: 6 students.

So, total students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

Wait, but hold on, is there any overlap? Like, could a student be both a football player and a cheerleader or band member? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that. It just says these 3 groups. So, unless specified, we can assume that these groups are distinct. So, no overlap. So, 6 football players, 6 cheerleaders, 6 band members, totaling 12 students.

So, the answer should be 12 students.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes percentages can be tricky.

First, 20% of 30 students: 0.2 * 33. Wait, hold on, 33? Wait, the class is 30 students. So, 20% of 33? Wait, no, 20% of 33 is 6.6, which is not a whole number. So, that can't be. So, maybe the class is 30 students. So, 20% of 30 is 6
