Q: Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. I need to find out how many books Fawn has. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably assign variables to each person's number of books to make it easier to work with. Let me call the number of books Fawn has "F". Then, since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne must have F - 12 books. That makes sense because if Fawn has more, Anne has less by 12.

Now, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Since Anne has F - 12 books, Sofie must have (F - 12) + 25 books. Let me write that down: Sofie = F - 12 + 25. Simplifying that, F -12 +25 is F -7. So, Sofie has F -7 books.

Alright, so now I have expressions for each person's number of books in terms of F. Let me write them all out:

- Fawn: F books
- Anne: F - 12 books
- Sofie: F -7 books

Now, the total number of books they have together is 85. So, if I add up all their books, it should equal 85. That gives me the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 7) = 85

Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, I'll remove the parentheses:

F + F - 12 + F -7 = 85

Now, combine like terms. There are three F terms: F + F + F, which is 3F. Then, the constants are -12 and -7. Adding those together: -12 -7 is -19.

So, the equation simplifies to:

3F - 19 = 85

Wait, hold on, let me check that. 3F minus 19 equals 85? Hmm, let me make sure I combined the constants correctly. So, starting with F + F -12 + F -7. So, F + F is 2F, then 2F -12 + F -7. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in combining the terms.

Wait, let me go back. The original expression is F + (F -12) + (F -7). So, that's F + F -12 + F -7. So, combining the F terms: F + F + F is 3F. Then, the constants: -12 -7 is -9. So, 3F -9 =85. Wait, so earlier I thought it was -19, but that's incorrect. It's -9.

So, the equation is 3F -9 =85.

Now, I need to solve for F. Let me add 9 to both sides to get rid of the -9 on the left.

3F -9 +9 =85 +9

Which simplifies to:

3F =94

Wait, 85 +9 is 94, right? So, 3F =94.

Now, to find F, I need to divide both sides by 3.

F =94 /3

Hmm, 94 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 3 goes into 9 three times, with no remainder. Then, bring down the 4. 3 goes into 4 once, with a remainder of 1. So, 94 divided by3 is 31 with a remainder of1, which is 31.333...

Wait, but that can't be right because the number of books should be a whole number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me go back and check my steps.

Starting again: Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. Sofie has 25 more than Anne, Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn.

Let me define Fawn's books as F. Then, Anne has F -12. Sofie has (F -12) +25, which is F -12 +25, which is F -7. So, that part seems correct.

So, total books: F + (F -12) + (F -7) =85.

Simplify: F + F -12 + F -7 =85.

Combine like terms: 3F -19=85? Wait, hold on,
