Q: Andy works in the pro shop of a tennis resort. He has 12 racquets that need restringing. 3 of them are to be strung with synthetic gut, 5 of them will be strung with polyester string, and 4 of them will be strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string). How long will it take Andy to string all of those racquets if it takes him an average of 15 minutes for him to string with synthetic gut, 22 minutes to string with polyester string, and 18 minutes for hybrid sets?

Okay, so I have this problem where Andy is at a tennis resort and he needs to restring 12 racquets. The racquets are divided into three categories: 3 need synthetic gut, 5 need polyester string, and 4 need hybrid sets. Each type of stringing takes a different amount of time: synthetic gut takes 15 minutes, polyester takes 22 minutes, and hybrid sets take 18 minutes. I need to figure out how long it will take Andy to string all of them.

First, I should probably break this down by each type of stringing. Let me list out the numbers:

- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets
- Polyester: 5 racquets
- Hybrid: 4 racquets

Now, for each category, I can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of racquets by the time it takes to string each one. That makes sense because if he has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut and each takes 15 minutes, the total time for synthetic gut would be 3 times 15 minutes.

Let me write that out:

Synthetic gut time = 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet
Polyester time = 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet
Hybrid time = 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet

Calculating each:

Synthetic gut: 3 * 15. Hmm, 15 times 3 is 45. So that's 45 minutes.

Polyester: 5 *22. Let me think, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 2 is 10, so 100 +10 is 150. So that's 150 minutes.

Hybrid: 4 *18. 18 times 4 is 72. So that's 72 minutes.

Now, to find the total time, I need add up all these times together. So:

Total time = 45 + 150 + 72

Let me add 45 and 150 first. 45 + 150 is 195. Then, add 72 to that. 195 +72. Let's see, 195 +70 is 265, and then +2 is 267. So total time is 267 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Synthetic gut: 3 *15. 15*3 is 45. That's correct.

Polyester: 5*22. 22*5 is 110. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 150, but 22*5 is 110. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate.

Polyester: 5 *22. 22*5 is 110. So that's 110 minutes.

Hybrid: 4*18. Wait, no, 4*18 is 32? Wait, no, 18*4 is 72. So that's correct.

So, recalculating total time:

45 (synthetic) + 110 (polyester) +72 (hybrid)

45 +111 is 156, then +72 is 228. Wait, that's different. So earlier I thought 5*22 was 150, but actually it's 110. So that changes the total.

Wait, so let me recast the entire problem.

Synthetic: 3*15=45

Polyester:5*22=1100? Wait, 22*5 is 110. So 110.

Hybrid:4*18=72.

So total time is 45 +110 +72.

45 +11 is 56, plus 72 is 128. Wait, no, 45 +111 is 56, plus 72 is 128? Wait, 56 +72 is 128? Wait, 56 +72 is 128? Wait, 56 +70 is 126, plus 2 is 128. Hmm, that seems high.

Wait, but 45 +111 is 56, plus 72 is 128. Hmm, 128 minutes. But that seems a bit long. Let me check again.

Wait, 3*15 is 45
