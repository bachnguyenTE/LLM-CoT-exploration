Q: Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate Ryan's total allowance by multiplying his weekly allowance by the number of weeks he completed his chores.

Next, determine the total amount spent on buying ice cream cones for himself and his three friends. Multiply the number of people by the cost per ice cream cone.

Subtract the total ice cream expenses from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left.

Finally, divide the remaining money by the cost of each movie ticket to find out how many tickets he can afford.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Ryan's Total Allowance:**
   
   Ryan receives \$6 each week for completing chores.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Allowance} = \$6 \times 3 \text{ weeks} = \$18
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Amount Spent on Ice Cream:**
   
   Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, totaling 4 people.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Ice Cream Cost} = 4 \times \$1.250 = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Find the Remaining Money After Buying Ice Cream:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = \$18 - \$5.00 = \$13.00
   \]

4. **Calculate How Many Movie Tickets Ryan Can Buy:**
   
   Each movie ticket costs \$6.50.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Movie Tickets} = \frac{\$13.00}{\$6.50} = 2
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
