Q: The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. How much will it cost to fill the pool?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is rectangular, so the volume is length multiplied by width multiplied by depth.

Next, I'll convert the dimensions from feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons, I'll multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the total gallons of water needed.

Finally, to determine the cost, I'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10 per gallon.

**Solution:**

To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**

   The pool is rectangular, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
   \]
   
   Given:
   \[
   \text{Length} = 25 \text{ feet}, \quad \text{Width} = 14 \text{ feet}, \quad \text{Depth} = 4 \text{ feet}
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert Cubic Feet to Gallons:**

   Since 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10533.6 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost:**

   The cost per gallon is \$0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 10533.6 \times 0.10 = \$1053.36
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1053.36}
\]
