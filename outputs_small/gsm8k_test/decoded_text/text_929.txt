Q: A bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. How much farther did the bus go than the car, in miles?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where a bus is traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, and a car is going at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. I need to figure out how much farther the bus went compared to the car. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for both the bus and the car, I can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Alright, let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the bus: it's going 60 miles per hour. Wait, hold on, 60? That seems a bit odd. Is that 60 miles per hour or is it a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be 60 miles per hour, which is 60 mph. Yeah, that makes more sense. So, the bus's speed is 60 mph, and it's traveling for 5 hours. So, the distance the bus covers would be 60 multiplied by 5.

Let me write that down:

Distance_bus = 60 mph × 5 hours

Hmm, 60 times 5. Let me calculate that. 60 times 5 is 300, right? Because 60 is 60, so 60 × 5 is 330. Wait, no, 60 × 5 is actually 330? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300, because 60 × 5 is 330. Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 330? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300, and 6 × 5 is 30, so 300 + 30 is 330. Yeah, that's correct. So, the bus went 330 miles.

Now, moving on to the car: it's going 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance the car covers is:

Distance_car = 30 mph × 8 hours

Calculating that: 30 × 8. Hmm, 30 times 8 is 240. So, the car went 240 miles.

Now, the question is asking how much farther the bus went than the car. So, I need to subtract the distance of the car from the distance of the bus.

Difference = Distance_bus - Distance_car

Plugging in the numbers:

Difference = 330 miles - 240 miles

Wait, 330 minus 240. Let me do that subtraction. 330 minus 240. So, 330 minus 200 is 130, and then minus 40 more is 90. So, 330 - 240 is 90.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 330 minus 240. Let me write it down:

330
-240
-----
90

Yes, that's correct. So, the bus went 90 miles farther than the car.

Wait, but hold on, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with the numbers.

First, the bus: 60 mph for 5 hours. 60 × 5. 60 × 5 is 300, right? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 330. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 60 × 5: 60 is 60, so 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, no, 60 × 5 is 330. Wait, 60 × 5 is 300, plus 60 × 5 is 300, so 300 + 300 is 600? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, 60 × 5: 60 × 5 is 300? Wait, 60 × 5 is 330? Wait, 60 × 5: 60 × 5 is 330. Wait, 60 × 5 is 330? Wait, 60
