Q: Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Joe's Halloween candy bag. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Joe has a bag with 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. It also mentions that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. The question is asking how much the entire bag of candy weighs in grams.

Alright, let's break this down. I need to find the total weight of all the candies in the bag. That means I need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Starting with the chocolate bars. It says there are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs twice as much as a candied apple. But wait, it also gives the weight of each chocolate bar directly: 40 grams. Hmm, so maybe I don't need to calculate the weight of each candied apple first? That might save some steps.

Let me think. If each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple, then each candied apple must weigh half of 40 grams. Let me write that down:

Weight of each candied apple = (Weight of each chocolate bar) / 2
So, that would be 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

Wait, so each candied apple is 20 grams? That seems reasonable. Let me double-check. If each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple, and the bar is 40g, then the apple must be half of that, which is 20g. Yep, that makes sense.

Now, moving on to the total weight of all the chocolate bars. There are 25 of them, each weighing 40 grams. So, total weight for chocolate bars is 25 multiplied by 40 grams.

Let me calculate that: 25 * 40. Hmm, 25 times 40. Well, 25 times 4 is 100, so 25 times 40 is 1000 grams. Wait, is that right? Let me verify. 40 times 25: 40*20 is 800, and 40*5 is 200, so 800 + 200 is 1000. Wait, hold on, that's 1000 grams. Hmm, so 25*40 is 1000 grams. Okay, that seems correct.

Now, onto the candied apples. There are 80 of them, each weighing 20 grams. So, total weight for candied apples is 80 multiplied by 20 grams.

Calculating that: 80 * 20. Well, 80*20 is 1760, but wait, 80*20 is 1600. Let me think. 80*20 is the same as 8*2*10*10, which is 16*100, which is 1600. So, 1600 grams.

Wait, hold on, 80*20 is 1600, but here it's 80*20, so yeah, 1600 grams. Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600. Wait, 80*20 is 1600. So, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, 80*20: 80*20. Let me do it step by step. 80*20: 80*20 is 1760? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1760? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 80*20: 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*20 is 1600. Wait, 80*20 is 1600? Wait, no, 80*2
