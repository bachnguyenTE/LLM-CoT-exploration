Q: Deandre caught 3 tunas last Monday, the first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna he caught weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna he caught weighs 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to the market?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total weight of the tuna Deandre caught. He caught three tunas with weights of 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms.

Next, I'll add these weights together to find the total weight of the tuna. 

After obtaining the total weight, I'll calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram, which is $0.50.

Finally, I'll present the total earnings as the final answer.

**Solution:**

Deandre caught three tunas with the following weights:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the tuna.**

\[
\text{Total weight} = 56\,000 + 46,000 + 26,000 = 128\,000\,kg
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total earnings from selling the tuna.**

The cost per kilogram of tuna is \$0.50.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 128\,000 \times 0.50 = 64\,000\,\text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{64000}
\]
