Okay, so Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa. He wants to figure out how much he can spend on gifts for his business partners after he buys all his other expenses. Let me break this down step by step.

First, Theo buys 6 business suits, each costing $100. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the suits. That would be 6 multiplied by $100. Let me write that down:

6 suits * $100/suit = $600.

Alright, so the business suits cost $600 in total.

Next, he buys 3 suitcases at $50 each. Let me calculate that:

3 suitcases * $50/suit = $150.

So, the suitcases cost $150 in total.

Now, he also buys a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Hmm, okay, let's parse that. First, find 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each suit is $100, 5 times that would be:

5 * $100 = $500.

Then, the flight ticket costs $700 more than that. So, we add $700 to $550:

$550 + $700 = $1250.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 5 times $100 is $500, plus $700 is indeed $1200. Wait, no, 500 + 700 is 1200. So, the flight ticket is $1200.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure. The problem says the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. So, 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * 100 = 500. Then, add 700 to that: 500 + 700 = 1200. So, the flight ticket is $1200.

Wait, that seems correct. So, the flight ticket is $1200.

So, now let's add up all his expenses: business suits, suitcases, flight ticket.

Total spent on business suits: $600

Total spent on suitcases: $150

Total spent on flight ticket: $1200

So, adding those together: 600 + 150 = 750, then 750 + 1200 = 1950.

So, Theo has already spent $1950 on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket.

But wait, the question says he wishes to spend $2000 for this trip. So, he has $6000 initially. He wants to spend $2000 on the trip, so he needs to save $2000 for gifts. Wait, no, actually, let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "he wishes to spend $2000 for this trip." So, he wants to save $2000 for gifts. So, he has $6000, he spends some on business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and wants to save $2000. So, the amount he has to spend on gifts is the remaining amount after subtracting the expenses from his initial $6000.

Wait, but hold on, let me clarify. The question is: "how much does he have to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa?" So, he has $6000, he spends some on business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and wants to save $2000. So, the amount he has to spend on gifts is the total he has minus the amount he spends on business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket, minus the amount he wants to save.

Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The total he has is $6000. He wants to spend $2000 on the trip, so he needs to save $2000. So, the amount he can spend on business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

But wait, that can't be right because he already spent more than that on business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket. So, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, maybe the question is: he has $6000, he wants to spend $2000 on the trip, so he needs to save $200
