Q: A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a food caterer preparing hot dogs for a party. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I take it slowly, I think I can figure it out.

First, the problem says: "A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests." So, initially, there are 36 guests. Now, most people would only eat one hotdog, but the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. Hmm, okay, so half of 36 is 18, right? So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 18 guests to have two each. That means he prepared 18 times 2, which is 36 hotdogs. Wait, that's the same number as the number of guests. So, he prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests, each getting two. But then, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, 40 guests wanted two each. Wait, hold on, 40 guests wanting two each would require 40 times 2, which is 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs. That seems like a lot. So, how many guests didn't get a second hotdog?

Let me try to visualize this. Initially, the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two each, so 36 hotdogs. Then, 40 guests came, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, 40 guests wanted two each, which is 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only had 36 hotdogs. So, the question is, how many guests didn't get a second hotdog.

Wait, maybe I need to think about how many hotdogs were actually consumed. So, the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests (half of 36). Then, 40 guests came, and each wanted a second hotdog. So, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 times 2, which is 80. But the caterer only had 36 hotdogs. So, 80 minus 36 is 44. So, 44 hotdogs were not consumed. But the question is, how many guests didn't get a second hotdog.

Wait, maybe I need to think about how many guests got a second hotdog. So, the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two each, so 18 guests had two each, and the remaining 18 guests had one each. So, 18 guests had two, and 18 guests had one. Then, 40 guests came, so 18 + 18 = 36 guests. Wait, but 40 guests came, so 40 minus 36 is 4 guests who didn't come? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the initial preparation. The caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two each, so 36 hotdogs. Then, 40 guests came, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, 40 guests wanted two each, which is 80 hotdogs. But the caterer only had 36 hotdogs. So, 80 minus 36 is 44 hotdogs were not consumed. But how does that translate to guests not getting a second hotdog?

Wait, maybe I need to think about how many guests actually got a second hotdog. So, the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests to have two each. So, 18 guests had two each, and the remaining 18 guests had one each. So, 18 guests had two, and 18 guests had one. So, 18 + 18 = 36 guests. But 40 guests came, so 40 minus 36 is 4 guests who didn't come. But the question is, how many guests didn't get a second hotdog. So, maybe the 4 guests who didn't come didn't get a second hotdog, but also, the 18 guests who had one each didn't get a second hotdog. So, total guests who didn't get a second hotdog is 18 + 4 = 22.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.

Wait, the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two each, so 36 hotdogs. Then, 40 guests came, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. So, 40 guests wanted two each, which
