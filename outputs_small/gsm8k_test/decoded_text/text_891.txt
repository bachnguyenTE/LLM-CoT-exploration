Q: A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about whirligigs, thingamabobs, and whatchamacallits. It seems like it's about speed and ratios. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says: "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." Hmm, okay. So, if I let the speed of a thingamabob be some value, then the whirligig is five times that. Got it.

Next, it says: "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, similar to the thingamabob, but this time it's a whatchamacallit. So, the speed of a whatchamacallit is eleven times the speed of a thingamabob.

Then, it gives the speed of a whatchamacallit: "A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second." So, that's 121 m/s. Cool.

And the question is: "How fast does a whirligig spin?" So, we need to find the speed of the whirligig.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me call the speed of a thingamabob as T. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit would be 11*T, which is 11T, or 11T. And the speed of the whirligig is 5 times the speed of a thingamabob, so that would be 5T.

But we know the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 m/s. Since the whatchamacallit is 11T, we can set up an equation: 11T = 121 m/s.

So, to find T, we can divide both sides by 11. That would give T = 121 / 11. Let me compute that. 121 divided by 11 is 11. So, T is 11 m/s.

Wait, hold on. 121 divided by 11 is 11? Wait, 11 times 11 is 121, right? So, yes, 121 divided by 11 is 11. So, T is 11 m/s.

So, the thingamabob spins at 11 m/s. Then, the whatchamacallit is 11 times that, so 11*11 m/s. Let me compute that. 11*11 is 121. So, the whatchamacallit is 121 m/s.

But wait, the problem is asking for the speed of the whirligig. The whirligig is five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, that would be 5*T, which is 5*11 m/s. 5*11 is 55. So, the whirligig is spinning at 55 m/s.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. So, if the thingamabob is 11 m/s, then the whatchamacallit is 11 times that, which is 121 m/s. Then, the whirligig is five times the thingamabob, so 5*11 m/s is 55 m/s. That seems consistent.

But let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says: whirligig is five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, if T is the speed of a thingamabob, then whirligig is 5T. Whatchamacallit is 11T, and that's given as 121 m/s. So, 11T = 121, so T = 11. Then, 5T is 55. So, yes, 55 m/s.

Wait, but 5 times 11 is 55, and 11 times 11 is 121. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of ratios. The speed of the whatchamacallit is 11 times the thingamabob, and the speed of the whirligig is 5 times the thingamabob. So, the ratio of speeds between the whatchamacallit and the whirligig would be 11T : 5T, which simplifies to 11:55, or 11:55. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11T is 11 times T, and 5T is 5 times T. So, the ratio of the wh
