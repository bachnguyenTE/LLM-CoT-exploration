Okay, so I need to figure out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. That means on each of those days, he drinks one glass. But on the weekends, specifically on Saturday and Sunday, he likes to relax and have a soda instead of water. So, on Saturday and Sunday, he doesn't drink water; he drinks soda.

Wait, hold on. The problem says he has one glass of water before he goes to bed. So, does that mean he drinks water before bed, which is the same as before he leaves for work or school? So, if he has breakfast, lunch, and dinner, that's three times a day, and then before bed, which is another time. So, that would be four times a day, right? Because breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed.

But then, on weekends, he has a soda instead of water. So, on Saturday and Sunday, he doesn't drink water, but he still has breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, does that mean he drinks water three times a day on weekends as well? Or does he have a soda instead of water?

Wait, let me parse the problem again. It says, "John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well." So, that seems to suggest that before bed, he has a glass of water. So, that's an additional time when he drinks water.

So, on weekdays, he has breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. That's four times a day. But on weekends, he has breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but instead of water, he has a soda. So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water, but he still has breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

So, let me break it down:

- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 4 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, before bed). So, 4 glasses of water each day.

- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner). But instead of water, he has soda. So, he doesn't drink water on weekends.

Therefore, in a week, how many glasses of water does he drink?

Let me calculate:

- 5 weekdays: 4 glasses each day. So, 5 * 4 = 20 glasses.

- 2 weekend days: 0 glasses each day. So, 2 *0 =0 glasses.

Total glasses of water in a week: 20 + 0 =20.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, "John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well." So, that's four times a day on weekdays, and three times a day on weekends.

But on weekends, instead of water, he has soda. So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water, but he still has breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, on weekends, he drinks three glasses of water? Wait, no. Wait, no, he doesn't drink water on weekends. He drinks soda instead. So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water at all.

Wait, so on weekdays, he drinks 4 glasses each day, and on weekends, he drinks 0 glasses. So, total is 5*4 + 2*0 =20.

But let me think again. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see.

Each day, he has breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. So, that's four times a day. So, 4 glasses on weekdays. On weekends, he still has breakfast, lunch, dinner, but instead of water, he has soda. So, he doesn't drink water on weekends.

Therefore, on weekends, he drinks 0 glasses. So, total is 5*4 + 2*0 =20.

Wait, but the problem says, "John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead." So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water, but he still has dinner with soda. So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water, but he still has dinner.

So, on weekdays, he drinks 4 glasses each day, and on weekends, he doesn't drink water at all. So, total is 5*4 + 2*0 =20.

Wait, but let me think about the wording again. It says, "John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Finally, he has one before he goes to bed as well." So, that
