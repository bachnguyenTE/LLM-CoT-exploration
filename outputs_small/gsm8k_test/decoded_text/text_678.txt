Q: Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. How much does Karen earn in two days if she works 3 hours per day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine Karen's hourly wage by doubling Lorie's rate. Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns $20 per hour.

Next, calculate Karen's earnings for two days of work. She works 3 hours each day, so she works a total of 6 hours over two days.

Finally, multiply her hourly wage by the total number of hours worked to find her total earnings. Karen earns $120 in two days.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Karen's hourly wage:**
   
   Lorie earns \$10 per hour.
   
   Karen earns twice what Lorie earns.
   
   \[
   \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate Karen's earnings for two days:**
   
   - **Hours worked per day:** 3 hours
   - **Total hours over two days:** \( 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ hours} \)
   
   - **Total earnings:** 
     
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Karen's hourly wage} \times \text{Total hours} = \$20 \times 6 = \$120
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$120}
\]
