Q: John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.  He gets paid $25 an hour.  If his car payment is $500, how much profit does he make on his car?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much profit John makes from renting his car each month. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, John rents his car out 10 times a month. Each time, he gets 3 hours of rental. So, I should calculate the total number of hours he's renting the car in a month. That would be 10 times 3 hours. Let me write that down:

Total hours per month = 10 * 3 = 30 hours.

Alright, so he gets 30 hours of rental each month. Now, he gets paid $25 an hour. So, I need to find out how much he earns from these 30 hours. That would be:

Total earnings = 30 hours * $25/hour.

Hmm, let me calculate that. 30 times 25. Well, 30 times 20 is 660, and 30 times 5 is 155, so adding those together gives 660 + 155 = 815. So, he earns $815 from the car rental each month.

But wait, he also has a car payment of $500. So, his total cost for the car each month is $500. To find his profit, I need to subtract his total cost from his total earnings.

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost.

So, that would be:

Profit = $815 - $500.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a typo there. 30 times 25 is 815, right? So, $815. Then subtract $500.

So, $815 - $500. Let me do that subtraction. 815 minus 500. 815 minus 500. Hmm, 815 minus 500 is 315. So, the profit is $315.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Total hours: 10 times 3 hours is 30 hours. 30 times 25 is 815. Then subtract the car payment of 500, which gives 315. Yeah, that seems right.

So, John makes a profit of $315 each month from renting his car.

**Final Answer**
John makes a profit of \boxed{315} dollars each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. To find the total number of hours he rents the car in a month, we calculate:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
\]

He earns $25 per hour, so his total earnings from the car rental are:

\[
30 \times 25 = 815 \text{ dollars}
\]

His car payment is $500 per month. To find his profit, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings:

\[
815 - 500 = 315 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, John makes a profit of \boxed{315} dollars each month.
