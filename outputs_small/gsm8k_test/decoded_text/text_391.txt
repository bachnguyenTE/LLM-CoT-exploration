Q: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Betty and Sam have a ratio of popsicles, 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles. I need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare quantities. So, if Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts, the total number of parts is 5 + 6, which is 11 parts. That makes sense because 5:6 is like saying for every 5 Betty has, Sam has 6.

Now, the total number of popsicles is 165. So, these 165 popsicles are divided into 11 parts, right? So, each part must be equal. To find out how many popsicles each part is worth, I can divide the total number by the number of parts. That would be 165 divided by 11.

Let me do that calculation: 165 ÷ 11. Hmm, 11 times 15 is 55, which is less than 165. Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, that can't be right because 11 times 15 is 55, not 165. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 11 times 15 is 165? Let me check: 11 times 10 is 110, 11 times 15 is 165. Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? That doesn't make sense because 11 times 10 is 110, and 11 times 5 is 55, so 110 + 55 is 165. Wait, so 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, that seems too high because 11 times 15 is 165. Wait, no, 11 times 15 is 165? Wait, 11 times 10 is 110, 11 times 5 is 55, so 110 + 55 is 165. So, 11 times 15 is 165. So, each part is 15 popsicles.

Wait, so each part is 15 popsicles. So, Betty has 5 parts, which is 5 times 15, which is 75 popsicles. And Sam has 6 parts, which is 6 times 15, which is 90 popsicles. So, Sam has 90 popsicles and Betty has 75 popsicles. So, how many more does Sam have than Betty? That would be 90 minus 75, which is 15.

Wait, so the answer is 15? Let me just double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, the ratio is 5:6, which adds up to 11 parts. Total popsicles are 165, so each part is 165 divided by 11, which is 15. So, Betty has 5 times 15, which is 75, and Sam has 6 times 15, which is 90. 90 minus 75 is 15. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as fractions. The ratio of Betty to Sam is 5/11 to 6/11, so Betty has 5/11 of the total, and Sam has 6/1. So, the total is 11/1, so 5/11 + 6/11 is 11/1, which is 165. So, Betty has 5/11 divided by 11, which is 5/11 times 1/1, which is 5/11, which is 5/11 of the total. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of fractions. The total is 165. So, Betty has 5 parts, which is 5/11 of the total, so 5/11 times 165 is 5 times
