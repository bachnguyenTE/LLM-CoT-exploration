Q: Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. If each pail contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he get every day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Baldur getting water from a well. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Each pail contains 5 liters of water. I need to find out how many liters of water he gets every day.

Hmm, okay. So, he gets water twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Each time, he gets a certain number of pails, and each pail is 5 liters. So, I think I need to calculate the total liters he gets in the morning and then add the total liters he gets in the afternoon, and then sum those two amounts together.

Let me write that down. In the morning, he gets 5 pails. Each pail is 5 liters, so the total liters in the morning would be 5 pails multiplied by 5 liters per pail. That should be 5 * 5. Let me calculate that: 5 times 5 is 25. So, he gets 25 liters in the morning.

Then, in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails. Again, each pail is 5 liters. So, the total liters in the afternoon would be 6 pails multiplied by 5 liters per pail. That's 6 * 5. Let me do that multiplication: 6 times 5 is 30. Wait, no, 6 times 5 is 30? Wait, no, 6 times 5 is 30? Wait, no, 6 times 5 is 30. Wait, hold on, 5 times 6 is 30. Yeah, that's right. So, he gets 30 liters in the afternoon.

Now, to find the total liters he gets every day, I need to add the morning and afternoon amounts together. So, 25 liters in the morning plus 30 liters in the afternoon. Let me add those: 25 + 30. Hmm, 25 plus 30 is 55. So, altogether, he gets 55 liters of water every day.

Wait, let me double-check that. Morning: 5 pails, each 5 liters, so 5*5=25 liters. Afternoon:6 pails, each 5 liters, so 6*5=30 liters. Total:25+30=55 liters. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so that's 5+6=11 pails in total. Each pail is 5 liters, so 11 pail is 5 liters, so 11 pails would be 11*5=55 liters. That's another way to look at it and still gets me 55 liters. So, that confirms it.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward: add the morning and afternoon pails, multiply each by 5 liters, then add the totals. So, 5+6=11 pail, 1*5=55 liters. Yep, that's solid.

I guess another way to think about it is, how many pails does he get each day? 5 in the morning and 6 in the afternoon, so 5+6=11 pail. Each pail is 5 liters, so 11*5=55 liters. Same answer.

So, I think I'm confident that the total liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters.

**Final Answer**
Baldur gets \boxed{55} liters of water every day.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon. Each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find the total liters of water he gets every day, we can break it down as follows:

1. Calculate the liters of water in the morning:
   \[
   5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 25 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Calculate the liters of water in the afternoon:
   \[
   6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. Add the liters from the morning and the afternoon together:
   \[
   25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, Baldur gets \boxed{55} liters of water every day.
