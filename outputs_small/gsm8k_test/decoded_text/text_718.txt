Q: 100 people apply for a job at Google. Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?

Okay, so I have this problem here about 100 people applying for a job at Google. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many people end up accepting the position. Hmm, let's see.

First, it says 30% of the applicants receive interviews. So, if there are 100 people applying, 30% of 100 should be the number of people who get interviews. Let me calculate that. 30% of 100 is 0.3 times 100, which is 33. So, 33 people get interviews.

Alright, next part: Of those who receive interviews, 20% get a job offer. So, 20% of 33 people. Let me compute that. 0.2 times 33 is... 6.6. Wait, that's 6.6 people? Hmm, but you can't have a fraction of a person, right? Maybe I should keep it as a decimal for now and see if it makes sense later.

So, 6.6 people get a job offer. Now, of those who receive a job offer, a third accept the position. So, 1/3 of 6.6 is... Let me calculate that. 6.6 divided by 3 is 2.2. Hmm, so about 2.2 people accept the position. But again, you can't have a fraction of a person. So, maybe I need to adjust my numbers or see if the problem expects an approximate answer.

Wait, maybe I should work with exact numbers instead of approximate percentages. Let me try that again.

Starting with 100 people. 30% get interviews. 33 people. Then, 20% of those 33 get a job offer. 20% of 33 is 6.6, which is 6 and two-thirds. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects an exact answer, so perhaps I should use fractions instead of decimals.

Let me try that. 30% is 33 people, which is 33. Then, 20% of 33 is 6.6, which is 6 and 2/3. So, 6 and 2/3 people get a job offer. Then, a third of those accept the position. So, 1/3 of 6 and 2/3 is... Let me compute that.

6 and 2/3 divided by 3 is 2 and 2/9. So, 2 and 2/9 people accept the position. Hmm, that's still a fraction. Maybe the problem expects an exact fractional answer, but in the context of people, you can't have a fraction. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the percentages.

Wait, let me double-check. 30% of 100 is 30, so 33 people. 20% of 33 is 6.6, which is 6 and 2/3. Then, a third of that is 2 and 2/9. So, 2 and 2/9 is approximately 2.222... So, about 2.22 people. But since you can't have a fraction of a person, maybe the answer is 2 people? Or maybe 3? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify rounding, so maybe it's okay to have a fractional answer.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position." So, if 6.6 people get a job offer, a third of them is 2.2 people. So, 2.2 people accept. But since you can't have a fraction, maybe the answer is 2 or 3. But in the context of the problem, maybe it's okay to have a decimal.

Wait, but let me see if I can represent this as fractions. 30% is 33, which is 33. 20% of 33 is 6.6, which is 6 and 2/3. Then, a third of 6 and 2/3 is 2 and 2/9. So, 2 and 2/9 is the exact number. So, 2 and 2/9 is approximately 2.222. people. So, if I have to write it as a fraction, it's 22/10, but wait, 2 and 2/9 is 20/9. So, 20/9 is 2.222... So, 20/9 is the exact number.

But the problem is asking how many people accept
