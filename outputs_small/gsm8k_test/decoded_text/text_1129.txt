Q: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painting Easter eggs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs. So, that's 56 eggs in total. Got that. 

Next, it says Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Hmm, so Arnold = Madeline. Let me note that down. Maybe I can use variables to represent the number of eggs each person painted. Let's say A for Arnold, M for Madeline, C for Camden, and S for Sarah. So, A = M. That seems straightforward.

Then, it says that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Wait, hold on, 30? That seems like a typo because 33 is more likely. Let me check the original problem again. It says "Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah." Yeah, 30 is correct. So, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. Okay, so that's two equations.

So, summarizing the information:

1. A + M + C + S = 56
2. A = M
3. C + S = 30
4. C = S + 12

Wait, hold on, 30? That seems like a lot because 30 eggs in total. But 56 is the total. Let me see. If C + S = 30, and C = S +12, then substituting equation 4 into equation 3, we get:

(S +12) + S = 30

So, 2S +12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18

Divide by 2: S = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Then, since C = S +12, that would be 9 +12 =21. So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Wait, but if C is 21 and S is 9, then C + S = 30, which matches the given information. Okay, that seems correct.

Now, going back to equation 1: A + M + C + S =56

But since A = M, we can write this as 2A + C + S =56

We already know C + S =30, so substituting that in:

2A +30 =56

So, 2A =26

Divide by 2: A=13

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and since A = M, Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

So, now the question is: How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?

Camden painted 21 eggs, Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, 21 -13=18.

So, Camden painted 18 more eggs than Arnold.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, C + S =30, and C = S +12. So, S =9, C=21. 9+21=30. That's correct.

Then, A + M =56 -30=26. Since A=M, each painted 13 eggs. 13+13=26. That adds up.

So, 21 -13=8. So, 8 more eggs.

Wait, but hold on, 21 is 21, which is 21 eggs? Wait, no, 21 is 21, but in the problem, the total is 56. So, 13+13+21+9=56? Wait, 13+13=26, 21+9=10, 26+10=36. Wait, that's only 36. But the total is supposed to be 56. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back.

Wait, the total eggs painted are 56. So, A + M + C + S=56.

But if A = M, then 2A + C + S=56.

But earlier, I thought C + S=30, which is way more than 56. That can't be right. So, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, the problem says "Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30
