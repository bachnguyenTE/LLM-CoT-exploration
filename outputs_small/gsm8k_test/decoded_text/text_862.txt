Q: Every hour, Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven.  Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices and wrapped individually for sale.  Each slice is sold for 50 cents for a fundraiser.  If she baked from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM straight, and sold all the slices, how much did she raise in dollars?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Paige raised by baking banana bread and selling the slices. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's see how long she baked. She started at 1:00 PM and ended at 6:00 PM. Hmm, so that's from 1:00 to 6:00. Let me count the hours. From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is one hour, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is two hours, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is three hours, 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is four hours, and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM is five hours. Wait, no, that's five hours, but actually, from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is five hours because 6:00 PM minus 1:00 PM is five hours. Let me double-check that. 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is one hour, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is two, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is three, 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is four, and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM is five. Yeah, that's five hours. So she baked for five hours.

Now, every hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. So in five hours, how many loaves does she bake? That should be 2 loaves/hour multiplied by 5 hours. Let me calculate that: 2 * 5 = 10. So she baked 10 banana bread loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, for each loaf, 8 slices. So, if she has 10 loaves, how many slices does she have in total? That would be 10 loaves * 8 slices per loaf. Let me compute that: 10 * 8 = 80. So, she has 80 slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, each slice is $0.50. To find the total amount she raised, I need to multiply the number of slices by the price per slice. That would be 80 slices * $0.500 per slice. Let me calculate that: 80 * 0.50 = 40. So, she raised $40.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. 2 loaves per hour, so 2*5=10 loaves. Each loaf into 8 slices, so 10*8=80 slices. Each slice is 50 cents, so 80*0.50=40. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves. 10 loaves * 8 slices = 80 slices. 80 slices * $0.50 = $40. Yep, same result.

I don't think I missed anything here. She baked continuously from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, so 5 hours, 2 loaves each hour, 8 slices each, each slice sold for 50 cents. So, 5*2=10 loaves, 10 slices, 10*0.50=5.50, wait, hold on, that's a different number. Wait, no, 10 slices at 50 cents each would be 10*0.50=5.50? That can't be right because 10*0.50 is 5.50, but earlier I got 40.00. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me recalculate. 10 slices at 50 cents each: 10 * 0.50. 10 * 0.50 is 5.00, which is $5.00. But earlier, I thought it was 80 slices. Wait, no, 10 slices would be 10 * 0.50 = 5.00. But that contradicts the previous calculation.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake in the number of slices. Let me go back.

She baked for 5 hours, 2 loaves per hour, so
