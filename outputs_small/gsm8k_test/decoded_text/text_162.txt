Q: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Okay, so I have this problem here about marbles. Let me read it again: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months? Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, the original price is $20. Every two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price. Wait, hold on, is that 20% of the original price or 20% of the current price? The wording says "20% of the original price," so I think that means 20% of the original price, not 20% of the current price. So, every two months, the price goes up by 20% of $20.

Let me write that down. The original price, P₀, is $20. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, each time period, which is two months, the price becomes P = P₀ + 20% of P₀. That simplifies to P = P₀ * (1 + 0.20) = P₀ * 1.20.

Wait, so each two-month period, the price is multiplied by 1.20. So, after each two months, it's 1.20 times the previous price. So, over multiple two-month periods, the price will compound.

Now, the total time is 36 months. How many two-month periods are there in 36 months? Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 2 is 18. So, there are 18 two-month periods in 36 months.

Therefore, the price after 36 months will be P = P₀ * (1.20)^18.

So, plugging in the numbers, P = 20 * (1.20)^18.

Now, I need compute (1.20)^18. Wait, no, 18. Let me compute that step by step.

First, let me compute (1.20)^2, which is 1.44.

Then, (1.44)^2 is 2.0736.

Wait, but 1.20 squared is 1.44, then 1.44 squared is 2.0736. Hmm, but that's only two two-month periods. Wait, no, 18 two-month periods is 18 steps.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms or exponent rules, but since it's 18 periods, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest, which is similar here: A = P(1 + r)^n, where P is principal, r is rate, and n is number of periods.

So, in this case, P is $20, r is 0.20, and n is 18.

So, A = 20 * (1.20)^18.

I need to compute (1.20)^18.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 1.20^1 = 1.20

1.20^2 = 1.44

1.20^3 = 1.44 * 1.20 = 1.728

1.20^4 = 1.728 * 1.20 = 2.0736

1.20^5 = 2.0736 * 1.20 = 2.50288

1.20^6 = 2.50288 * 1.20 = 3.003456

1.20^7 = 3.303456 * 1.20 = 3.9641472

1.20^8 = 3.9641472 * 1.20 = 4.75697664

Wait, so 1.20^8 is approximately 4.75697664.

So, A = 20 * 4.75697664 ≈ 20 * 4.75697664 = 95.1395328.

So, approximately $95.14.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again because 1.20^8 is 4.75697664
