Okay, so I have this problem here where Will buys 15 oranges. Then, when he gets home, he asks his two sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest. I need to figure out how many oranges are left unwashed. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Will has 15 oranges. He tells his two sons to wash as many oranges as their age. So, each son will wash a number of oranges equal to their age. The oldest son is 8, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so that would be 8 divided by 2, which is 4. So, the youngest son is 4 years old and will wash 4 oranges.

Wait, so if the oldest son is 8 and the youngest is 4, then together they can wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. But Will has 15 oranges in total. So, if they wash 12 oranges, but he only has 15, that means they can't wash all 12. So, how many oranges are left unwashed?

Let me think. If the total number of oranges is 15, and the sons can wash 12 oranges, but since they can't wash more oranges than he has, the number of oranges they can actually wash is limited by the total number of oranges. So, the maximum number of oranges they can wash is 15. Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed would be 15 - 12 = 3.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because the sons can only wash as many oranges as their age, but if the total number of oranges is less than the sum of their ages, then the number of oranges they can wash is equal to the total number of oranges. So, in this case, 15 is less than 12, so they can only wash 15 oranges. But that doesn't make sense because they can't wash more than they have. So, actually, the number of oranges they can wash is the minimum of the sum of their ages and the total number of oranges.

So, the sum of their ages is 12 (8 + 4) and the total number of oranges is 15. So, the number of oranges they can wash is 12, but since they can't wash more than 15, they can only wash 12 oranges. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: "When he gets home, he asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old." So, each son is to wash as many oranges as their age. So, the oldest son is 8, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest is 4, so he will wash 4 oranges. So, together, they can wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. But Will only has 15 oranges. So, the total number of oranges they can wash is 12, but since he only has 15, they can only wash 12. Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 -12 = 3.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the sons are washing oranges, and each son is to wash as many as their age, so the oldest son is 8, so he washes 8, youngest is 4, so he washes 4. So, total oranges washed is 8 +4=12. But he only has 15, so 15 -12=3 left. So, 3 oranges are left unwashed.

But wait, is there another way to interpret this? Maybe the total number of oranges they can wash is the sum of their ages, but if that sum is more than the number of oranges, then they can only wash as many as they have. So, in this case, 12 oranges, but he has 15, so they can only wash 12, so 15-12=3 left.

Alternatively, if the sum of their ages is 12, but he has 15, so 15 oranges are left unwashed. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. The problem says, "he asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old." So, each son is to wash as many oranges as their age. So, the oldest son is 8, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest is 4, so he will wash
