Q: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Andrew bakes some mini pastries, and I need to figure out the total calories of all the pastries he baked. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. So, that's 200 of one thing and 300 of another. Each of these mini pastries has a certain number of calories. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. But wait, the problem also mentions that a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. Hmm, so does that mean each mini pastry is 1/3rd the calories of a normal one? Or is it that each mini pastry is 1/3rd of the total calories? I need to clarify that.

Let me read the problem again: "A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?"

So, it seems like each mini pastry (whether it's a cinnamon roll or a blueberry muffin) has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. So, that means each mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of 660 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of 450 calories.

Wait, hold on, the problem says "a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories." So, that's the normal version. So, each mini version is 1/3rd of that. So, for the cinnamon rolls, each mini would be 660 divided by 3, and for the blueberry muffins, each mini would be 450 divided by 3.

So, let me compute that.

First, for the cinnamon rolls: 660 calories per normal, so 660 divided by 3 is 220 calories per mini cinnamon roll.

Similarly, for the blueberry muffins: 450 calories per normal, so 450 divided by 3 is 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.

Okay, so now I know the calorie count per mini for each type.

Now, Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. So, I need to calculate the total calories for each type and then add them together.

Let me compute the calories for the cinnamon rolls first. 200 mini rolls, each with 220 calories. So, 200 multiplied by 220.

Wait, 200 times 220. Let me compute that. 200 times 200 is 40,000, and 200 times 20 is 4,000, so 40,000 + 4,000 is 44,000. So, 200 times 220 is 44,000 calories from the cinnamon rolls.

Now, for the blueberry muffins: 300 mini muffins, each with 150 calories. So, 300 times 150. Hmm, 300 times 100 is 30,000, and 300 times 50 is 16,500. So, adding those together, 30,000 + 16,500 is 46,500 calories from the blueberry muffins.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. 300 times 150. Alternatively, 150 is 100 + 50, so 300 times 100 is 30,0000, and 300 times 50 is 16,500. So, 30,000 + 16,500 is 46,500. Yeah, that seems right.

So, now, to find the total calories, I need to add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins together.

So, 44,000 (from the cinn coss) plus 46,500 (from the blueberry muffins). Let me add those.

44,0000 + 46,500. Let's see, 44,000 + 46,
