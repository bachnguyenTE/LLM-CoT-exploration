Q: A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?

Okay, so I have this problem about a sloth eating berries. Let me try to understand it step by step. The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and come back up. He wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. I need to find the least number of berries he can pick up per trip. Hmm, okay.

First, let me break down the information. The total time for one trip is 4 hours. That includes going down, picking up berries, and coming back up. So, each round trip takes 4 hours. Now, he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Hmm, 8 hours is exactly two round trips because each round trip is 4 hours. So, if he does two round trips, that would take him 8 hours.

Wait, but if he does two round trips, he would pick up berries twice. So, if he picks up 'x' number of berries each time, then the total number of berries he would collect would be 2x. But he wants to collect 24 berries. So, 2x = 24, which would mean x = 12. So, does that mean he picks up 12 berries per trip? But the question is asking for the least number of berries he can pick up per trip. So, maybe 12 is the answer? But wait, let me think again.

Is there a way he can pick up fewer berries per trip and still collect 24 in 8 hours? Maybe if he doesn't do two round trips, but does some other combination. But wait, each round trip is 4 hours, so in 8 hours, he can only do two round trips. So, he can't do partial trips or anything. So, he has to do two round trips, each time picking up 'x' berries. So, 2x = 24, so x = 12. So, 12 is the number.

But wait, hold on. Maybe he can do more than two trips? But 8 hours divided by 4 hours per trip is 2. So, he can't do more than two trips. So, he can't do three trips because that would take 12 hours, which is less than 8. So, he can't do three trips. So, he can only do two round trips.

Therefore, he needs to pick up 12 berries each time. So, 12 times 12 is 24. So, 12 is the number. So, is 12 the answer? But wait, the question says "the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground." So, is 12 the least? Or is there a way to do it in less time?

Wait, maybe he can do some trips with fewer picks and then come back? But no, because each trip is a round trip. So, each time he goes down and up, he has to pick up the same number of berries. So, he can't pick up fewer and then come back because that would require more time.

Wait, but maybe he can do multiple trips in parallel? But no, the problem says he's moving down and up, so each trip is a single round trip. So, he can't do two trips at the same time. So, he can only do two round trips in 8 hours.

So, if he does two round trips, each time picking up 12 berries, he can collect 24 in 8 hours. So, 12 is the number. So, is 12 the answer? But wait, the question is asking for the least number of berries he can pick up per trip. So, is 12 the minimum? Or is there a way to do it in less time?

Wait, maybe he can do some trips with fewer picks and then come back, but that would require more time. So, for example, if he goes down, picks up 10 berries, comes back, that's 2 hours. Then, he can go down again, pick up 12, come back, that's another 2 hours. So, in total, 4 hours. Then, he can go down again, pick up 12, come back, another 2 hours. So, that's 6 hours. Then, he can go down again, pick up 12, come back, another 2 hours. So, that's 8 hours. So, in this case, he picks up 12 per trip, but he does it three times, each time with 10 picked up. So, total picked up is 12*3=36, but he only needs 24. So, that's more than needed. So, that's not efficient.
