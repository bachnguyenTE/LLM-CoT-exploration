Q: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, Zaid earns $6000 per month. His expenses and donations are spread out in different parts of his salary. Let me list out all his expenses and see how much each part is.

1. **Rent**: He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, 1/4 of $6000. Let me calculate that. 1/4 of 6000 is 6000 divided by 4, which is 1500. So, $1500 goes to rent.

2. **Car Fuel**: He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. So, 1/3 of 6000. Let me compute that. 6000 divided by 3 is 2200. So, $2200 goes to car fuel.

3. **Charity Donation**: After paying for rent and fuel, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much he has left after rent and fuel first.

Let me subtract the rent and fuel from his total salary. So, $6000 - $1500 (rent) - $2200 (fuel). Let me do that subtraction step by step.

First, 6000 - 1500 is 4500. Then, 4500 - 2200. Let me subtract 2000 from 4500, which is 2500, and then subtract the remaining 200. So, 2500 - 200 is 2300. So, after paying for rent and fuel, he has $2300 left.

Now, he donates half of that to charity. Half of 2300 is 1150. So, he donates $1150 to charity.

4. **Given to Daughter and Wife**: He gives his daughter $2000 for weekly expenses and $7000 for his wife for groceries and household goods. Wait, $7000? That seems like a lot. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, his total salary is $6000. He's already spent $1500 on rent and $2200 on fuel, which is $3700. Then he donates $1150, so total spent so far is 3700 + 1150 = 4850. So, he has 6000 - 4850 = 1150 left. But he gives $2000 to his daughter and $7000 to his wife. Wait, that can't be right because he only has $1150 left. So, he can't give $2000 and $7000. That must be a mistake.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says he gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household goods. So, maybe the amounts are in dollars, but perhaps he's giving them as a total? Or maybe it's a typo. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says: "He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods." So, 200 and 700. So, 200 + 700 is 970. So, he gives away $970 in total.

But wait, he only has $1150 left after rent, fuel, and charity. So, he can't give $970. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the remaining amount after rent and fuel.

Wait, let me recalculate that. His total salary is $6000. He spends 1/4 on rent, which is 1500, and 1/3 on fuel, which is 2200. So, 1500 + 2200 is 3700. So, 6000 - 3700 is 2300. Then, he donates half of that, which is 1150. So, 2300 - 1150 is 1150. So, he has $1150 left after all those expenses.

But then, he gives his daughter $200
