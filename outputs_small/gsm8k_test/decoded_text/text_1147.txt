Q: Lauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.  How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?

Okay, so Lauren has this job where she can draw different sizes of picture scenes. She can do 5 large ones, 6 medium, or 7 small each day. The project requires her to create 45 large, 36 medium, and 49 small picture scenes. I need to figure out how many days it will take her to finish all of them. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I should calculate how many days it would take her to complete each type of picture scene separately. Then, I can add up the days for each type to get the total days needed. That makes sense because she can work on each type independently, right?

Starting with the large-sized picture scenes. She needs 45 of them, and she can draw 5 each day. So, to find out how many days that would take, I can divide the total number by her daily rate. Let me write that down: 45 divided by 5. Hmm, 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, that would take her 9 days to finish all the large ones.

Next, the medium-sized picture scenes. She needs 36 of them, and she can draw 6 each day. So, 36 divided by 6. That's 1. So, that should take her just 1 day to finish all the medium ones.

Now, the small-sized picture scenes. She needs 49 of them, and she can draw 7 each day. So, 49 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 49 divided by 7 is 7. So, that would take her 7 days to finish all the small ones.

Now, if I add up all those days: 9 days for large, 1 day for medium, and 7 days for small. So, 9 plus 1 is 10, and 10 plus 7 is 17. So, in total, it would take her 17 days to finish all the picture scenes.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the large ones: 5 per day times 9 days is 45, which matches what she needs. For the medium: 6 per day times 1 day is 6, which is exactly what she needs. For the small: 7 per day times 7 days is 49, which is what she needs. So, all the numbers add up correctly.

Is there any other way she could do this? Maybe if she works on multiple types at the same time? But the problem doesn't specify that she can work on different types simultaneously. It just says she can draw each size per day. So, I think it's safe to assume she can only work on one type at a time. Therefore, the total days would be the sum of the days needed for each type.

So, 9 days for large, 1 day for medium, and 7 days for small. Adding those together: 9 + 1 +7. Let me add 9 and 1 first, which is 10, and then add 7, which gives 17. So, 17 days in total.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each calculation seems straightforward, and the numbers check out when I multiply them back. So, I feel confident that 17 days is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of days Lauren will take is \boxed{17}.

Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized, 36 medium-sized, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, we calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene:
- For large-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.
- For medium-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.
- For small-sized picture scenes: \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Adding these together gives the total number of days:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 17 \]

Thus, the total number of days Lauren will take is \(\boxed{17}\).
