Q: Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ronnie and Rissa. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, it says Ronnie was given $5. Then Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie. Hmm, so if Ronnie has $5, Rissa must have 3 times that, which is 3 * 5 = $15. Wait, no, that can't be right because 3 times 5 is 15, but that would mean both have $5 each. But then the problem says after each of them gave an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting something.

Let me read it again: "Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money." So, maybe I need to set up some variables.

Let me denote the amount each gave to their little sister as x. So, Ronnie gave x dollars to his sister, and Rissa also gave x dollars to hers. Then, after giving away x, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. So, let's figure out how much Rissa originally had.

Wait, Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. So, if Ronnie had $5, Rissa had 3*5 = $15. So, Rissa had $15 initially. Then, she gave away x dollars, so she is left with 15 - x. According to the problem, she is left with 4/5 of her money. So, 15 - x = (4/5)*15. Let me compute that.

(4/5)*15 is equal to 12. So, 15 - x = 12. Wait, that would mean x = 15 -12 = 3. So, x is 3. So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave away $3 each to their little sister.

Now, how much money does Ronnie have left? He started with $5 and gave away $3, so he has 5 - 3 = $2 left. So, the answer should be $2.

Wait, let me double-check. Ronnie had $5, Rissa had $15*3 = $15. They both gave $3 each to their sister. So, Rissa is left with 15 - 3 = $12, which is indeed 4/5 of her original $15. Because 4/5 of 15 is 12, but wait, 4/5 of 15 is 12, which is correct. So, Rissa is left with $12, which is 4/5 of her original $15. So, that seems consistent.

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is $2.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "after each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister." So, both gave the same amount, x, which is 3. So, Ronnie had 5, gave 3, so 2 left. Rissa had 15, gave 3, so 12 left, which is 4/5 of 15. So, that's correct.

So, the answer is $2.

But wait, the question is asking "How much is left in Ronnie's money?" So, the answer is $2.

But let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to make sure.

Alternatively, let's denote the amount each gave as x. So, after giving x, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount. So, Rissa's original amount is 15, as we saw. So, 15 - x = (4/5)*15. So, 15 - x = 12, so x = 3. So, same result.

So, Ronnie had 5, gave 3, so 2 left. So, the answer is 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios or something else, but I think the way I did it is straightforward.

So, I think the answer is $2.

**Final Answer**
The amount left in Ronnie's money is \boxed{2}.

Ronne was given $5. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, which is $15. After each of them gave an equal amount of money, x, to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. 

Rissa's original amount is $15. After giving away x, she is left with 4/5 of her money:
