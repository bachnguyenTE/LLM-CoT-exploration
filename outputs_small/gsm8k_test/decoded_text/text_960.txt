Q: A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?

Okay, so I have this problem about a pirate crew digging for treasure on an island marked X. They dig holes over several days, and I need to figure out how many holes they dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the information given:

- **Day 1:** They dug 10 holes.
- **Day 2:** They dug 13 holes.
- **Day 3:** They dug 8 holes, but then they stopped early and filled in 2 holes because the pirates kept falling in. So, actually, they only dug 8 - 2 = 6 holes on the third day.
- **Day 4:** They found a treasure chest with gold, jewels, and an aged hat. The key piece of information here is that the island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day.

I need to find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. So, that would be the number of holes they dug on day 4, excluding the ones they found later.

Let me try to structure this.

First, let's figure out the total number of holes they had by the end of the first day. Since they dug 10 holes on day 1, that's straightforward: 10 holes.

Then, on day 2, they dug 13 holes. So, adding that to the previous total: 10 + 13 = 23 holes by the end of day 2.

On day 3, they dug 8 holes, but then they had to fill in 2 holes because the pirates were falling in. So, the actual number of holes they dug on day 3 is 8 - 2 = 6 holes. So, adding that to the previous total: 23 + 6 = 29 holes by the end of day 3.

Now, on day 4, they found the treasure chest. The problem says that at that point, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of day 1. So, the number of holes on day 4 is four times the number of holes at the end of day 1.

Wait, hold on. Is the number of holes on day 4 four times the number of holes at the end of day 1? Or is it four times the number of holes at the end of day 3?

Let me read that again: "The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day." Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. It says "by then," which could mean by the end of day 4, or by the end of day 3? Hmm.

Wait, the treasure was found on day 4, so the number of holes on day 4 is four times the number of holes at the end of day 1. So, "by then" refers to day 4. So, the number of holes on day 4 is four times the number of holes at the end of day 1.

So, the number of holes on day 4 is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

But wait, on day 4, they dug some holes, and then found the treasure. So, the total number of holes on day 4 is the number of holes they dug on day 4 plus the number of holes they had before day 4.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

At the end of day 3, they had 29 holes (23 + 6). Then, on day 4, they dig some holes, and then find the treasure. So, the total number of holes on day 4 is the number of holes they had before day 4 plus the number they dug on day 4.

But the problem says that the number of holes on day 4 is four times the number of holes at the end of day 1. So, holes on day 4 = 4 * holes at end of day1 = 4 *10 =40.

Therefore, holes on day4 = holes before day4 + holes on day4.

But wait, holes on day4 is the holes before day4 plus the holes they dug on day4. So, if H_before_day4 is the number of holes they had before day4, then H_before_day4 + holes_dug_day4 = 40.

But we don't know H_before_day4. Wait, but H_before_day4 is the number of holes they had before day4, which is the same as the number of holes at the end of day3, which is 29.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of holes on day4 is four times the number of holes at the end of day1
