Q: Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Gina's class, and I need to figure out how many kids aren't allergic to anything. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says, "Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?" Hmm, okay. So, we have some kids with allergies to dairy, some to peanuts, and some to both. I need to find out how many kids don't have any allergies.

Alright, let's break this down. I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram or something. So, if I have two groups: one group is kids allergic to dairy, and another group is kids allergic to peanuts. Some kids are in both groups because they're allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Maybe that applies here. Let me recall. The formula is: the total number in either group is equal to the number in the first group plus the number in the second group minus the number in both groups. So, in symbols, that would be:

Total = A + B - Both

Where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number allergic to both.

So, plugging in the numbers from the problem: A is 9, B is 6, Both is 3. So, total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both would be 9 + 6 -3. Let me calculate that: 9 +6 is 15, minus 3 is 12. So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

But wait, the total number of kids in the class is 32. So, if 12 kids are allergic to something, then the number of kids not allergic to anything would be the total minus the allergic ones. So, 32 -12. Let me do that: 32 -12 is 20. So, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 9 kids are only dairy, 6 are only peanuts, and 3 are both. So, if I add only dairy (9) and only peanuts (6), that's 15. But then, the 3 kids who are allergic to both are included in both the 9 and the 6, so we subtracted them twice. So, we need to add them back once, which is why it's 9 +6 -3 =12. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the total number of kids allergic to either is 9 +6 -3=12? Wait, that can't be right because 9 +6 is 15, minus 3 is 12. Wait, no, 9 +6 is 15, minus 3 is 12. So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. So, 32 total minus 12 allergic is 20. So, 20 kids are not allergic to anything.

Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the numbers. Let me think again. So, 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. So, the number of kids allergic to only dairy is 9 -3=6, because 3 are also allergic to peanuts. Similarly, the number of kids allergic to only peanuts is 6 -3=3. So, total number of kids allergic to either is only dairy (6) + only peanuts (3) + both (3) =12. So, 12 kids are allergic to something, so 32 -12=20 are not allergic.

Wait, that seems consistent. So, 20 kids are not allergic to anything. So, the answer should be 20.

But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a Venn diagram. So, imagine two circles: one for dairy allergic kids and one for peanut allergic kids. The dairy circle has 9 kids, the peanut circle has 6. The overlapping part is 3 kids. So, the total number in the dairy circle is 9, which includes the 3 who are also in the peanut circle. Similarly, the peanut circle has 6, which includes the 3 who are also in the dairy circle.

So, the total number in either circle is 9 +6 -3=12, as before. So, 12 kids are in either circle, meaning 32 -12=20 are outside both circles, meaning
