Q: Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?

Okay, so Annabelle wants to buy a phone that costs $4000. She already has $80 saved up. Hmm, that's a start, but she still needs more. Let me figure out how much more she needs.

First, let me write down what I know. The total cost of the phone is $400. Annabelle has $80 saved. So, the amount she still needs is the total cost minus what she has saved. That would be 400 minus 80. Let me do that subtraction: 400 minus 80. Hmm, 400 minus 80 is 320. So, she still needs $320. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 400 minus 80: 400 minus 80 is 320. Yeah, that seems correct.

But wait, she also has jobs where she works. She has two jobs. The first job pays her $10 per hour for 20 hours. So, let me calculate how much she earned from the first job. 10 dollars per hour times 20 hours. That would be 10 * 20. Let me compute that: 10 times 20 is 220. So, she earned $220 from the first job.

Then, she has another job where she works 15 hours, and she gets $5 per hour. So, let me calculate that. 5 dollars per hour times 15 hours. That's 5 * 15. Hmm, 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 5 is 25, so 50 plus 25 is 75. So, she earned $75 from her second job.

Now, let me add up her earnings from both jobs. She earned $220 from the first job and $75 from the second job. So, 220 plus 75. Let me add those together. 220 plus 70 is 290, and then plus 5 is 295. So, she earned a total of $295 from both jobs.

Now, let me add that to her savings. She already had $80 saved. So, her total savings after working both jobs would be her original savings plus her earnings. That's 80 plus 295. Let me add those: 80 plus 200 is 280, and then plus 95 is 375. So, she has $375 saved up in total.

Wait, but the total cost is $400, right? So, she needs to know how much more she needs to save. So, subtract her total savings from the total cost. That would be 400 minus 375. Let me compute that: 400 minus 300 is 100, and then minus 75 more is 25. So, she still needs $25 more.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that correctly. So, she had $80 saved, earned $220 from the first job, and $75 from the second job. So, 80 plus 220 is 300, and 300 plus 75 is 375. Then, 400 minus 375 is 25. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me go back through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total cost is 400. She has 80 saved. So, 400 minus 80 is 320. Then, from the first job, 10 per hour for 20 hours: 10*20=220. Second job: 5 per hour for 15 hours: 5*15=25. Wait, hold on, 5*15 is 25, not 25. Wait, 5*15 is 75, right? Because 5*10 is 50, and 5*5 is 25, so 50+25=75. So, 220 plus 75 is 295. Then, 80 plus 295 is 375. 400 minus 375 is 25. So, yeah, she still needs $25.

Wait, but hold on, 5*15 is 75, not 25. So, 220 plus 75 is 295. 80 plus
