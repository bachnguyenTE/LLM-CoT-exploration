Q: A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jack and his three friends playing a game at a new arcade. I need to figure out how much money they spent on play. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Jack decides to play with his 3 friends. Each game costs a quarter (which is 25 cents) for 20 minutes. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him, so they can only play half as long. One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long. They play for a total of 4 hours. The question is, how much money was used?

Alright, so let's parse this information.

1. **Jack's Game:**
   - Cost per game: 1 quarter (25 cents)
   - Duration: 20 minutes

2. **Friends' Games:**
   - Two friends are significantly worse than Jack. So, their playing time is half of Jack's.
   - One friend is significantly better, so their playing time is 1.5 times Jack's.

3. **Total Playtime:**
   - They play for 4 hours.

4. **Question:**
   - How much money was used?

So, I need to calculate the total time each person spent playing and then figure out how much each person paid, then sum it all up.

First, let's convert everything into the same units to make it easier. The total playtime is given in hours, but the game duration is in minutes. So, I should convert 4 hours into minutes.

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

So, total playtime is 240 minutes.

Now, let's figure out how much each person played.

Jack plays the game for 20 minutes. So, Jack's time is 20 minutes.

Now, the two friends who are significantly worse can only play half as long as Jack. So, half of 20 minutes is 10 minutes each. So, each of these two friends plays for 10 minutes.

The third friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. So, 1.5 times 20 minutes is 30 minutes. So, this friend plays for 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total playtime.

Jack: 20 minutes

Friend 1: 10 minutes

Friend 2: 10 minutes

Friend 3: 30 minutes

Total playtime: 20 + 10 +10 +30 = 70 minutes.

Wait, hold on. The total playtime is supposed to be 240 minutes, but adding up the individual playtimes only gives 70 minutes. That doesn't make sense. There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

It says, "Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes. Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long. One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long. They play for 4 hours."

Wait, so each game is 20 minutes, but each person is playing a separate game? Or are they playing the same game with multiple people?

Wait, the problem says "Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes." So, each game is 20 minutes, and each person plays one game. So, Jack plays one game, and each of his three friends plays one game each.

So, each game is 20 minutes, but the duration each person plays is different.

So, Jack plays 20 minutes, and each of his friends plays 10, 10, and 30 minutes.

Wait, but that adds up to 70 minutes, but the total playtime is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, that doesn't add up. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the total playtime is 4 hours, but each person is playing a separate game? So, each person is playing a separate game, each taking 20 minutes, but each person's game is different in duration.

Wait, but the problem says "they play for 4 hours." So, maybe all of them are playing simultaneously? Or perhaps the total time they spent playing is 4 hours.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.
