Q: Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Nancy is cleaning her old woodshed, and she found some creepy creatures: spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs. The question is asking how many bugs she counted in total. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, it says she saw 90 spiders. Hmm, wait, 90? That seems like a lot, but okay, maybe it's a typo or maybe it's correct. So, 90 spiders. Let me write that down: Spiders = 90.

Next, it says she saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, millipedes are one-third the number of spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, millipedes would be 90 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 90 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 9 three times, and 3 goes into 0 zero times, so that's 30. So, Millipedes = 30.

Alright, now the stink bugs. It says the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, let me break that down. First, twice the number of millipedes. Millipedes are 30, so twice that would be 30 × 2. Let me compute that: 30 × 2 is 60. Then, subtract 12 from that. So, 60 minus 12. Wait, 60 minus 12 is 48. So, Stink bugs = 48.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Twice the number of millipedes is 30 × 2 = 60. Then, minus 12: 60 - 12. Wait, 60 minus 12 is 48? Hmm, 60 minus 10 is 50, minus another 2 is 48. Yeah, that's correct. So, stink bugs are 48.

So, now, to find the total number of bugs, we need to add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs. So, total bugs = Spiders + Millipedes + Stink bugs.

Plugging in the numbers: 90 + 30 + 48. Let me add them step by step. 90 + 30 is 120, and then 120 + 48 is 168. So, total bugs are 168.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 90 spiders, 1/3 of that is 30 millipedes, and twice the millipedes is 60, minus 12 is 48 stink bugs. Adding them up: 90 + 30 is 120, plus 48 is 168. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me go through each step again. First, spiders: 90. Millipedes: 1/3 of 90 is 30. Stink bugs: 2 times 30 is 60, minus 12 is 48. Total bugs: 90 + 30 + 48. 90 + 30 is 120, plus 48 is 168. Yep, that's consistent.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the total number of bugs Nancy saw is 168.

**Final Answer**
The total number of bugs Nancy counted is \boxed{168}.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is one-third of the number of spiders, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
\]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[
\text{Stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[
\text{Total bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is \boxed{168}.
