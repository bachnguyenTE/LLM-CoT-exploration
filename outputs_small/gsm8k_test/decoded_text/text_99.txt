Q: Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?

Okay, so Mary has this problem about her potted plants. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Mary is an avid gardener. She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. She feels generous and is going to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. The question is, how many potted plants will Mary remain with?

Alright, so let's break this down. Mary has 18 new potted plants. She already has some potted plants on her window ledges. Each of the 40 ledges has 2 potted plants. So, first, I need to figure out how many potted plants she already has in total.

To find that, I can multiply the number of ledges by the number of potted plants per ledge. So, 40 ledges times 2 potted plants per ledge. Let me write that out:

40 ledges * 2 potted plants/ledge = 80 potted plants.

So, Mary already has 80 potted plants. Then, she received 18 more. So, the total number of potted plants she has before giving any away is 80 + 18. Let me calculate that:

80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Okay, so she has 98 potted plants in total. Now, she is going to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges to her friends and family. So, she's giving away 40 potted plants in total. Each potted plant is from a different ledge, so she's giving one from each of the 40 ledges.

So, she's giving away 40 potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will have left is the total she has minus the ones she's giving away. So, 98 - 40. Let me compute that:

98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants remaining after giving away 40.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 40 ledges times 2 potted plants each is 80. Then, adding the 18 new ones gives 98. Then, subtracting 40 potted plants she's giving away, which is 98 -40, which is indeed 58.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the number of potted plants she has on each ledge after giving some away.

Originally, each ledge has 2 potted plants. She's giving away 1 from each, so each ledge will have 1 potted plant left. Since there are 40 ledges, each with 1 potted plant, that's 40 potted plants. Then, she has the 18 new potted plants. So, total potted plants left would be 40 +18, which is 58. That's the same answer as before.

So, that seems to confirm that the answer is 58.

Wait, but let me make sure that the 18 new potted plants are separate from the ones on the ledges. The problem says she received 18 new potted plants, and she already has 2 on each of the 40 ledges. So, the 18 new ones are separate from the 80 she already has. So, when she gives away 1 from each of the 40 ledges, she's giving away 40 potted plants, each from a different ledge, and she's also adding 18 new ones. So, the total potted plants she has is 80 +18=98, and she gives away 40, so 98-40=58.

Alternatively, if I think of it as the total potted plants she has is 80 +18=98, and she gives away 40, so 98-40=58.

Either way, the answer is 58.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 58.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{58}

Mary received 18 new potted plants and already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, we calculate the number of potted plants Mary already has:
