Okay, so Mark needs to get a new radiator for his car, and the cost is $400. But he can't afford to buy it from the store, so he goes to a junk shop where he finds it for 80% off. Then he hires a mechanic to install it, and it takes 3 hours at $50 per hour. I need to figure out how much Mark paid in total.

First, let me break this down. The original price is $400. The junk shop is offering it at 80% off. Hmm, so I need to calculate 80% of $400 and then subtract that from the original price to get the discounted price from the junk shop.

Wait, 80% off means he's paying 100% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 80% is 20%. So, 20% of $400. Let me calculate that. 20% is the same as 0.22 in decimal. So, 0.22 multiplied by 400.

Let me do that multiplication. 0.22 * 400. Hmm, 0.2 * 400 is 84, and 0.02 * 400 is 8.4, so adding those together, 84 + 8.4 is 92.4. So, the discounted price from the junk shop is $92.40.

Okay, so he pays $92.40 for the radiator. Then he hires a mechanic to install it, and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour. I need to calculate the cost of the mechanic's work. So, 3 hours multiplied by $50 per hour.

Let me compute that. 3 * 50 is 150. So, the mechanic's labor is $150.

Now, to find the total amount Mark paid, I need to add the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's labor together. So, $92.40 + $150.

Adding those together: 92.40 + 150.00 is 242.40.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 92.40 plus 150.00. So, 92.40 + 150 is 242.40. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Mark paid a total of $242.40 for the radiator and the mechanic's work.

But just to double-check, let me go through the steps again.

Original price: $400.

80% off means he pays 20% of 400. 20% is 0.20, so 0.20 * 400 is 80. So, 400 - 80 is 320. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did earlier.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

If the discount is 80%, that means he's paying 100% - 80% = 20% of the original price. So, 20% of 400 is 0.20 * 400, which is 80. So, the discounted price is $80.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought it was 22%. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, 80% off means the discount is 80%, so the amount he pays is 100% - 80% = 20% of the original price. So, 22% of 400 is 92.40, but 20% is 80.

Wait, no, 20% is 84, right? Wait, 10% of 400 is 40, so 20% is 80, and 2% is 8.40, so 22% is 80 + 8.40 = 88.40. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, let me clarify. 80% off means he pays 100% - 80% = 20% of the original price. So, 20% of 400 is 0.22 * 400.

Wait, 0.22 * 400. Let me compute that again. 0.2 * 400 is 80, and 0.02 * 400 is
