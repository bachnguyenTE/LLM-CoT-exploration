Q: Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.  If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Brian and Bobby with their video games. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can handle it.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. It says, "Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does." Hmm, okay. So Bobby's number of video games is related to Brian's. Then it says, "If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?" So, I need to find out how many video games Bobby has after Brian lost 5 games.

Alright, let's parse this. The key information is:

1. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times Brian's video games.
2. Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5 before the comparison.

So, first, I need to figure out how many video games Brian has after he lost 5. Then, use that number to find out how many Bobby has.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Find Brian's current number of video games after losing 5.
2. Use that number to calculate Bobby's video games.

Starting with step 1: Brian originally has 20 video games, but he lost 5. So, subtract 5 from 20.

20 - 5 = 15

So, Brian now has 15 video games.

Now, moving on to step 2: Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, first, I need to find 3 times Brian's current number of video games, and then subtract 5.

Let me write that out:

Bobby's video games = 3 * (Brian's video games) - 5

We already found that Brian's video games are 15, so plug that in:

Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5

Let me compute that. 3 times 15 is 45, right? 15 + 15 is 30, plus another 15 is 45. Then, subtract 5 from 45.

45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, Brian had 20, lost 5, so 15. 3 times 15 is 45, minus 5 is 40. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again.

Original number of Brian's games: 20.

He lost 5, so 20 - 5 = 15. That's correct.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times Brian's games. So, 3 times 15 is 45. 45 minus 5 is 40. That's correct.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Wait, hold on, let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Sometimes, these problems can be a bit ambiguous.

The problem says, "Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does." So, that translates to Bobby = 3 * Brian - 5. So, that's the formula I used.

But just to make sure, let's think about it in another way. If Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times Brian's games, that means Bobby's games = 3*(Brian's games) - 5. So, yeah, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, if I think of it as Bobby's games = (3 * Brian's games) - 5, which is the same as 3*(Brian's games - something). But no, that's not the case here. It's 5 fewer than 3 times, so it's 3*(Brian's games) minus 5.

So, yeah, I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when problems say "5 fewer than X," it can be confusing. Is it X - 5 or 5 - X? But in this case, since it's 5 fewer than 3 times, it's definitely 3X - 5.

So, 3*(15) -5? Wait, no, 3*(15) is 45, minus 5 is 40. So, yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it were 5 fewer than something else, but in this case, it's 3 times Brian's games minus 5.

So, I think I'm confident that Bobby has 40 video games.

Wait, hold on, let me just write
