Q: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about jellyfish in a tank, and I need to figure out how many jellyfish are in the tank. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Hmm, okay, so if I let the total number of jellyfish be, let's say, J, then the number of large jellyfish would be (1/5)J. That makes sense because a fifth of them are large.

Next, it mentions that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, if there are (1/5)J large jellyfish, then the number of them that change color is (1/3) of that. Let me write that down: (1/3)*(1/5)J. That simplifies to (1/15)J. So, (1/15)J jellyfish change color from green to blue.

The problem also says that when the UV light is on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, that means (1/15)J equals 6. So, I can set up the equation: (1/15)J = 6. To find J, I can multiply both sides by 5. So, J = 6*5, which is 30. So, does that mean there are 30 jellyfish in the tank? Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me go through it again. If there are J jellyfish in total, then 1/5 of them are large, so (1/5)J. Then, a third of those large ones change color, so (1/3)*(1/5)J = (1/15)J. And that equals 6. So, J = 6*5 = 30. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 30 jellyfish in total.

But let me think again. If there are 30 jellyfish in total, then 1/5 of them are large, which is 6 large jellyfish. Then, a third of those 6 change color, which is 2 jellyfish. But the problem says 6 jellyfish changed color. Wait, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. If 1/5 of the total are large, which is 6, and a third of those 6 change color, that's 2. But the problem says 6 changed color. So, that suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?"

So, the key here is that the other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. So, the only ones that change color are the large ones, and a third of them change color. So, if 6 changed color, that means 6 is a third of the large jellyfish. So, the number of large jellyfish is 6*3=18. So, 18 large jellyfish. Then, since 1/5 of the total are large, 18 is 1/5 of the total. So, total jellyfish is 18*5=90.

Wait, so that's different. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong because I thought that 1/5 of the total are large, but actually, the number of large jellyfish is 1/5 of the total, but the number that change color is 1/3 of that. So, if 6 changed color, that's 1/3 of the large jellyfish, so the number of large jellyfish is 18, and since 18 is 1/5 of the total, the total is 90.

So, that makes more sense. So, the answer is 90 jellyfish.

Wait, let me verify that. If there are 90 jellyfish in total, then 1/5 of them are large, which is 18. Then, a third of those 18 change color, which is 6. So, 6 changed color, which matches the problem statement. So, that seems correct.

So, my initial mistake was thinking that 1/5 of the total are large, but actually, the number of large jellyfish is 1/5 of the total, but the number that change color is 1/3 of that. So, 6 is 1/3 of the large jellyfish, so
