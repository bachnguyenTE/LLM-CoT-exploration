Q: Katina has $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $100 from the account every month, how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Katina has $3000 in her savings account, and she's going to remove $100 every month. I need to figure out how much money will be left after 2 years. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out how many months are in 2 years. I know that 1 year has 12 months, so 2 years would be 2 times 12, which is 24 months. So, Katina is going to remove money for 24 months.

Next, she removes $100 each month. To find out the total amount she'll remove over 24 months, I can multiply $100 by 24. Let me do that calculation: 100 times 24. Hmm, 100 times 20 is 2,200, and 100 times 2 is 200, so adding those together, 2,200 plus 200 is 2,400. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me try that again. 100 times 20 is 2,200, and 100 times 2 is 200, so adding 2,200 and 200 gives me 2,400. Yeah, that's correct. So, she'll remove a total of $2,400 over 2 years.

Now, Katina started with with $3,000. If she removes $2,400, then the remaining amount should be 3,000 minus 2,400. Let me subtract that: 3,000 minus 2,400. Hmm, 3,000 minus 2,400. So, 3,000 minus 2,000 is 1,000, and then minus another 400 is 600. So, 3,000 minus 2,400 is 600. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my subtraction again. 3,000 minus 2,400. If I take away 2,000, I get 1,000, and then subtract 400 more, which gives me 600. Yeah, that's correct. So, after 2 years, she'll have $600 left.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the total amount removed. 100 times 24 is 2,400. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3,000 minus 2,400 is indeed 600. So, the answer should be $600.

But just to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. If she removes $100 each month, after 12 months, she would have removed 12 times 100, which is $1,200. So, after 12 months, she has 3,000 minus 1,200, which is 1,800. Then, after another 12 months, another $1,200 is removed, so 1,800 minus 1,200 is 600. So, that's another way to see it. After 24 months, she has 600 left. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 2 years is 24 months, so 24 times 100 is 2,400. So, 3,000 minus 2,400 is 600. Yeah, that's the same result.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is $600.

**Final Answer**
The amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years will be \boxed{600} dollars.

Katina has $3000 in her savings account and removes $100 each month. To find out how much money will be left after 2 years, we first calculate the total number of months in 2 years, which is 24 months.

Next, we calculate the total amount removed over 24 months:
\[
100 \times 24 = 2400
\]

We then subtract this total amount from the initial amount in the account:
\[
3000 - 2400 = 600
\]

Thus, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years will be
