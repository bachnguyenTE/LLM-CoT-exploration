Q: A football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a football team with 105 members. It says there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Then it mentions there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. I need to find out how many players are on the defense. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The team has a total of 105 members. These members are divided into three categories: offense, defense, and special teams. The problem gives me relationships between the number of players in each category relative to the defense.

So, let's define some variables to represent the number of players in each position. Let me denote:

- Let D be the number of players on the defense.
- Then, the number of players on the offense is twice that, so 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so (1/2)D.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? The problem says "half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense." Hmm, actually, I think I might have misread that. Let me read it again: "There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense." So, that means the number of special teams players is half of the defense players. So, if D is defense, then special teams have (1/2)D players.

So, to recap:

- Defense: D
- Offense: 2D
- Special teams: (1/2)D

So, the total number of players is the sum of these three groups. So, D + 2D + (1/2)D = 105.

Let me write that equation out:

D + 2D + (1/2)D = 105

Now, let's combine like terms. First, D is the same as 1D, so 1D + 2D is 3D. Then, adding (1/2)D to that gives 3D + (1/2)D.

To add 3D and (1/2)D, I can think of 3D as 3.0D, so 3.0D + 0.5D = 3.5D, which is the same as 7/2 D.

So, 7/2 D = 105.

To solve for D, I can multiply both sides by 2/7.

So, D = 105 * (2/7)

Let me compute that. 105 divided by 7 is 15, and 15 multiplied by 2 is 30.

So, D = 30.

Wait, so the number of players on the defense is 30. Let me check if that makes sense.

If D is 30, then offense is 2D = 60, and special teams are (1/2)D = 15.

Adding them up: 30 + 60 + 15 = 105. That adds up correctly.

So, that seems to check out. So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in interpreting the problem, let me go through it again.

The problem says: "There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense." So, offense is 2D. That seems right.

"Half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense." So, special teams are half the defense. So, (1/2)D. That also seems correct.

Total players: 105. So, D + 2D + (1/2)D = 105. That's 3.5D = 105, so D = 30.5? Wait, no, 105 divided by 3.5 is 30. So, 30 is correct.

Wait, 3.5 times 30 is 105. Yes, that's correct.

So, I think my answer is correct. So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

**Final Answer**
The number of players on the defense is \boxed{30}.
</think>

Let \( D \) be the number of players on the defense. According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice that of the defense, which is \( 2D \). The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).
