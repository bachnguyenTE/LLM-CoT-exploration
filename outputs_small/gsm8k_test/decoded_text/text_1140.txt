Q: Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.  If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Gomer eating some mashed potatoes, and I need to figure out how many he ate. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says: "Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes." Hmm, okay. So, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. That means I need to subtract 5 from 23. Let me write that down:

23 scoops - 5 = 18 scoops.

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Got that part down.

Now, the next part says: "If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?" Hmm, this seems a bit more complex. Let me parse this sentence by sentence.

First, it's talking about the relationship between the number of potatoes and the number of scoops. It says, "If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes." So, let me break that down.

"3 less than 6 potatoes" – that should be 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes. So, it takes 3 potatoes to make something.

"1 less than 3 scoops" – that's 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. So, it takes 2 scoops of mashed potatoes to make something.

Wait, hold on. So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops? That seems a bit odd because usually, more potatoes would make more scoops, but here it's the opposite. Maybe I need to think about the rate at which potatoes are used per scoop.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the number of potatoes as P and the number of scoops as S. The problem says that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, 3 less than 6 is 3 potatoes, and 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops. So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.

So, the rate is 3 potatoes per 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed per scoop, I can divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops. So, 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop. That seems a bit high, but okay.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the number of scoops per potato. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then each potato makes 2/3 scoops. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, the problem is asking how many potatoes Gomer ate. So, maybe I don't need to go through the rate. Let me see.

Gomer ate 18 scoops, right? So, if each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes, then 18 scoops would require 18 * 1.5 potatoes. Let me calculate that.

18 * 1.5 = 12.0 * 1.5 = 12.0? Wait, no, 18 * 1.5 is 27. Because 10 *1.5 is 15, and 8 *1.5 is 12, so 15 +12=27. Wait, 1.5 *10 is 15, so 1.5*8 is 12, so 15+12=27? Wait, 1.5*8 is 12, so 1.5*10 is 15, so 1.5*18 is 27. Yeah, that's right.

So, 18 scoops would require 27 potatoes. Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops. So, 18 scoops would require 18 potatoes? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 1 potato makes 2/3 scoops, so to get 18 scoops, you need 18 / (2/3) potatoes. Let me compute that.

18 divided by (2/3) is 18 * (3/2) = 27. Yeah, that's correct. So, 27 potatoes.

So, putting it all together: Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes, so 18 *1.5=27 potatoes. Alternatively, using the rate, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops,
