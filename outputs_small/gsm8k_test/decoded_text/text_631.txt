Q: In a jewelers store, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. If a diamond Jewell is $2000, find the total price for all three jewels.

Okay, so I have this problem here about jewel prices, and I need to figure out the total price for all three jewels: gold, diamond, and silver. Let me try to break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the problem says that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as a diamond jewel. Hmm, okay. So if I know the price of a diamond, I can find the price of a gold one. It also mentions that a diamond jewel is $2000. So, let me write that down.

Price of diamond (D) = $2000.

Now, the price of a gold jewel (G) is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, mathematically, that would be:

G = (4/5) * D.

Since D is $2000, I can plug that in:

G = (4/5) * 2000.

Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, right? So, 0.8 multiplied by 2000. Hmm, 0.8 times 2000. Let me do that step by step.

First, 2000 times 0 is 2000, and 2000 times 0.8 is... wait, maybe I should break it down differently. 2000 divided by 5 is 440, and then multiplied by 4 is 1760. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Alternatively, 4/5 of 2000. So, 2000 divided by 5 is 440, and 440 multiplied by 4 is 1760. Yeah, that seems correct. So, G is $1760.

Okay, so gold is $1760. Now, moving on to the silver jewel. The problem says the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, if I have the price of gold, I can subtract $400 to get the price of silver.

Price of silver (S) = G - 400.

So, plugging in G as $1760:

S = 1760 - 400.

Let me do that subtraction. 1760 minus 400 is 1360. So, the silver jewel costs $1360.

Now, the question is asking for the total price for all three jewels: gold, diamond, and silver. So, I need to add up the prices of each of these.

Total price (T) = G + D + S.

Plugging in the numbers:

T = 1760 + 2000 + 1360.

Let me add them step by step. First, 1760 plus 2000. That should be 3760. Then, adding 1360 to that.

3760 + 1360. Let me add the thousands first: 3000 + 1000 is 4000. Then, the hundreds: 700 + 300 is 1000. Then, the tens: 60 + 60 is 120. And the ones: 0 + 0 is 0. So, adding those together: 4000 + 1000 is 5000, plus 120 is 5120. So, the total is $5120.

Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I add large numbers, I can slip up.

Starting with 1760 + 2000. Let me add 1760 + 2000. 1760 + 2000: 1000 + 2000 is 3000, 700 + 0 is 700, 60 + 0 is 60, and 0 + 0 is 0. So, 3000 + 700 is 3760, plus 60 is 3826, plus 0 is 3826. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 1760 + 2000 is 3760, and then adding 100 more is 3860. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I should do it column-wise.
