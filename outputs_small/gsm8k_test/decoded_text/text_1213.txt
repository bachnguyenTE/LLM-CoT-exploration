Q: Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will Stephen pay in the twelfth month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister. He promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. Hmm, so that means he's charging 2% interest on the amount he owes. Let me calculate that interest first.

So, 2% of $300 is... let me see, 0.02 multiplied by 300. That would be 0.02 * 300. Let me do the math: 0.02 * 300. Well, 0.02 is 2%, so 2% of 300 is 6. So, Stephen needs to pay back $300 plus $6, which is $306 in total.

Wait, hold on, is that right? So, he borrowed $300, and he's adding 2% interest, so the total amount he needs to return is $300 + 2% of $300. Yeah, that's $306. So, he has to pay back $306 in total.

But then, the problem says that for 11 months, Stephen will give his sister $25 per month. So, he's going to pay $25 each month for 11 months. Let me calculate how much that is. 11 months times $25 per month. So, 11 * 25 is... 275. So, he's going to pay $275 in the first 11 months.

Now, the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. So, after 11 months, he's paid $275, and he still owes some amount, which includes the interest. So, I need to figure out how much he owes after 11 months and then add the interest for the twelfth month.

Wait, no, actually, the interest is on the amount he owed, which is $306. So, he's going to pay $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $275. So, the total amount he's going to pay in the first 11 months is $275. So, the remaining amount he owes after 11 months is $306 minus $275. Let me calculate that: 306 - 275 is... 31. So, he still owes $31 after 11 months.

But wait, the problem says that the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. So, does that mean that the $31 is the principal, and the interest is calculated on that? Or is the $31 the total amount including interest?

Wait, let me read the problem again: Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. So, the total amount he needs to return is $300 plus 2% of $300, which is $306. So, he's going to pay back $306 in total.

Then, for 11 months, he gives his sister $25 per month. So, 11 months * $25 = $275. So, after 11 months, he's paid $275, so the remaining amount is $306 - $275 = $31. So, he still owes $31. But the problem says that the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. So, does that mean that the $31 is the amount he needs to pay on the twelfth month, or is there more interest involved?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Stephen borrowed $300, and he's supposed to return it with 2% interest. So, the total amount he needs to return is $306. But he's going to pay $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $275. So, after 11 months, he's paid $275, so the remaining amount is $31. But the problem says that the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. So, does that mean that the $31 is the amount he needs to pay on the twelfth month, or is there an interest on that $31?

Wait, maybe the $31 is the principal, and the interest is calculated on that. So, the interest on $31 for one month. But the problem doesn't specify the interest
