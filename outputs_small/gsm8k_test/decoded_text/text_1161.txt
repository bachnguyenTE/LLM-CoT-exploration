Q: Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Abraham who owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50 and then another quarter for $30. Then he sold the remaining part for $3 per square meter. I need to figure out how much money he'll make in total after selling all his land. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. Wait, hold on, $50? That seems a bit high for 40 square meters. Let me check the numbers again. He sold half of 80 square meters, which is 40 square meters, for $50. So, that means each square meter was sold for $50 divided by 40 square meters. Let me calculate that: $50 divided by 40 is $1.25 per square meter. Hmm, that's a lot of money per square meter. Maybe that's correct? Or maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says he sold half for $50. So, 50 dollars. So, 50 dollars for 40 square meters. So, 50 divided by 40 is 1.25. So, each square meter was sold for $1.25. That seems high, but okay, maybe it's correct. Let me note that down.

So, first sale: 40 square meters sold for $50. So, 40 sqm * $1.25/sqm = $50. That makes sense.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Wait, 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. So, 20 square meters sold for $30. So, $30 divided by 20 is $1.50 per square meter. Hmm, that's a bit more expensive than the first sale. So, each square meter was sold for $1.50 in the second sale.

Then, he sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, let's figure out how much land he sold in the third sale. He sold half (40 sqm) and a quarter (20 sqm), so total sold is 60 square meters. Therefore, the remaining land is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters. So, he sold the last 20 square meters for $3 per square meter.

So, let me calculate the total money he made from each sale.

First sale: 40 sqm * $1.25/sqm = $50.

Second sale: 20 sqm * $1.50/sqm = $30.

Third sale: 20 sqm * $3/sqm = $60.

So, adding them up: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations.

First, 40 square meters sold for $50. So, 50 divided by 40 is indeed 1.25 per sqm.

Then, 20 square meters sold for $30. 30 divided by 20 is 1.50 per sqm.

Then, 20 square meters sold for 20*3=60.

So, 50 + 30 is 85, plus 60 is 145. Wait, hold on, that's different from my previous total. Wait, no, 50 + 30 is 85, plus 60 is 145. So, $145 total.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was $140. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me recalculate.

First sale: 40 sqm * $1.25 = 40 * 1.25. 40 * 1 is 40, 40 * 0.25 is 10, so total is 50. Correct.

Second sale: 20 sqm * $1.50. 20 *1.50 is 30, and 2 *1.50 is 3. So, 33. So, 33.

Third sale: 20 sqm *3=60.

So, 50 +33=83, plus 60=143. Wait, that's 143. Hmm, so now I'm confused because my initial addition was 50 +3
