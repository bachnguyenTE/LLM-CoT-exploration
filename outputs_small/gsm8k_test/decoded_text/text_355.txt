Q: There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Eddy's backyard with three trees. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. Then, the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest one. So, if the shortest is 6, adding 5 feet would make the second tree 11 feet tall. Wait, 6 plus 5 is 11? Yeah, that seems right. So, the second tree is 11 feet tall.

Now, the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree first. The shortest is 6 feet, and the second is 11 feet. So, 6 plus 11 is 17 feet. That means the tallest tree is twice that, so 17 times 2 is 34 feet. So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

Wait, let me double-check that. The shortest is 6, second is 11, combined is 17, tallest is 34. Yeah, that seems to add up. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The tallest tree is \boxed{34} feet tall.

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is \(6 + 5 = 11\) feet. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees. The combined height of the shortest and second trees is \(6 + 11 = 17\) feet. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is \(2 \times 17 = 34\) feet.

\[
\boxed{34}
