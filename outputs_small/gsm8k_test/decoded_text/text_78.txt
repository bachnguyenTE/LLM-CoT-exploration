Q: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Vincent can buy flowers in two different packages. One is a package of 3 flowers for $2.50, and the other is a package of 2 flowers for $1. He wants to buy 18 flowers, and we need to figure out how much money he saves by buying at the better price. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out which package is cheaper per flower. That way, I can determine which one is the better deal. So, let's calculate the cost per flower for each package.

Starting with the package of 3 flowers for $2.50. To find the cost per flower, I can divide the total cost by the number of flowers. So, that would be $2.50 divided by 3. Let me do that calculation: 2.50 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 2.50 how many times? Well, 3 times 0 is 9, which is less than 10, so maybe 0.833... dollars per flower. Let me check: 3 times 0.833 is approximately 2.50. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, for the package of 2 flowers for $1. To find the cost per flower here, I'll divide $1 by 2. So, 1 ÷ 2 is 0.50 dollars per flower. That's 50 cents per flower. Comparing the two, the package of 2 flowers is cheaper at 50 cents per flower compared to the package of 3 flowers at approximately 83.33 cents per flower. So, the better deal is the package of 2 flowers.

Now, since Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, he should buy as many of the better deal packages as possible. So, let's figure out how many packages of 2 flowers he needs to buy to get 18 flowers. Since each package has 2 flowers, we can divide 18 by 2. Wait, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, he needs to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each. Each of these packages costs $1, so 9 times $1 is $9. So, the total cost for buying 18 flowers at the better price is $9.

Alternatively, just to make sure, let me check if buying 9 packages of 2 flowers is indeed 18 flowers. 9 times 2 is 18, yes, that's correct. So, the total cost is $9.

Now, let's figure out how much it would cost if he bought all the flowers at the more expensive package. If he buys all 18 flowers in the package of 3 flowers, how many packages would he need? 18 divided by 3 is approximately 2.666... So, he can't buy a fraction of a package, so he needs to buy 3 packages of 3 flowers each. Each package is $2.50, so 3 times $2.50 is $7.50. So, if he buys all 18 flowers in the more expensive package, it would cost $7.50.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing. Let me clarify. If he buys 3 packages of 3 flowers, that's 9 flowers, but he needs 18. So, actually, he needs to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers because 6 times 3 is 18. Each package is $2.50, so 6 times $2.50 is $15. So, if he buys all 18 flowers in the more expensive package, he actually needs to buy 6 packages, which would cost $15.

Wait, but earlier, I thought he only needed 9 packages of 2 flowers, which is cheaper. So, the total cost at the better price is $9, and at the more expensive price, it's $15. So, the difference between these two totals is the amount he saves by buying at the better price.

So, subtracting the two totals: $15 minus $9. Wait, that can't be right because $15 is more than $9. Wait, no, actually, he is saving money by buying at the better price, so the amount saved is the difference between the more expensive total and the cheaper total. So, $15 minus $9 is $6. So, he saves $6 by buying at the better price.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, if he buys 18 flowers at the better price, it's $9. If he buys them all at the more expensive price, it's $15.
