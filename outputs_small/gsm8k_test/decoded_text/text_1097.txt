Okay, so I have this problem here about Mary and John getting married, and there were some cars and buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. I need to figure out how many people were inside the church. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Mary and John got married last weekend, and there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. How many people were inside the church?

Alright, so the key pieces of information here are:

- Number of private cars: 20
- Number of buses: 12
- After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people
- Each car carried 3 people

And the question is asking for the number of people inside the church. So, I think I need to calculate the total number of people who were outside the church during the ceremony and then subtract that from the total number of people who were there to find out how many were inside.

Wait, hold on. The problem doesn't specify the total number of people who were at the church before the ceremony. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume that the total number of people at the church before the ceremony is the sum of the people inside and outside. But since only the outside is given, maybe I need to find the total number of people outside and then figure out how many were inside.

Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the number of people inside the church, so perhaps I need to find the total number of people at the church and then subtract the number of people who were outside. But since the problem doesn't give me the total number of people at the church, maybe I need to find the number of people inside based on the information given about the cars and buses.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem says there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. So, the number of people inside the church would be the total number of people who were there before minus the number of people who were outside.

But since the problem doesn't give me the total number of people at the church, maybe I need to find the number of people inside based on the number of cars and buses. Wait, but cars and buses are outside, so the number of people inside would be the total number of people at the church minus the number of people who were transported by the cars and buses.

But without knowing the total number of people at the church, I can't directly compute the number inside. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me read the problem again.

"Mary and John got married last weekend. There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people. How many people were inside the church?"

Wait, maybe the total number of people at the church is the sum of the people inside and the people outside. But since the problem doesn't specify the total number of people at the church, perhaps I need to find the number of people inside based on the number of cars and buses.

Wait, but cars and buses are outside, so the number of people inside would be the total number of people at the church minus the number of people transported by the cars and buses. But since the problem doesn't give me the total number of people at the church, maybe I need to find the number of people inside based on the number of cars and buses.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the number of people transported by the cars and buses, and then assume that the number of people inside the church is the total number of people at the church minus that number. But without knowing the total number, I can't compute it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the number of people inside the church by considering the number of people transported by the cars and buses, but since the total number isn't given, perhaps the answer is just the number of people inside the church, which is the total number minus the number transported.

Wait, but that still doesn't give me a numerical answer. Maybe I need to assume that the number of people inside the church is the total number of people at the church, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I need to find the number of people inside based on the number of cars and buses.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the number of people inside the church by adding the number of people transported by the cars and buses, but
