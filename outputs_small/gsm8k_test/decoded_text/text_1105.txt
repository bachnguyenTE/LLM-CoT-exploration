Okay, so Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and she wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years. She currently makes $100,000 per year, and she wants to live with 40% of her current salary. Hmm, let me try to figure out how many more years she needs to work.

First, I need to understand what she's planning to do. She's saving 20% of her income each year, which is $20,000 per year. She wants to save enough over 20 years to cover her expenses during retirement. But wait, her current salary is $100,000, and she wants to live with 40% of that. So, her annual living expenses are 40% of $100,000, which is... let me calculate that.

40% of $100,000 is 0.4 * 100,000 = $40,000 per year. So, she needs to save enough to cover $40,000 per year for her retirement because she wants to live with 40% of her current salary. Wait, no, actually, she's saving 20% of her salary each year, which is $20,000, but she wants to live with 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000. So, she needs to have a higher income to cover her expenses.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. She's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000, but she wants to live with 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000. So, her current salary is $100,000, and she wants to live with 40% of that, which is $40,000. So, she needs to have a higher income to live with $40,000. So, she needs to save more.

Wait, maybe I need to figure out how much she needs to save each year to have $40,000 per year. But she's already saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000. So, she needs to save an additional $20,000 per year to reach $40,000. So, she needs to save $20,000 more each year.

But she's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000. So, she needs to save an additional 100% of her salary to reach her goal. So, she needs to save 100% of $100,000, which is $100,000 per year. But she's only saving 20%, so she needs to save 800% more.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how much more she needs to save each year. She needs to save $20,000 more per year. Since she's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000, she needs to save 100% more of her salary. So, she needs to work 5 more years because 20% of $100,000 is $20,000, and she needs to save 100% of that, which would take 5 years.

Wait, let me check that again. If she needs to save an additional $20,000 per year, and she's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000, then she needs to save 100% more. So, 100% of $20,000 is $22,000. But she's only saving $20,000 per year, so she needs to save for 11 years. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the total amount she needs to save. She needs to have $40,000 per year for 20 years, so total savings needed is $88,000. She currently has $20,000 saved, so she needs to save an additional $68,000. She's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000, so she needs to save 340% more. So, 340% of $100,000 is $340,000. But she needs to
