Q: An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?

Okay, so I have this problem about an airport with two planes that fly multiple times a day. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are two planes. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. I need to find out how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day.

Hmm, let me parse this information. Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in a day as F. Then, the second plane flies 44 times, which is half of F. So, if I let F be the total flights of the first plane, then 44 = (1/2)F. That means F = 88. So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The second plane's flights are 44, which is half of the first plane's flights. So, yes, 44 = (1/2)F, so F = 88. That seems straightforward.

Now, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, flights to Greece are (3/4)F. Then, the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining flights are (1 - 3/4)F = (1/4)F. Since these are split equally between France and Germany, each of those would be (1/4)F divided by 2, which is (1/8)F.

So, flights to France would be (1/8)F. Since F is 88, then flights to France would be (1/8)*88. Let me calculate that. 88 divided by 8 is 11. So, flights to France are 11.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

Total flights of the first plane: F = 88.

Flights to Greece: (3/4)*88 = 66.

Remaining flights: 88 - 66 = 22.

These remaining 22 are split equally between France and Germany, so each gets 11.

So, flights to France: 11.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 11.

But let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem. It says the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

So, 44 is half of F, so F is 88. Then, 3/4 of 88 is 66, so 66 flights to Greece, and the remaining 22 are split equally, so 11 each to France and Germany. So, 11 flights to France.

Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything. So, the answer is 11.

**Final Answer**
The first plane takes \boxed{11} flights to France in one day.

Let \( F \) be the total number of flights made by the first plane in a day. The second plane flies 44 times, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. Therefore, we have:

\[
44 = \frac{1}{2}F
\]

Solving for \( F \):

\[
F = 88
\]

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
\]

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights are:

\[
88 - 66 = 22
\]

Each of these remaining flights is split equally between France and Germany, so each gets:

\[
\frac{22}{2} = 11
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
