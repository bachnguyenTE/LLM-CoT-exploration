Q: Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.

First, I need to determine the total number of employees in the company. Carolyn hired 40 employees in May.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of employees who had their contracts expired in June. One-fourth of 40 employees is 10 employees.

Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, which amounts to $240 per week.

To find the total payment for the employees who had their contracts expired, I'll multiply the number of expired employees by their weekly salary: 10 employees × $240 = $2400.

Finally, I'll add the total payment from May to the total payment from June to get the overall total amount paid to the employees in the two months: $6000 + $2400 = $8400.

To determine the total amount of money Carolyn's delivery service company paid to its employees in May and June, let's break down the calculations step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Employees**
- **May:** Carolyn hired **40 employees**.
- **June:** 
  - **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired**.
  - Number of expired employees = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) employees.

### **Step 2: Calculate the Weekly Pay for Each Employee**
- Each employee is paid **$15 per hour** for a **40-hour workweek**.
- **Weekly Pay per Employee** = \( 15 \times 40 = \$600 \).

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Payment for the Expired Employees**
- **Total Payment for 10 Employees** = \( 10 \times \$600 = \$6,000 \).

### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Payment for All Employees in May**
- **Total Employees in May** = 40.
- **Total Payment for 40 Employees** = \( 40 \times \$600 = \$26,400 \).

### **Step 5: Calculate the Total Payment for Both Months**
- **Total Payment for May and June** = \( \$26,400 + \$6,000 = \$32,400 \).

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{32400}
