Q: Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.  With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Josh is starting to juggle three balls, right? And each week, he adds one more ball. So, week one, he has 3 balls. Then week two, he adds one, so that's 4 balls. Week three, he adds another, making it 5 balls. And then week four, he adds one more, so that's 6 balls. 

But wait, the talent show starts at the end of the fourth week, so after week four, he slips and drops three balls. Hmm, so he had 6 balls by the end of week four. Then he drops three. But then, 2 of them are caught by people as they roll off the stage, and one gets lost because the auditorium is dark. 

So, let me break this down step by step. 

First, he starts with 3 balls. Then each week he adds one. So week 1: 3, week 2: 4, week 3: 5, week 4: 6. So by the end of week four, he has 6 balls. 

Then, he slips and drops three. So 6 minus 3 is 3. But then, 2 are caught by people as they roll off the stage. So that's 3 minus 2 equals 1. Then, one gets lost because the auditorium is dark. So 1 minus 1 equals 0. 

Wait, so does that mean he has 0 balls left? That seems a bit strange, but maybe that's the case. 

Let me double-check. He starts with 3, adds 1 each week for four weeks, so 3 + 4 = 7? Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Because if he starts with 3, and adds 1 each week for four weeks, that would be 3 + 4 = 7. But that contradicts my earlier thought. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. It says he starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week. So, does that mean he adds one ball each week, so week 1: 3, week 2:4, week3:5, week4:6. So by the end of week four, he has 6 balls. 

But then, the talent show begins at the end of the fourth week, so he slips and drops three. So 6 minus 3 is 3. Then, 2 are caught by people, so 3 minus 2 is 1. Then, one gets lost, so 1 minus 1 is 0. 

So, he ends up with 0 balls. That seems correct, but is that realistic? I mean, in real life, if you have 6 balls and lose 3, you have 3 left. Then, 2 are caught, so 1 left. Then, one gets lost, so 0. 

But maybe the problem is just asking for the number of balls he has after the slips, regardless of the loss. So, he starts with 6, drops 3, so he has 3 left. Then, 2 are caught, so 1, and then one gets lost, so 0. 

But the question is, "how many balls does he have with a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?" So, it's after the slips and the loss. So, 0. 

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see. 

He starts with 3, adds 1 each week for four weeks, so 3 + 4 = 7. Then, slips and drops 3, so 7 - 3 = 4. Then, 2 are caught, so 4 - 2 = 2. Then, one gets lost, so 2 - 1 = 1. 

Wait, now I'm confused. Which is it? 

Is the loss of one ball after the slips, or after the 2 are caught? The problem says: "2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark." So, it's 2 caught, then 1 lost. So, total loss is 3. So, 6 - 3 = 3, then 3 - 2 = 1, then 1 -1=0. 

Alternatively, if it's 2 caught, then 1 lost, so total loss is 3, so 6 -3=3, then 3 -2=1, then 1 -1=0. 

Either way, it's 0. 

But maybe the problem is just asking for the number after the slips, regardless of the loss. So, 6 -
