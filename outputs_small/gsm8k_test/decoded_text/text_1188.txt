Q: Digimon had its 20th anniversary.  When it came out John was twice as old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old is Jim?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Digimon's 20th anniversary. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Now, John is 28, and I need to find out how old Jim is. 

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that age difference remains constant over time. So, if John is twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release, the age difference between them is fixed. That means if I can find that difference, I can use it to find Jim's current age.

Let me denote Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release as J. Then, John's age at that time would be 2J because John was twice as old as Jim. So, the age difference between John and Jim is 2J - J, which is J. That means Jim was J years younger than John.

Now, the problem says that John is 28 now. So, if John was J years old when Digimon came out, and now he's 28, that means the time that has passed since Digimon's release is 28 - J years. 

But wait, since the age difference is J, and that difference remains the same, Jim's current age would be Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release plus the time that has passed. So, Jim's current age is J + (28 - J). Let me write that down:

Jim's current age = J + (28 - J) = 28.

Wait, that can't be right. If I add J and (28 - J), the J cancels out, and I just get 28. So, Jim is 28 now? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me try again. Let's denote J as Jim's age when Digimon came out. Then, John's age at that time was 2J. The age difference is 2J - J = J. 

Now, the time that has passed since Digimon's release is 28 - J years. So, Jim's current age is J + (28 - J) = 28. So, yes, that seems correct. So, Jim is 28 now.

But that seems a bit too easy. Let me think again. If John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, and now John is 28, then the age difference is 28 - J. But since John was twice as old as Jim, the age difference is J. So, 28 - J = J. Solving for J, we get 28 = 2J, so J = 14. Therefore, Jim was 14 when Digimon came out, and now he's 28. So, that makes sense.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake in my initial setup. I thought Jim's current age was J + (28 - J) = 28, but that's correct, but then I thought that the age difference is J, which is correct because 2J - J = J. So, the age difference is J, which is equal to 28 - J. So, 28 - J = J, so 28 = 2J, so J = 14. So, Jim was 14 when Digimon came out, and now he's 28. So, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 28. But wait, the problem says "how old is Jim?" So, if Jim is 28 now, that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.

The problem says, "When it came out John was twice as old as Jim." So, that means at the time of Digimon's release, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if I let J be Jim's age then, John was 2J. Now, John is 28, so the time that has passed is 28 - J. So, Jim's current age is J + (28 - J) = 28. So, that's correct.

But wait, if Jim was 14 when Digimon came out, and now he's 28, that's a 14-year age difference. So, John was 28 when Digimon came out, and Jim was 14, so the age difference is 14. So, that's consistent.

So, the answer is 28. Wait, but that seems like the same as John's current age. But that can't be, because if the age difference is 14, then Jim
