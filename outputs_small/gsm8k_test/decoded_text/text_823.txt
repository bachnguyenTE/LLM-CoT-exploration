Q: Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?

Okay, so I have this problem about Sasha and Julie playing basketball. They're best friends, which is cool, but I guess it's also a bit competitive. Let me try to figure out how to solve this step by step.

First, the problem says that there are two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha has the home court advantage, which means she scores more points. Specifically, Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Then, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, I can probably figure out how many points Julie scored in the first game.

Let me write that down. In the first game:
- Sasha's points = 14
- Julie's points = Sasha's points - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10

Wait, 14 minus 4 is 10? Hmm, that seems a bit low, but okay, maybe it's correct. So, Julie scored 10 points in the first game.

Now, the second game is at Julie's home court, which is Sasha's away game. So, Sasha's performance is going to be different here. The problem says that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. So, I need to figure out Julie's score in the first game, which we already know is 10, and then subtract 6 from that.

So, in the second game:
- Sasha's points = Julie's first game points - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4

Wait, that seems a bit low too. 4 points? That's like a basket a bit, but okay, maybe it's correct. So, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

Now, the question is asking for the total points Sasha scored during both games. So, I need to add up the points she scored in the first game and the second game.

First game: 14 points
Second game: 4 points
Total points = 14 + 4 = 18

Wait, that seems surprisingly low. 14 plus 4 is 8? Let me double-check my calculations.

First game: Sasha scored 14, Julie scored 10. That's correct because 14 - 4 is 10.

Second game: Sasha scored 6 fewer than Julie's first game. So, Julie's first game was 10, so 10 - 6 is 4. That's correct.

So, adding them together: 14 + 4 is indeed 18. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but maybe that's just how it is.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the games. The first game was Sasha's home, so she scored 14, Julie scored 10. The second game was Julie's home, so Sasha scored 6 fewer than Julie's first game. So, 10 - 6 is 4. So, yes, Sasha scored 4 in the second game.

So, 14 + 4 is 18. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. I guess it's just a small number, but I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game."

So, first game: Sasha 14, Julie 10.

Second game: Sasha scored 6 fewer than Julie's first game. So, 10 - 6 = 4.

Total points: 14 + 4 = 18.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 18.

Wait, but the problem is presented in a way that seems like it might have a trick or something. Maybe I should check if I interpreted the second game correctly.

It says, "Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game." So, that would be 10 - 6 = 4. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the order of operations or something. Let me see.

Wait, is it possible that "Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game" is interpreted as 6 fewer than Julie's score in the second game? But no, the wording is "Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game." So, it's 6 fewer than Julie's first game score.

So, that would be 10 - 6 = 4.

So, yeah, I think that's correct.
