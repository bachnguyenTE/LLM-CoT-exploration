Q: Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?

Okay, so Erika is saving up for a new laptop that costs $600. Hmm, wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check: $600? Yeah, that's six hundred dollars. So, she needs $600 in total. 

The sales assistant said that if she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. So, that means instead of paying the full price, she can pay $200 less. So, if the new laptop is $600, and she gets a $200 discount, then the price she has to pay is $600 minus $200, which is $400. So, she can buy the laptop for $400 after the discount.

Now, Erika is thinking this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse. She's been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom is also giving her $80 to help. So, let's add up all the money she's going to contribute.

First, her savings in her purse. Let's call that amount "S." Then, she gets $155 from her part-time job, and her mom gives her $80. So, the total amount she's going to add to her purse is S + $155 + $80. 

But wait, the problem says she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. So, that means her current savings plus the money she's getting from her part-time job and her mom's help should equal the amount she needs to buy the laptop. 

So, let me write that down as an equation. 

Current savings (S) + $155 (from job) + $80 (from mom) = Amount needed to buy laptop ($50 extra)

So, S + 155 + 80 = 50

Wait, that doesn't seem right. If she needs an extra $50, that means her total savings plus the $155 and $80 should equal $600. Because the laptop is $600, and she needs an extra $50, so her savings plus the $155 and $80 should be $600 - $50 = $550.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The laptop costs $600. She can buy it for $400 after the discount. So, she needs $400. But she's going to get some money from her part-time job and her mom. So, her savings plus the $155 and $80 should equal $400.

So, S + 155 + 80 = 400

So, S + 235 = 400

Therefore, S = 400 - 235 = 165

So, she has $165 in her purse.

Wait, let me verify that. If she has $165, plus $155 from her job, that's $165 + $155 = $320. Then, her mom gives her $80, so $320. Then, the total she has is $320, and the laptop is $400, so she needs an extra $96. But the problem says she only needs an extra $50. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me try again.

The laptop is $600. She can buy it for $600 - $200 discount, which is $400. So, she needs $400. She has some savings, plus $155 and $80, which is $235, so her savings plus $235 should equal $400. So, S + 235 = 400, so S = 400 - 235 = 165. So, she has $165.

But when I add $165 + $155 + $80, that's $165 + $235 = $400, which is the amount she needs. So, that seems correct.

But the problem says she only needs an extra $50. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check.

"Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop." So, that means her current savings plus the $155 and $80 equals $600 - $50 = $550.

So, S + 155
