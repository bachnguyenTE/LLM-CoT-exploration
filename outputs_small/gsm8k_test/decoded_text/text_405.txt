Q: Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Tyson would spend on making muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for each sandwich, he needs 1 pound of each ingredient. That means for each sandwich, he uses 2 pounds in total—1 for meat and 1 for cheese.

Now, each sandwich serves 4 people. So, if he makes one sandwich, it can feed 4 people. The total number of people watching the game is 20. So, he needs enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

Let me calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make. If each sandwich serves 4 people, then the number of sandwiches required is the total number of people divided by the number of people each sandwich serves. So, that would be 20 people divided by 4 people per sandwich.

Let me write that down:

Number of sandwiches = Total people / People per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

So, he needs to make 5 sandwiches to serve all 20 people.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, let's figure out the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

Calculating the cost for meat:
Cost of meat = Number of pounds of meat * Cost per pound
Cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Cost of meat = $35.00

Calculating the cost for cheese:
Cost of cheese = Number of pounds of cheese * Cost per pound
Cost of cheese = 5 * $3.00
Cost of cheese = $15.00

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of meat and the cost of cheese together.

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost = $50.000

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Number of sandwiches: 20 divided by 4 is 5. That seems right.

Meat per sandwich: 1 pound. So, 5 * 7 is 35. That's correct.

Cheese per sandwich: 1 pound. So, 5 * 3 is 15. That's correct.

Total cost: 35 + 15 is 50. Hmm, that's $50.00.

Wait, but the problem says each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, 5 sandwiches would require 5 pounds of each. So, 5 * 7 is 35, 5 * 3 is 15. 35 + 15 is 50. That seems correct.

But let me think again. Is there any other cost involved? The problem doesn't mention any other costs, like labor or other ingredients, so I think we're only considering the cost of meat and cheese.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the number of people. Let me check the problem again.

"Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people. There would be 20 people in total watching the game."

So, 20 people, each sandwich serves 4, so 5 sandwiches. That seems correct.

So, 5 * 7 is 35, 5 * 3 is 15, total is 50. So, $50.00.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the answer is written as A: but the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, the user just wrote the question and then the answer is to be filled in. So, maybe the answer is $50.00, which is $50.

But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of people. 20 people? 20 people. 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, 5 sandwiches. So, 5 * 7 is 35, 5 * 3 is 15, total is 50. So, $50.00.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, 5 * 7 is 35, 5 * 3 is 15, 35 +15 is 50. So, $50.00.
