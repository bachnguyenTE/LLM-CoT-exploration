Q: John does 30 cycles of work a day.  Each cycle has 5 different tasks and each task pays $1.20.  How much does he make if he works a full 7 day week?

Okay, so I have this problem here where John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 different tasks, and each task pays $1.20. I need to figure out how much he makes if he works a full 7-day week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what a cycle is. The problem says each cycle has 5 different tasks. So, if he does 30 cycles a day, that means he's doing 30 cycles multiplied by 5 tasks per cycle. Wait, hold on, 30 cycles a day? Or is it 30 cycles in total? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. It says "30 cycles of work a day." So, 30 cycles a day? Or is it 30 cycles in total? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "30 cycles of work a day." So, that would mean 30 cycles per day. So, each day, he does 30 cycles. Each cycle has 5 tasks, so each day, he does 30 cycles multiplied by 5 tasks. Let me write that down.

Number of cycles per day: 30
Number of tasks per cycle: 5
So, total tasks per day: 30 * 5 = 150 tasks.

Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings per day would be 150 tasks * $1.20 per task. Let me calculate that.

150 tasks would be 150 * 1.20. Wait, 150 is 150, so 150 * 1.20. Let me compute that.

1.20 times 100 is 120, and 1.20 times 50 is... Hmm, 1.20 * 50. Let me break that down: 1.20 * 50 is 60, and 0.010 * 50 is 5. So, 60 + 5 = 65. So, 1.20 * 50 is 65. So, 1.20 * 150 is 1.20*(100 + 50) = 120 + 65 = 185. So, $185 per day.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. 1.20 * 150. 1.20 * 100 is 120, 1.20 * 50 is 60, so 120 + 60 is 180. Wait, so 1.20 * 150 is 180? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 1.20 * 100 is 120, 1.20 * 50 is 60, so 120 + 60 is 180. So, 1.20 * 150 is 180. So, $180 per day? Wait, no, 1.20 * 150 is 180? Wait, 1.20 * 100 is 120, 1.20 * 50 is 60, so 120 + 60 is 180. So, $180 per day? Wait, no, 1.20 * 150 is 180? Wait, 1.20 * 150.

Wait, 1.20 * 100 is 120, 1.20 * 50 is 61. So, 120 + 61 is 181. So, $181 per day? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step.

1.20 multiplied by 150. Let's break it down:

150 is 100 + 50.

1.20 * 100 = 120

1.20 * 50: Let's compute 1.20 * 50.

1.20 * 50: 1.20 * 50.

First, 1.20 * 50.

1.20 * 50: 1.20 * 50 is 60, and 1.20 * 5 is 6. So, 6
