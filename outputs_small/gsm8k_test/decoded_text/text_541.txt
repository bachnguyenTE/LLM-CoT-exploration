Q: Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?

Okay, so I have this problem about Elvis and his monthly savings target. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Elvis has a target of $1125 each month. That's his total savings goal for the month. Now, in April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Hmm, so he's splitting his savings between two parts: the first half of April and the second half. 

Wait, April has 30 days, right? So, the first half would be the first 15 days, and the second half would be the last 15 days. So, he's saving for 15 days in the first half and 15 days in the second half. 

Let me denote the amount he saves each day in the first half as, let's say, x dollars. Then, according to the problem, in the second half, he saves twice as much daily. So, that would be 2x dollars per day in the second half. 

So, for the first half of April, he saves x dollars each day for 15 days. That means the total savings for the first half would be 15 times x, which is 15x. Similarly, for the second half, he saves 2x dollars each day for 15 days, so that's 15 times 2x, which is 30x. 

Wait, hold on, 15 times 2x is 30x? That seems a bit high. Let me check that again. 15 days times 2x dollars per day is indeed 30x. So, the total savings for the second half is 30x. 

Now, the total savings for the month should be the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half. So, that would be 15x + 30x. Let me add those together. 15x + 30x is 45x. 

But we know that Elvis's total monthly target is $1125. So, 45x equals 1125. To find x, we can divide both sides by 45. 

So, x equals 1125 divided by 45. Let me compute that. 45 goes into 1125 how many times? 

Well, 45 times 20 is 900. Subtracting that from 1125 gives 225. Then, 45 goes into 225 five times because 45 times 5 is 225. So, 20 plus 5 is 25. So, x is 25. 

So, x is 25 dollars. That means Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Then, in the second half, he saves twice that amount, which is 2 times 25, which is 50. 

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of April. 

Let me just double-check that. First half: 15 days times 25 is 375. Second half: 15 days times 50 is 750. Adding those together, 375 plus 750 is 1125, which matches his target. So, that seems correct. 

I think that's it. Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the total monthly target:** Elvis aims to save $1125 each month.

2. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - First half: 15 days.
   - Second half: 15 days.

3. **Let x be the daily savings in the first half.**
   - Daily savings in the second half: 2x.

4. **Calculate total savings for each half:**
   - First half: 15 days × x = 15x.
   - Second half: 15 days × 2x = 30x.

5. **Set up the equation for total savings:**
   - 15x + 30x = 1125.

6. **Solve for x:**
   - 45x = 1125.
   - x = 1125 / 45 = 25.

7. **Calculate daily savings in the second half:**
   - 2x = 2 × 25 =
