Q: Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. Then, Jenny eats 2 slices. I need to figure out how many slices are left. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the pizza has 12 slices. Jenny is giving away some slices to Bill and Mark. So, I need to calculate how many slices each of them gets. Let me start with Bill. He gets 1/3 of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, I can find 1/3 of 12 by dividing 12 by 3. Let me do that: 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, Bill gets 4 slices.

Next, Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza. Again, the pizza has 12 slices, so I need to find 1/4 of 12. To do that, I can divide 12 by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Mark gets 3 slices.

Now, I need to find out how many slices Jenny has left after giving some to Bill and Mark. She started with 12 slices. She gave 4 to Bill and 3 to Mark. So, I should subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total. Let me write that down: 12 minus 4 minus 3. 

Calculating that, 12 minus 4 is 8, and then 8 minus 3 is 5. So, Jenny has 5 slices left after giving some to Bill and Mark.

But wait, the problem also says that Jenny eats 2 slices. So, I need to subtract those 2 slices from the remaining 5. Let me do that: 5 minus 2 equals 3. So, after Jenny eats her 2 slices, there are 3 slices left.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 12 slices, giving 4 to Bill and 3 to Mark. 4 plus 3 is 7. 12 minus 7 is 5. Then, Jenny eats 2, so 5 minus 2 is 3. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any errors here. It's straightforward: subtract the portions given to Bill and Mark from the total, then subtract the slices Jenny eats. So, the final answer should be 3 slices left.

**Final Answer**
The number of slices left is \boxed{3}.

Jenny starts with a pizza divided into 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. 

First, we calculate the number of slices each person receives:
- Bill receives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12 slices: \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) slices.
- Mark receives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 12 slices: \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) slices.

Next, we subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
- Total slices given to Bill and Mark: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) slices.
- Slices remaining after giving to Bill and Mark: \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) slices.

Jenny then eats 2 slices:
- Slices remaining after Jenny eats: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) slices.

Thus, the number of slices left is \(\boxed{3}\).
