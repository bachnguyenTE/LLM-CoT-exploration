Q: Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, let me understand the problem. Alicia has to send her clothes to the dry cleaners weekly, and each week she drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt. The charges are $5.000 per blouse, $6.000 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. I need to calculate the total cost for 5 weeks.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the cost for one week first and then multiply it by 5 weeks. That makes sense because the weekly cost is consistent each week.

Let me write down the details:

- Blouses per week: 5
- Pants per week: 2
- Skirts per week: 1

Costs:

- Blouses: $5.000 each
- Pants: $8.00 each
- Skirts: $6.00 each

So, for one week, the cost would be:

Total cost = (Number of blouses * cost per blouse) + (Number of pants * cost per pants) + (Number of skirts * cost per skirt)

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost per week = (5 * $5.00) + (2 * $8.00) + (1 * $6.00)

Wait, hold on, the problem says $5.000 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. So, I think the cents are just part of the amount, so I should treat them as dollars. So, $5.00 is $5.00, $6.00 is $6.00, and $8.00 is $8.00.

So, let me compute each part:

Blouses: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Pants: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00

Skirts: 1 * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, adding these up for one week:

$25.00 + $16.000 + $6.000 = $47.00

Wait, that seems low. Let me check:

5 blouses at $5 each: 5*5=25, so $25.00

2 pants at $8 each: 2*8=16, so $16.00

1 skirt at $6: 1*6=6, so $6.00

Adding them: 25 + 16 is 41, plus 6 is 47. So, yes, $47.00 per week.

But wait, that seems a bit low for a dry cleaner. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check again.

"Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly. Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt. If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?"

Wait, so $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, $8.00 per pair of pants. So, that's correct.

So, 5 blouses: 5*5=25

2 pants: 2*8=16

1 skirt: 1*6=6

Total per week: 25 + 16 + 16 = 47? Wait, 25 + 16 is 31, plus 6 is 37? Wait, no, 25 + 16 is 31, plus 6 is 37? Wait, no, 25 + 16 is 41, plus 6 is 47? Wait, 25 + 16 is 31, plus 6 is 37? Wait, no, 25 + 16 is 41, plus 6 is 47? Wait, 25 + 16 is 41, plus 6 is 47. So, yes, $47 per week.

Wait, but 5 blouses at $5 each is 25, 2 pants at $8 each is 16, 1 skirt at $6 is 6. So, 25 + 16 is 31, plus 6 is 37? Wait, no
