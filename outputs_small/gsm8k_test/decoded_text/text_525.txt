Q: Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?

Okay, so Heather has a big bag of raisins, and she wants to make three different things: oatmeal cookies, granola, and a snack mix. The question is asking how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make if she divides the raisins equally among all three. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the total amount of raisins she has is 27 cups. She wants to split this equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and the snack mix. That means she's going to divide the 27 cups into three equal parts. So, I should probably figure out how much raisins each of these three items gets.

To do that, I can divide 27 by 3. Let me write that down: 27 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 27 nine times because 3 times 9 is 27. So, each of the three items gets 9 cups of raisins. That makes sense because if you split 27 into three equal parts, each part is 9.

Now, the question is specifically about how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, I need to figure out how many 3/4 cups fit into 9 cups of raisins.

To find out how many batches she can make, I can set up a division problem. The total amount of raisins she has for oatmeal cookies is 9 cups, and each batch requires 3/4 of a cup. So, the number of batches is 9 divided by 3/4.

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 9 divided by 3/4 is the same as 9 multiplied by 4/3. Let me compute that: 9 times 4 is 36, and 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12.

Wait, let me double-check that. If each batch is 3/4 cup, then 12 batches would be 3/4 + 3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 cups. So, 12 batches would be 3/4 * 2 = 6/4 = 1.5 cups. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 3/4 is 0.75. So, 0.75 times 12 is 1.5, which is 3/2. So, 12 batches would be 1.5 cups. But we have 9 cups. So, 9 divided by 0.75 is 12. Because 0.75 times 12 is 0.75, 0.75 times 2 is 1.5, and so on. So, 0.75 times 12 is 1.5, 0.75 times 12 is 9. So, yes, 12 batches.

Wait, but 12 batches of oatmeal cookies would require 12 times 0.75 cups of raisins. Let me compute that: 12 times 0.75. 10 times 0.75 is 7.5, and 2 times 0.75 is 1.5, so 7.5 + 1.5 is 9. So, yes, 12 batches would use up exactly 9 cups of raisins. So, that seems correct.

But let me think again. She's making oatmeal cookies, granola, and a snack mix, each getting 9 cups of raisins. So, for oatmeal cookies, she's using 9 cups, which allows for 12 batches. For granola and the snack mix, each also gets 9 cups, but the question is only asking about oatmeal cookies. So, the number of batches for oatmeal cookies is 12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says she wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. So, she's making three different things, each using the same amount of raisins, which is 9 cups each. So, for each of those, she's using 9 cups. So, for oatmeal cookies, she's using 9 cups, which allows for 12 batches. So, the answer is 12.

But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the total number of items she can make. But no, the question is specifically about oatmeal cookies. So, I think 12 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think about the
