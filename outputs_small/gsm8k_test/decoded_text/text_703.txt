Okay, so I have this problem here where Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends. There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there were no leftovers. I need to figure out how many dumplings Larry cooked in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let's figure out how many dumplings each male ate. The problem says each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more than that. So, if each female ate 3, then each male must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. That makes sense.

Now, there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all the females would be 6 multiplied by 3. Let me write that out: 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings. So, the females ate 18 dumplings in total.

Next, there are 8 males, and each of them ate 4 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males would be 8 multiplied by 4. That would be 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings. So, the males ate 32 dumplings in total.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, I need to add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males together. So, that would be 18 + 32. Let me calculate that: 18 + 32 = 50. So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings in total.

Wait, let me double-check that. Each female ate 3, so 6 females would be 6*3=18. Each male ate 4, so 8 males would be 8*4=32. 18+32=50. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using variables or something? Let me try that. Let’s denote the number of dumplings each female ate as F, which is 3. Then, each male ate F +1, which is 4. The number of females is 6, so total dumplings for females is 6*F. The number of males is 8, so total dumplings for males is 8*(F+1). Then, total dumplings would be 6*F + 8*(F+1). Plugging in F=3, that's 6*3 +8*4=18+32=50. Yep, same result.

So, I think 50 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems logical, and I double-checked it. So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

**Final Answer**
The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \boxed{50}.

Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends. There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there were no leftovers.

First, we determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. There are 6 females, so the total dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males. There are 8 males, so the total dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the females and the males together gives the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\).
