Q: Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Belen's pennies. She has two kinds: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and I need to find the combined weight of both pennies. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two pennies: one from 2010 and another from 1959. The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. So, if I let the weight of the 1959 penny be a certain value, the 2010 penny would be three-quarters of that. And since the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains, I can use that to find the weight of the 2010 penny and then add both together.

Let me write this down step by step.

Let’s denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W1959. According to the problem, W1959 = 48 grains.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. So, the weight of the 2010 penny, which I'll denote as W2210, is (3/4) * W1959.

So, substituting the value of W1959, we get:

W2210 = (3/4) * 48 grains.

Let me compute that. 3/4 of 48. Well, 48 divided by 4 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 3 is 36. So, W2210 is 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies, I need to add W1959 and W2210 together.

So, combined weight = W1959 + W2210 = 48 grains + 36 grains.

Adding those together, 48 + 36 is 84. So, the combined weight is 84 grains.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with fractions, it's easy to slip up.

So, W1959 is 48 grains. Three-quarters of that is 36 grains. Adding 48 and 36 gives 84. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 48 + 36. 40 + 30 is 70, and 8 + 6 is 14, so 70 +14 is 84. Yep, that's consistent.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using algebra or ratios?

Let me try that. Let’s denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W1 and the weight of the 2210 penny as W2.

Given that W2 = (3/4) * W1.

We know that W1 = 48 grains.

So, W2 = (3/4) * 48.

Calculating that, 48 divided by 4 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 3 is 36. So, W2 is 36 grains.

Therefore, the combined weight is W1 + W2 = 48 + 36 = 84 grains.

Same result. So, that seems solid.

Wait, just to make sure, is there a chance that the problem is referring to something else? Like, maybe the 2010 is three-quarters the weight of the 1959, but is that three-quarters by volume or weight? The problem says "the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny." So, it's definitely weight-wise. So, no, it's just a weight comparison.

So, I think I'm confident that 84 grains is the correct combined weight.

But just to be thorough, let me consider if grains are a unit of weight. In the avoirdupois system, a grain is 1/70 of an ounce, but in this case, it's just a unit of weight, so 48 grains is the weight of the 1959 penny, and 36 grains is the weight of the 2210 penny.

So, adding them together, 48 + 36 is 84 grains. So, the combined weight is 84 grains.

I think that's the answer.
