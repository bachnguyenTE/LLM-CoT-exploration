Q: Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3 miles farther than Lynn. How many miles did Lynn run?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley running together. The question is asking how many miles Lynn ran. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Paisley ran 4 miles. That seems straightforward. So, I can note that down:

Paisley's distance = 4 miles.

Next, it says Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. Hmm, okay. So, if Paisley ran 4 miles, then Reggie ran 5 times that distance. Let me write that out:

Reggie's distance = 5 × Paisley's distance.

Since we know Paisley ran 4 miles, that would be:

Reggie's distance = 5 × 4 = 20 miles.

Wait, hold on. 5 times 4 is 20? Yeah, that seems right. So, Reggie ran 20 miles.

But then it also says that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Hmm, okay. So, Reggie's distance is 3 miles more than Lynn's. So, if I let Lynn's distance be some variable, say L, then Reggie's distance would be L + 3.

But we already know Reggie's distance is 20 miles. So, setting up the equation:

L + 3 = 20.

So, to find L, we subtract 3 from both sides:

L = 20 - 3 = 17.

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Lynn ran 17 miles, then Reggie ran 17 + 3 = 20 miles, which is 5 times what Paisley ran (since 4 × 5 = 20). That seems to add up.

So, yeah, Lynn ran 17 miles.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times that, so 5 × 4 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so if Reggie is 20, then Lynn is 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

Yep, that all checks out. So, I think the answer is 17 miles.

**Final Answer**
Lynn ran \boxed{17} miles.

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

\[
\text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
\]

Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran. Then:

\[
L + 3 = 20
\]

Solving for \( L \):

\[
L = 20 - 3 = 17
\]

Thus, Lynn ran \boxed{17} miles.
