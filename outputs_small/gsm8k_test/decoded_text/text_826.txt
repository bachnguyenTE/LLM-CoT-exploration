Q: On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?

Okay, so Cindy went to the park for the Easter Egg Hunt and ended up with a basket full of eggs. The problem is asking how many eggs she had altogether. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out what information is given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.

Alright, so I need to find the total number of eggs she has, which is the sum of green, blue, pink, and yellow eggs. Let me break this down.

Starting with the green eggs: that's straightforward, it's 5.

Next, blue eggs. It says she had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Since green is 5, blue would be 2 times 5. Let me write that down:

Blue eggs = 2 * Green eggs = 2 * 5 = 10.

So, blue eggs are 10.

Now, moving on to pink eggs. It says she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, if blue eggs are 10, then pink eggs would be 10 minus 1. Let me calculate that:

Pink eggs = Blue eggs - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

So, pink eggs are 9.

Next, yellow eggs. It says she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Since pink eggs are 9, yellow eggs would be 1/3 of that. Let me compute that:

Yellow eggs = (1/3) * Pink eggs = (1/3) * 9 = 3.

So, yellow eggs are 3.

Now, to find the total number of eggs, I need to add up all the eggs: green, blue, pink, and yellow.

Let me write that out:

Total eggs = Green + Blue + Pink + Yellow.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3.

Wait, hold on, I just realized, blue eggs were 10, right? Because twice as many as green, which was 5. So, 5 green, 10 blue, 9 pink, and 3 yellow.

So, adding them up:

5 (green) + 10 (blue) = 15.

15 + 9 (pink) = 24.

24 + 3 (yellow) = 27.

So, total eggs are 27.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Green: 5.

Blue: 2 * 5 = 10. That seems right.

Pink: 10 - 1 = 9. Correct.

Yellow: 9 / 3 = 3. That's correct.

Adding them: 5 + 10 is 15, plus 9 is 24, plus 3 is 27. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, but let me think again. Sometimes, when problems mention "twice as many," it's easy to misinterpret. Is it twice as many as green, or green is half of blue? The problem says "twice as many blue ones as green ones," so blue is twice green, which is 5, so 10. That seems correct.

Similarly, pink is one fewer than blue, so 10 -1 =9. That's correct.

Yellow is one-third as many as pink, so 9 /3=3. Correct.

So, adding them all up: 5 +10 +9 +3=27.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using variables or equations.

Let me denote:

G = green eggs =5.

B = blue eggs =2G =2*5=10.

P = pink eggs = B -1=10 -1=9.

Y = yellow eggs = (1/3)P= (1/3)*9=3.

Total eggs = G + B + P + Y =5 +10 +9 +3=27.

Same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent all in terms of green eggs.

G=5.

B=2G=10.

P=B -1=10 -1=9.

Y=P/3=9/3=3.

Total=5+10+9+3=27.

Same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can write equations:

Let G =5.

B=2G.

P=B -1.

Y=P/3.

So, substituting:

B=2*5=10.

P=10 -1=9.

Y=9/3=3
