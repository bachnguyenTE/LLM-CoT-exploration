Q: 4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: 4 adults and 8 children are sharing 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet has 5 chocolate bars. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and the rest are to be shared equally among the children. I need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. There are 4 adults and 8 children, so that's a total of 12 people. They have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 times 5. Let me calculate that: 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars. So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Now, each adult is supposed to get 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6. Let me compute that: 4 *6 = 24. So, 24 chocolate bars are given to the adults.

That means the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children. The total number of chocolate bars is 40, and 24 are given to adults, so the remaining is 40 -24. Let me subtract: 40 -24 = 16. So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 divided by 8. Let me compute that: 16 /8 = 2. So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 8 packets, each with 5 bars: 8*5=40. Adults: 4*6=24. Remaining: 40-24=16. Divided by 8 children: 16/8=2. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me go through it again. Total chocolate bars: 8*5=40. Adults get 6 each: 4*6=24. So, 40-24=16. 16 divided by 8 is 2. So, each child gets 2. Hmm, that seems correct.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the total number of chocolate bars each child gets? Let me see. Each child gets 2, so 8 children would get 16, which is exactly the remaining chocolate bars. That makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think about the total number of chocolate bars each person gets. Adults get 6 each, children get 2 each. So, total per person: adults get 6, children get 2. So, the total per person is 6 +2=8. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the total number of people is 12, and 12*8=96, which is way more than 40. So, that approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I confused something. Let me think again. Each adult gets 6, so 4 adults get 24. Each child gets 2, so 8 children get 16. 24+16=40, which is the total number of chocolate bars. So, that works. So, each child gets 2.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 2.

**Final Answer**
Each child will get \boxed{2} chocolate bars.

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will receive. There are 4 adults, each getting 6 chocolate bars:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

These remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get \boxed{2} chocolate bars.
