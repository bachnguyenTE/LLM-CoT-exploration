Q: Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Manny signing up for Karate classes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents are telling him that if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 total classes. The question is, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. Manny has already paid $60 for all 10 classes. But his parents are concerned about the cost per class. They want to make sure that each class doesn't cost more than $10. So, if the total cost per class exceeds $10, he won't sign him up again. 

Wait, so the total cost is $60, and there are 10 classes. So, the average cost per class is $60 divided by 10, which is $6 per class. That's way below $10, so why are they worried? Maybe they're thinking that if he misses some classes, the cost per class might go up? Or maybe they're calculating something else.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says, "if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again." Wait, hold on, is that $10 or $11? The problem says $10 per class, so it's $10? Wait, no, let me check.

No, the problem says, "if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again." So, it's $110? Wait, no, the problem says "if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again." So, it's $10 per class? Wait, no, the problem says "if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again." So, it's $10 per class.

Wait, but the total cost is $60 for 10 classes. So, the average cost per class is $6. So, if he misses some classes, the total cost would increase, but the number of classes he's paying for would decrease. So, the average cost per class would go up.

So, the problem is asking, how many classes can he miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10. So, the total cost would be $60, and the number of classes he's paying for would be 10 minus the number of classes he misses. So, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the average cost per class is still $10 or less.

Wait, so let me define some variables. Let me let x be the number of classes he misses. Then, the number of classes he's paying for is 10 - x. The total cost is still $60, so the average cost per class would be 60 divided by (10 - x). We need this average cost to be less than or equal to $10.

So, the inequality would be:

60 / (10 - x) ≤ 10

We need to solve for x.

So, let's write that down:

60 / (10 - x) ≤ 10

But wait, 10 - x is in the denominator, so we have to be careful about the direction of the inequality when we multiply both sides by (10 - x). But since (10 - x) is in the denominator, we have to consider whether it's positive or negative.

But since x is the number of classes he can miss, x has to be less than 10, because he can't miss more than all the classes. So, x is between 0 and 10. So, 10 - x is positive because x is less than 10. So, we can multiply both sides by (10 - x) without changing the inequality direction.

So, 60 ≤ 10*(10 - x)

Simplify the right side:

60 ≤ 100 -10x

Now, subtract 100 from both sides:

60 -100 ≤ -10x

Which is:

-40 ≤ -10x

Now, divide both sides by -10. But remember, when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.

So, dividing both sides by -10:

-40 / -10 ≥ x

Which simplifies to:

4 ≥ x

So, x ≤4

So, x is less
