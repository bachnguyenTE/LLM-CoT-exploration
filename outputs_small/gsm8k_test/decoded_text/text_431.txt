Q: Dora wants to buy a skipping rope that costs $6, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. How much more money does Dora need to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these amounts together gives a total of $19.

Next, I'll calculate how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and received $16 from her mother, which adds up to $18.

Finally, to find out how much more money Dora needs, I'll subtract the amount she currently has from the total cost of the items. This means she needs $1 more.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   \[
   \$6 \ (\text{skipping rope}) + \$11 \ (\text{board game}) + \$2 \ (\text{playground ball}) = \$19
   \]

2. **Determine how much money Dora currently has:**
   \[
   \$2 \ (\text{saved}) + \$16 \ (\text{from mother}) = \$18
   \]

3. **Find out how much more money Dora needs:**
   \[
   \$19 \ (\text{total cost}) - \$18 \ (\text{current savings}) = \$1
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1}
\]
