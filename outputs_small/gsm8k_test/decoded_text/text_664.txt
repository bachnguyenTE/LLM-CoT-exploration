Q: John decides to take a cooking class.  The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, how many recipes does he learn?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John taking a cooking class, and I need to figure out how many recipes he learns. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that John decides to take a cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, I need to calculate the total number of class hours John spends. Then, it mentions that he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, I guess I need to figure out how many 1.5-hour segments are in his total class time. That should give me the number of recipes he learns.

Alright, let's start with the total class time. The class meets 4 times a week, and each session is 2 hours long. So, to find the total hours, I can multiply the number of sessions by the duration of each session. That would be 4 times 2. Let me write that down:

Total class hours = Number of sessions × Duration per session
Total class hours = 4 × 2
Total class hours = 8 hours

Okay, so John spends a total of 8 hours in the cooking class. Now, he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, I need to figure out how many 1.5-hour blocks are in 8 hours. To do that, I can divide the total class hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe.

Number of recipes = Total class hours ÷ Time per recipe
Number of recipes = 8 ÷ 1.5

Hmm, let me compute that. 8 divided by 1.5. Hmm, 1.5 goes into 8 how many times? Well, 1.5 times 5 is 7.5, and 1.5 times 6 is 9. So, 1.5 times 5 is 7.5, which is less than 8, and 1.5 times 6 is 9, which is more than 8. So, it must be between 5 and 6. Let me do the division more precisely.

8 divided by 1.5. To make this easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. So, 80 divided by 15. 15 goes into 80 how many times? 15 times 5 is 75, which is less than 80, and 15 times 6 is 90, which is too much. So, 5 times 15 is 75, subtract that from 80, you get 5. So, 5 with a remainder of 5. So, 5 and 5/15, which simplifies to 5 and 1/3. So, 5.333... recipes.

But wait, you can't really learn a third of of a recipe, right? So, does that mean he learns 5 full recipes and a bit more, or does he learn 5 full recipes and a partial one? Hmm, the problem says he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours. So, if he has 8 hours, and each recipe takes 1.5 hours, how many full recipes can he learn?

So, 1.5 hours per recipe. So, 1.5 times 5 is 7.5 hours, which is 7 and a half hours. Then, he has 0.5 hours left, which is 30 minutes. Since 1.5 hours is 90 minutes, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. So, he can't learn another full recipe because 30 minutes is less than 90 minutes. So, he can only learn 5 full recipes.

Wait, but hold on, maybe I should think about it differently. If he learns a recipe every 1.5 hours, then the number of recipes is equal to the total time divided by 1.5. So, 8 divided by 1.5 is 5.333... So, that's 5 and 1/3 recipes. But since you can't have a third of a recipe, does that mean he learns 5 full recipes and a partial one, or does he learn 5 full recipes and a partial one, but since you can't have a partial recipe, maybe it's 5 full recipes?

Wait, the problem says "how many recipes does he learn?" So, if he can learn a partial recipe, does that count as a full recipe? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether partial recipes are counted or not. It just says "a new recipe for every 1.5 hours." So, if he has 8 hours, and each recipe takes 1.5 hours
