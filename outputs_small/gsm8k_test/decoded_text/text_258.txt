Okay, so I need to figure out how much Nancy has to pay for her overdue books. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Nancy owes $0.50 cents on each of 8 books, plus a flat fee of $2.000 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Hmm, wait, the cents part is a bit confusing. It says $0.50 cents each. So, is that $0.50 or $0.50? Maybe it's a typo, and it should be $0.50? Or perhaps it's $0.50? Let me think.

Wait, the problem says $0.50 cents each. So, that would be 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, each book is $0.50 overdue. So, 8 books at $0.50 each. Then, plus a flat fee of $2.00. Wait, that seems like a typo too. It should probably be $2.00 or $2.000? Maybe $2.00? Let me check the original problem again.

It says: "Nancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?"

So, the cents part is $0.50 cents each. So, that's 55 cents, which is $0.55. So, each book is $0.55. Then, the flat fee is $2.00. So, maybe it's $2.00? Or is it $2.000? Hmm, maybe it's $2.00. Let me go with $2.00 for now.

So, first, calculate the cost for the books. She has 8 books, each costing $0.55. So, 8 times 0.55. Let me compute that.

0.55 multiplied by 8. Let me do 0.55 * 8. 0.55 * 8 is equal to 4.40. So, the total for the books is $4.40.

Then, there's a flat fee of $2.000. So, that's $2.00. So, add that to the $4.40.

So, 4.40 + 2.000 is 6.40. So, total amount she has to pay is $6.40.

Wait, let me double-check. 8 books at $0.55 each: 8 * 0.55. 0.55 * 8. 0.55 * 10 is 5.50, so 0.55 * 8 is 4.40. Then, plus $2.00. 4.40 + 2.00 is 6.40. That seems right.

But wait, let me make sure I interpreted the cents correctly. The problem says $0.50 cents each. So, 55 cents each. So, $0.55 each. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it was $0.50 cents each, that would be $0.50 each, which is 50 cents. But the problem says cents, so it's 55 cents. So, $0.55 each.

So, 8 books at $0.55 each is 8 * 0.55 = 4.40. Then, plus $2.00, so total is 6.40.

Wait, but the problem says "a flat $2.00 fee." So, is that $2.0 or $2.00? Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be $2.00. So, $2.00 is 2 dollars and 20 cents, which is $2.20. Wait, no, 20 cents is $0.02. So, $2.00 is $2.00, which is $2.00, which is 2 dollars and 20 cents? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 2.00 is 2 dollars and 20 cents? Wait, no, 2.00 is 2 dollars and 20 cents? Wait, no, 2.00 is 2 dollars, 2.00 is 2 dollars, 2.00 is 2 dollars and 20 cents?
