Q: Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese.  How much money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, Bud makes it once a week. That means he does this 52 times a year, right? So, I should calculate his weekly expenses and then multiply by 52 to get the annual total.

Let me list out the costs he has each week. He buys pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese. 

1. **Pasta:** The pasta costs $1.00 a box. So, each week, he spends $1.00 on pasta.

2. **Cheddar Cheese:** He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week. That's straightforward.

3. **Gruyere Cheese:** The problem says he spends twice the amount he spends on cheddar cheese. Cheddar is $3.00, so twice that would be 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Got it.

So, adding up his weekly expenses: pasta ($1.00) + cheddar ($3.00) + gruyere ($6.00). Let me add those up.

First, pasta and cheddar: $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00. Then, add the gruyere: $4.00 + $6.00 = $10.00. Wait, that can't be right. $1.00? That seems low. Let me check my math.

Wait, $1.00 pasta, $3.00 cheddar, and $6.00 gruyere. So, 1 + 3 is 4, plus 6 is 10. Yeah, that's correct. So, he spends $10.00 each week.

Now, to find out how much he spends in a year, I need to multiply his weekly expense by 52 weeks. So, $10.00/week * 52 weeks.

Let me compute that. 10 * 52 is 520. So, $520.00 per year.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my weekly cost. Maybe I misread the problem.

He spends $1.000 pasta, $3.000 cheddar, and twice that amount for gruyere. So, twice $3.00 is $6.00. So, pasta is $1, cheddar is $3, gruyere is $6. So, total is 1 + 3 + 6 = $10. So, that's correct.

So, 52 weeks * $10.00 per week is indeed $520.00. Hmm, that seems correct. Maybe I was just doubting myself unnecessarily.

Alternatively, let me think about it another way. If he spends $10 each week, then over 52 weeks, it's 52 * 10 = 520. So, $520.00.

Wait, but let me make sure that the problem is asking for the total he spends on making the macaroni and cheese, not just the cost of the ingredients. So, he makes it once a week, but does he have any other costs associated with making it? The problem doesn't mention any other expenses, so I think it's just the cost of the pasta, cheese, and gruyere.

Therefore, his total weekly cost is $10.00, and over a year, that's $520.00.

So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me recast the problem.

He makes it once a week. Each time, he spends:

- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar: $3.00
- Gruyere: $6.00

Total per week: 1 + 3 + 6 = 10. So, $10.00 per week.

Number of weeks in a year: 52.

Total annual cost: 10 * 52 = 520. So, $520.00.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of multiplication:

10 * 52 = ?

10 * 50 = 550

10 * 2 = 20

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 52 is 50 + 2.

So, 10 * 50 = 500

10 * 2 = 20

So, 500 + 20 = 520.
