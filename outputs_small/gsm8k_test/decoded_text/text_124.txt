Q: Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

Okay, so Jennie is helping at her mom's office, and she has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She's going to put stamps on one-third of them. After that, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The question is asking how many letters were in that pile when Jennie began.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, initially, there are 60 letters needing stamps. Jennie is putting stamps on one-third of them. So, first, I need to figure out how many letters she's actually stamping. One-third of 60 is... let me calculate that. 60 divided by 3 is 22. So, she's stamping 22 letters.

Now, she's adding these 22 letters to the pile that's already stamped. So, the pile that was already stamped must have been 22 letters before she started stamping. But wait, the problem says that after she adds the stamps, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Hmm, so does that mean the pile was 22 before, and then she added 22 more, making it 44? But the problem says there are now 30 letters in the pile. That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, "She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?"

So, initially, there are two piles: one of 60 needing stamps, and another pile that's already stamped. She's adding stamps to one-third of the needing-stamps pile. So, she's adding 22 letters to the already-stamped pile, making the total already-stamped pile 22 + 22 = 44. But the problem says there are now 30 letters in the pile. That doesn't make sense because 44 is more than 30.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the pile of already-stamped letters includes both the original pile and the ones she added. So, initially, there are some letters already stamped. Then, she adds 22 more, making the total 30. So, if the total is 30, then the original pile must have been 30 - 22 = 8. But that seems too low.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the pile of already-stamped letters includes both the original pile and the ones she added. So, if she added 22 letters, and the total is 30, then the original pile must have been 30 -22 = 8. But that seems too small because she started with 60 letters needing stamps, and she's only adding 22. So, the pile of already-stamped letters would be 60 -22 +22 =60. But the problem says it's 30. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the pile of already-stamped letters is the original pile plus the ones she added. So, if the total is 30, and she added 22, then the original pile must have been 30 -22 =8. But that seems inconsistent because she started with 60 needing stamps, so the pile of already-stamped letters should be 60 -22 +22 =80. But the problem says it's 30. So, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to model it with equations.

Let me denote:

Let x be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

She is adding one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is (1/3)*60 =22 letters.

So, after adding, the pile of already-stamped letters becomes x +22.

But the problem says that after adding, the pile is 30 letters. So, x +22 =30.

Therefore, solving for x, we get x=30 -22=8.

So, the pile was 8 letters when she started.

But wait, that seems low because she started with 60 needing stamps, so the pile of already-stamped letters should be 60 -22 +22=60. But the problem says it's 30. So, that's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the pile of already-stamped letters includes both the original pile and the ones she added. So, if the pile is 30, and she added 22
