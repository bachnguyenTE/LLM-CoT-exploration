Q: Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost to paint the room?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much it will cost Tony to paint his room. Let me see, the room has four walls: north, south, east, and west. The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet each, and the east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet each. Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably calculate the area of each wall to know how much paint Tony needs.

Let me start with the north and south walls. Each of these walls is 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one wall is length times height, which is 10 * 8. Let me write that down: 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two walls (north and south), I need to multiply this by 2. So, 80 * 2 = 164 square feet. Okay, so the north and south walls together cover 164 square feet.

Now, moving on to the east and west walls. Each of these walls is 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. So, the area of one wall is 5 * 8. Let me calculate that: 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. There are two of these walls, so I need to multiply this by 2 as well. So, 40 * 2 = 80 square feet. Wait, hold on, 5*8 is 40? No, that's not right. 5*8 is actually 40? Wait, no, 5*8 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. So, 40 * 2 is 80 square feet. So, the east and west walls together cover 80 square feet.

Now, to find the total area of all four walls, I need to add the area of the north and south walls and the area of the east and west walls. So, that's 164 + 80. Let me add those together: 164 + 80. Hmm, 164 + 80 is 244 square feet. So, the total area of the walls is 244 square feet.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. North and south walls: 10*8=80 each, so 80*2=160. East and west walls: 5*8=40 each, so 40*2=80. So, 160 +80=240. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 10*8 is 80, times 2 is 160. 5*8 is 40, times 2 is 80. So, 160 +80 is 240. Okay, so that's 240 square feet total. I think I messed up my initial calculation. So, the total area is 240 square feet.

Now, the paint can covers 20 square feet per gallon, and each gallon costs $12. So, I need to figure out how many gallons Tony needs to paint all the walls. To do that, I can divide the total area by the coverage per gallon. So, 240 divided by 20. Let me compute that: 240 /20=12. So, Tony needs 12 gallons of paint.

Wait, hold on, 240 divided by 20 is 12. So, 12 gallons. Each gallon is $12, so the total cost would be 12 *12. Let me calculate that: 12*12=144. So, the total cost is $144.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the area calculation. North and south walls: 10*8=80 each, so 160 total. East and west walls:5*8=40 each, so 80 total. 160+80=240. Yeah, that's correct. So, 240 square feet. 240 divided by 20 is 12. 12 gallons. 12*12 is 144. So, $144.

Wait, but hold on, is there any chance that the paint can't be applied partially? Like, if you have a partial gallon, you still need to buy a full gallon. But since 240 is exactly divisible by 20, so 12 gallons is exact. So, no partial gallons needed. So, 12 gallons is sufficient.

So, the cost is 1
