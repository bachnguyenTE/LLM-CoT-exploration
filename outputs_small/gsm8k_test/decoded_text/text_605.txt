Q: For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.  How much money did Patrick earn, in dollars, from selling lemonade for 6 hours?

Okay, so Patrick is selling lemonade, and I need to figure out how much money he earned over six hours. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the problem says that Patrick sold lemonade for four hours. During those four hours, he sold 15 cups per hour at a price of $0.50 each. Then, in the next two hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at a higher price of $0.60 each. So, in total, he worked for six hours, right? Let me confirm that: 4 hours plus 2 hours is 6 hours. Yep, that adds up.

Now, I need to calculate how much money he made in each of those time periods and then add them together to get the total earnings. I think the best way to approach this is to calculate the earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

Starting with the first four hours. He sold 15 cups each hour at $0.50 per cup. So, to find the total earnings for this period, I can multiply the number of cups by the price per cup. That is, 15 cups multiplied by $0.50. Let me write that down:

First period earnings = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours

Wait, hold on, 15 cups per hour? Wait, no, the problem says 15 cups per hour. So, 15 cups/hour. So, 15 cups/hour * $0.50 per cup. So, 15 * 0.50.

Let me compute that. 15 times 0.50. Hmm, 15 times 0 is 15, and 15 times 0.50 is 15 * 0.50, which is 7.50. So, 15 cups at $0.50 each is $7.50. So, that's the first four hours.

Now, moving on to the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, similar approach: 10 cups/hour * $0.60 per cup * 2 hours.

Calculating that: 10 * 0.60 is 6.00, and then multiplied by 2 hours is 12.00. So, $12.00 for the next two hours.

Now, to find the total earnings, I need to add the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours. So, $7.50 plus $12.00.

Let me add those together: 7.50 + 1.00 is 8.50, and then plus another 1.00 is 9.50. So, $9.50 in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up.

First period: 15 cups at $0.50 each. 15 * 0.50 is indeed 7.50. That seems right because 10 cups would be $5.00, and 5 cups would be $2.50, so 5.00 + 2.50 is 7.50. Okay, that checks out.

Second period: 10 cups at $0.60 each. 10 * 0.60 is 6.60. Then, multiplied by 2 hours is 13.20. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 10 cups at $0.60 per cup is 10 * 0.60. Let me compute that again.

10 * 0.60 is 6.60. So, 10 cups at $0.60 is $6.60. Then, over two hours, that's 2 * 6.60, which is 13.20. Wait, but that seems high. Wait, 10 cups at $0.60 is 10 * 0.60. Let me compute 10 * 0.60. 10 * 0.60 is 6.60. So, 10 cups at $0.60 is $6.60, so over two hours, it's 2 * 6.60, which is 13.20. So, that's $13.20.

Wait,
