Q: Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Lloyd makes from his egg farm each week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that his chickens produce 252 eggs every day. That seems straightforward. Now, he sells them for $2 per dozen. Wait, a dozen is 12, right? So, $2 per dozen means how much does one egg cost? Let me calculate that. If a dozen is $2, then each egg must be 2 divided by 12. Let me do that: 2 ÷ 12 equals... 1/6. So, each egg is a dollar and five cents? Wait, no, 1/6 of a dollar is approximately 16.666... cents. So, each egg is about 6.67 cents. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but okay, maybe that's correct.

But wait, maybe I don't need to calculate the cost per egg. Maybe I can figure out how much he makes per egg and then multiply by the number of eggs he sells each week. Let me think. If he sells 252 eggs a day at $2 per dozen, how much is that per day?

So, first, let's find out how many dozens are in 252 eggs. Since a dozen is 12, I can divide 252 by 12. Let me do that: 252 ÷ 12. Hmm, 12 times 21 is 252, right? So, 21. So, 252 eggs is 21 dozen. So, 21 dozen. So, if each dozen is $2, then 21 dozen would be 21 times $2, which is $22. So, he makes $22 per day.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. 252 eggs divided by 12 is 21, so 21 dozen. 21 times $2 is $22. So, yes, that's correct. So, he makes $22 per day.

But wait, is that right? Because 252 eggs at $2 per dozen. So, 252 divided by 12 is 21, so 21 times 2 is 42. So, yes, $42 per day. Wait, hold on, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? No, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? No, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, no, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42. Oh, okay, I think I messed up the multiplication. 21 times 2 is 42? No, 21 times 2 is 42? Wait, 21 times 2 is 42. So, 21 times 2 is 42. So, he makes $42 per day.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, 252 eggs divided by 12 is 21, so 21 times 2 is 42. So, $42 per day. Okay, that seems better.

So, if he makes $42 per day, then over a week, which is 7 days, he would make 42 times 7. Let me calculate that. 42 times 7. 40 times 7 is 280, and 2 times 7 is 14, so 280 plus 14 is 294. So, $294 per week.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 42 times 7: 40 times 7 is 280, 2 times 7 is 14, so 280 +14 is 294. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 42 times 7 as 40 times 7 is 280, and 2 times 7 is 14, so 280 +14 is 294. So, that's correct.

So, putting it all together: 252 eggs per day, which is 21 dozen, so 21 times $2 is $
