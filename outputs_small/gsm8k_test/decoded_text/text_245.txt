Q: There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?

Okay, so I have this problem here about snails and fish in two aquariums. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. So, that's straightforward—4 and 32 snails respectively. Then it mentions that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. It also says that both aquariums have the same number of fish. So, I need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, each has F fish. 

Now, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4, which is 28 snails. The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, the difference in snails is 28, and that's equal to twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Wait, let me make sure I understand that correctly. The difference in snails is 28, and that's equal to twice the total number of fish. So, 28 = 2 * (number of fish in both aquariums). 

But the number of fish in both aquariums is F + F, which is 2F. So, substituting that in, we get 28 = 2 * (2F). Let me write that out:

28 = 2 * (2F)

Simplifying the right side, 2 times 2F is 4F. So, 28 = 4F.

To find F, I can divide both sides by 4. So, F = 28 / 4, which is 7. 

Wait, so each aquarium has 7 fish? Let me check that again. If each aquarium has 7 fish, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is 14. The difference in snails is 28, and 28 is twice the total fish, which is 14. Wait, that doesn't add up. 28 is not equal to 2*14. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again. It says, "the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums." So, the difference in snails is 28, and that is equal to twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, 28 = 2*(fish in both aquariums). 

But the fish in both aquariums is F + F, which is 2F. So, 28 = 2*(2F). So, 28 = 4F, so F = 7. But when I plug it back in, 2*(2F) is 4F, which is 28, so F is 7. So, each aquarium has 7 fish. 

But wait, the difference in snails is 28, which is twice the total fish, which is 14. 28 is not equal to 14. So, that doesn't make sense. So, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, let me read it again: "the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums." So, difference in snails is 28, which is equal to twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, 28 = 2*(fish in both aquariums). So, fish in both aquariums is 14. So, each aquarium has 7 fish. So, 7 fish in each aquarium.

But then, 2*(fish in both aquariums) is 14, which is not equal to 28. So, that's a problem. So, maybe my initial interpretation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the difference in snails is twice the amount of fish in each aquarium? So, 28 = 2*(fish in each aquarium). So, 28 = 2*F. So, F = 14. So, each aquarium has 14 fish. Then, the total fish in both aquariums is 28, which is twice the difference in snails, which is 28. So, 28 = 2*14, which is 28. That works.

Wait, so maybe I misread the problem. It says, "the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of
