Q: Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 for each cupcake and  40  cookies at $1 each.  She buys five trays at $4 for each tray. How much money does Frances have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total amount of money Frances earns from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, which amounts to 20 multiplied by $2, totaling $40.

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, which amounts to 40 multiplied by $1, totaling $40.

Adding these together, Frances earns a total of $80.

Next, I need to determine how much she spends on buying the trays of baked goods.

She buys five trays at $4 each, which amounts to 5 multiplied by $4, totaling $20.

Finally, to find out how much money Frances has left, I subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she earned.

$80 minus $20 equals $68.

Therefore, Frances has $68 left.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes and cookies:**

   - **Cupcakes:**
     \[
     20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40
     \]
   
   - **Cookies:**
     \[
     40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40
     \]
   
   - **Total Earnings:**
     \[
     \$40 + \$40 = \$80
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying the trays:**
   
   \[
   5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{ trays} = \$20
   \]

3. **Determine the money left after expenses:**
   
   \[
   \$80 - \$20 = \$68
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
