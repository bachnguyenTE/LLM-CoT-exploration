Q: Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. How many points did Pierson and Nikita have in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Pierson and Nikita's bowling scores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Pierson scored 278 points in one game. That seems straightforward. So, Pierson's score is 278. Got that down. 

Now, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Hmm, okay, so I need to break this down. Let me think about what "half as many as Pierson" means. If Pierson scored 278, half of that would be... let me calculate that. 

Half of 278 is 278 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 278 divided by 2. Well, 2 goes into 2 once, 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, and then 2 goes into 18 nine times. So, 278 divided by 2 is 139. So, half of Pierson's score is 139. 

But Nikita scored 11 more than that. So, I need to add 11 to 139. Let me add those together. 139 plus 11. That should be 150. Wait, is that right? 139 plus 10 is 150, so yeah, 150. So, Nikita scored 150 points. 

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. 139 plus 11. 139 plus 10 is 150, and then plus another 1 is 151. Wait, no, that's not right. 139 plus 11 is 150. Wait, no, 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, 139 plus 1 is 140, plus another 1 is 141. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, no, 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, 139 plus 11 is 150? Let me add it again. 139 plus 11. 9 plus 1 is 10, so carry over 1. 3 plus 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 is 5. So, 150. Wait, no, 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, 139 plus 10 is 149, plus 1 is 150. Yes, that's correct. So, Nikita scored 150 points. 

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. 139 plus 11. 139 plus 10 is 149, plus 1 is 150. So, yes, 150. So, Nikita scored 150 points. 

So, Pierson scored 278, Nikita scored 150. The question is asking for the total points they had in both games. So, I need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score together. 

So, 278 plus 150. Let me add those. 278 plus 150. 200 plus 100 is 300, 70 plus 50 is 120, and 8 plus 0 is 8. So, 300 plus 120 is 420, plus 8 is 428. So, the total is 428. 

Wait, let me do it another way to make sure. 278 plus 150. 278 plus 100 is 378, plus 50 is 428. Yeah, that's the same. So, the total points they scored together is 428. 

So, just to recap: Pierson scored 278, Nikita scored 150, total is 428. 

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought Nikita scored 150. Let me check that again. Half of Pierson's score is 139, and Nikita scored 11 more than that, so 139 plus 11 is 150. So, Nikita scored 150
