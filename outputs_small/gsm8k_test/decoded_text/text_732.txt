Q: Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Dora, her father, and her mother's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says, "Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age." Hmm, okay. So, if I let Dora's age be a variable, maybe I can write an equation for that. Let me denote Dora's age as D. So, Dora is 15 years old, as given. 

So, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. That translates to: Father's age = 2 * D + 8. Since Dora is 15, that would be 2*15 + 8. Let me calculate that. 2*15 is 30, plus 8 is 38. So, Dora's father is 38 years old. 

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If Dora is 15, twice that is 30, plus 8 is 38. Yeah, that seems right. So, father is 38.

Next, the problem says, "Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father." So, if the father is 38, then the mother is 38 - 4. Let me compute that. 38 minus 4 is 34. So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, the question is asking for the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. So, I need to add up all three ages: Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age.

So, Dora is 15, father is 38, mother is 34. Let me add them up. 15 + 38 + 34. Hmm, let me do this step by step. 15 + 38 is 53, and then 53 + 34 is 87. So, the total combined age is 87 years.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, Dora is 15. Father is 2*15 +8, which is 10 +8=18? Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 2*15 is 30, plus 8 is 38. Yeah, that's correct. So, father is 38.

Mother is 38 -4=34. So, mother is 34. 

Adding them up: 15 +38=53, 53 +34=87. Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 53 +34 is 87? Wait, 5
