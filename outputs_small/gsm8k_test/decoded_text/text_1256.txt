Q: The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?

Okay, so I have this problem about Phineas Frog who needs to return home after being flooded. He has to hop on land and swim through water. The total distance he needs to cover is 200 yards, but half of that is on land and half is in water. I need to figure out how long it will take him to get back home, given that he hops on land at 20 yards per minute and swims at 10 yards per minute.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The total distance is 200 yards, which I think is 220 yards. Half of that is on land, so that's 110 yards, and the other half is in water, which is another 110 yards. So, he has to cover 110 yards on land and 110 yards in water.

Now, he hops on land at 20 yards per minute. That means his speed on land is 20 yards per minute. So, to find out how long it takes him to hop 110 yards on land, I can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, for the land part, the time would be 110 yards divided by 20 yards per minute. Let me calculate that.

110 divided by 20 is 5. Wait, 20 times 5 is 100, so 110 is 10 yards more. So, 10 divided by 20 is 0.5 minutes. So, total time on land is 5 + 0.5 = 5.5 minutes.

Similarly, for the water part, he swims 110 yards at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, using the same formula:

Time = 110 / 10 = 11 minutes.

So, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time on land and the time swimming. That would be 5.5 minutes + 11 minutes.

Let me add those together. 5.5 + 11 is 16.5 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, total distance is 220 yards. Half is 110 yards on land, half is 110 yards in water. So, 110 divided by 20 is 5.5 minutes. 110 divided by 10 is 11 minutes. 5.5 + 11 is indeed 16.5 minutes.

Hmm, 16.5 minutes is the same as 16 minutes and 30 seconds. But since the question asks for the time in minutes, I can just write it as 16.5 minutes.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the problem saying that half the distance is on land and half is in water? So, 220 yards total, so 110 yards on land, 110 yards in water. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as two separate legs of the journey: one on land and one in water. So, each leg is 110 yards, but different speeds.

So, for the land leg: 110 yards at 20 yards per minute. So, time is 110 / 20. Wait, hold on, 110 divided by 20 is 5.05 minutes? Wait, no, 20 times 5 is 100, so 110 is 10 yards more, so 110 /20 is 5.5 minutes. Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, 20 yards per minute, so 1 yard per 0.05 minutes. So, 110 yards would be 110 * 0.05 minutes, which is 5.5 minutes. So, that's correct.

Similarly, 10 yards per minute, so 110 yards is 111 /10 = 11 minutes.

So, 5.5 + 11 is 16.5 minutes.

Wait, 16.5 minutes is 16 minutes and 30 seconds, but since the question is in minutes, I can write it as 16.5 minutes.

Alternatively, 16.5 minutes is the same as 16 minutes and 30 seconds, but since the question doesn't specify, 16.5 is fine.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the total distance 220 yards? So, 110 on land, 110 in water. So, 1
