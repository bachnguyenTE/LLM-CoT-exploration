Q: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rani, Monic, and Bo, and they all have crabs. The question is asking me to find the total number of crabs they have together. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says, "Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together." Hmm, okay. So, Bo has 40 crabs, and then Monic has 4 fewer than that. Then Rani has 10 more than Monic. So, I need to figure out how many crabs each of them has and then add them all up.

Let me write down what I know:

- Bo has 40 crabs. That's straightforward.

- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, if Bo has 40, Monic must have 40 minus 4. Let me calculate that: 40 - 4 = 36. So, Monic has 36 crabs.

- Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36, Rani must have 36 + 10. Let me do that addition: 36 + 10 = 46. So, Rani has 46 crabs.

Now, to find the total number of crabs, I need to add up the crabs each person has. That would be Bo's 40, Monic's 36, and Rani's 46.

Let me add them one by one. First, 40 + 36. Hmm, 40 + 30 is 70, and then +6 is 76. So, 40 + 36 = 80? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 40 + 36 is actually 76? Wait, no, 40 + 36 is 76? Wait, 40 + 30 is 70, plus 6 is 76. Yeah, that's correct. So, 40 + 36 is 76.

Then, add Rani's 46 to that. So, 76 + 46. Let me do that. 70 + 40 is 110, and 6 + 6 is 12. So, 110 + 12 is 12. So, 110 + 12 is 122. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 76 + 46. Let me do it another way. 76 + 40 is 116, and then +6 is 122. Yeah, that's correct. So, 76 + 46 is 122.

Wait, but 76 + 46 is 122? Let me check that again. 76 + 46: 70 + 40 is 110, and 6 + 6 is 12, so 110 + 12 is 122. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total number of crabs is 122.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me go through each step again.

Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than that, so 40 - 4 = 36. Rani has 10 more than Monic, so 36 +10 =46. Then, adding them all together: 40 +36 +46.

Wait, hold on, 40 +36 is 76, and 76 +46 is 122. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total number of crabs is 122.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using variables or equations? Let me try that.

Let me denote the number of crabs each person has as variables:

Let B = number of crabs Bo has.

M = number of crabs Monic has.

R = number of crabs Rani has.

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.

Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so M = B -4.

Rani has 10 more than Monic, so R = M +10.

So, substituting the values:

M = 40 -4 =36.

R =36 +10=46.
