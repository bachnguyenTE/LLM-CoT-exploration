Q: Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. How many birds does he count in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many birds Jerry counts in total. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. How many birds does he count in total?"

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. That seems straightforward. So, that's 6 birds.

Next, it says 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead. Hmm, so that means out of the six birds nesting, 2/3rd are flying somewhere else. I need to calculate how many that is. Let me write that down.

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * number of birds nesting.

So, substituting the number of birds nesting, which is 6:

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * 6.

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6666..., but multiplied by 6. So, 2/3 of 6 is equal to 4. Because 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 2 times 2 is 4. So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Okay, so far, we have 6 birds nesting and 4 birds flying overhead. So, that's 6 + 4 = 10 birds accounted for so far.

Now, the next part says, "3 groups of eight birds each feeding." So, that means there are 3 groups, and each group has 8 birds. So, I need to calculate the total number of birds in these groups.

Number of birds feeding = 3 groups * 8 birds per group.

So, that's 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

So, now, adding that to the previous total, we have 10 + 24 = 34 birds in total.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 6 nesting, 4 flying, 24 feeding. 6 + 4 is 10, plus 24 is 34. That seems right.

But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says, "Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding." So, the first part is 6, the second is 2/3 of 6, which is 4, and the third is 3 groups of 8, which is 24. So, 6 + 4 +24 is 34.

Wait, but hold on, is the 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting, or is it 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead? Let me check the wording again.

"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding."

So, it's 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting, which is 6. So, 2/3 of 6 is 4. So, that's correct.

So, 6 nesting, 4 flying, 24 feeding. 6 + 4 is 10, plus 24 is 34.

Wait, but hold on, is the 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting, or is it 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead? Let me read it again.

"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding."

So, the first part is six birds nesting, the second part is 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, that is 2/3 of 6, which is 4. So, that's correct.

So, 6 + 4 + 24 is 34. So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting, or is it 2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead? Because sometimes these problems can be tricky.

But the way it's phrased is: "2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead." So, "that number" refers to the number of birds nesting, which is 6. So, 2/3 of 6 is 4. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it had said "2/3rd of the number of birds flying overhead," that would be different, but it's not. It
