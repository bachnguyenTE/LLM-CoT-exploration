Q: At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Allan's house with corn and cannoli. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannoli. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house." Hmm, so initially, there are 40 cannolis. And the corn is twice that. So, if I let the number of cannolis be C, then the corn would be 2C. 

Wait, but it says he has a total of 40 cannolis. So, does that mean the initial number is 40, or is that the total after he bought more? Let me read again: "He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house." Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. It could mean that the total number of cannolis is 40, or that he has 40 cannolis in his house. Maybe it's the latter. So, initially, there are 40 cannolis. Then, he bought more. 

So, let me parse the problem again: "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannoli. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannoli at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannoli." Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannoli Allan has in the house?

Wait, so initially, there are 40 cannolis. Then, he bought more. So, the initial 40 is before he bought more, and then he bought 60 more cannoli and 40 fewer corns. So, the total number of corns and cannoli would be the initial plus the additional.

Let me try to structure this.

Let me denote:

Let C_initial be the initial number of cannoli. So, C_initial = 40.

Then, the number of corns initially is twice that, so C_initial = 2 * C_initial? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "twice as much corn as cannoli." So, corn is twice the number of cannoli. So, if there are C initial cannoli, then corn is 2C.

But wait, the problem says he has a total of 40 cannoli in his house. So, is that the initial 40, or is that the total after he bought more? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannoli. He has a total of 40 cannoli in his house." Hmm, so maybe the total number of cannoli is 40. So, that would mean that the initial number is 40, and then he bought more. So, the initial number is 40, and then he bought 60 more. So, total cannoli is 40 + 60 = 100. Similarly, corn is twice the number of cannoli, so 2 * 100 = 200. So, total corn and cannoli would be 100 + 200 = 300. But wait, let me check.

Wait, the problem says: "He has a total of 40 cannoli in his house." So, that could mean that the total number of cannoli is 40, so initial is 40, and then he bought 60 more, so total is 100. Then, corn is twice the number of cannoli, so 200. So, total corn and cannoli is 100 + 200 = 300? Wait, but the problem says "the combined total of the number of corns and cannoli Allan has in the house?" So, maybe the initial 40 is part of the total? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannoli. He has a total of 40 cannoli in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannoli at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannoli. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannoli Allan has in the house?"

So, the initial number of cannoli is 40. Then, he bought 60 more, so total is 40 + 60=100. Corn is twice the number of cannoli, so 2*100=200. So, total corn and cannoli is 100 +200=300. So, 330? But wait
