A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of each type of ball in the store.

There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for each color of balls by multiplying the number of balls by their respective prices.

For red balls: 3 balls × $9 = $27.

For blue balls: 11 balls × $5 = $55.

For green balls: 25 balls × $3 = $75.

Finally, I'll add up the costs of all the balls to find the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold.

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for each color of balls:**

   - **Red Balls:**
     \[
     3 \text{ balls} \times \$9 \text{ per ball} = \$27
     \]
   
   - **Blue Balls:**
     \[
     11 \text{ balls} \times \$5 \text{ per ball} = \$55
     \]
   
   - **Green Balls:**
     \[
     25 \text{ balls} \times \$3 \text{ per ball} = \$75
     \]

2. **Add up the costs of all the balls:**
   \[
   \$27 \text{ (Red)} + \$55 \text{ (Blue)} + \$75 \text{ (Green)} = \$157
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{157}
   \]
