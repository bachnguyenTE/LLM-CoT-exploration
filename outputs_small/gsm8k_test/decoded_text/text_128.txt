Q: Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dillon buying some fruits from the store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges. The prices are given in terms of each other. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon. So, if I let the cost of a pepper be a variable, say 'p', then a watermelon would be 3p, and an orange would be 3p minus 5. That makes sense.

Now, Dillon is going to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The question is asking for the total amount of money he will spend. They also mention that each pepper costs 15$. Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing. If each pepper costs 15$, then the cost of a watermelon would be 3 times that, which is 15$ times 3, so 45$. And the orange would be 5 less than a watermelon, so 45$ minus 5$ is 40$. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but okay, let's go with that.

So, let me write down the given information:

- Cost of a pepper, p = 15$.
- Cost of a watermelon, w = 3p.
- Cost of an orange, o = w - 5.

So, substituting p = 15$ into the equations:

w = 3 * 15 = 45$.

o = 45 - 5 = 40$.

Alright, so now I know the cost of each fruit. Now, let's figure out how much Dillon is going to spend.

He is buying:

- 4 watermelons.
- 20 peppers.
- 10 oranges.

So, I need to calculate the total cost for each type of fruit and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the watermelons.

Each watermelon is 45$, so 4 watermelons would be 4 * 45.

Let me compute that: 4 * 45. Hmm, 4*40 is 160, and 4*5 is 20, so 160 + 20 = 180$. So, 4 watermelons cost 180$.

Next, the peppers. Each pepper is 15$, and he's buying 20 of them. So, 20 * 15.

Calculating that: 20 * 15. 20*10 is 200, and 20*15 is 0, so 200 + 0 = 200$. So, 20 peppers cost 200$.

Now, the oranges. Each orange is 40$, and he's buying 10 of them. So, 10 * 40.

Calculating that: 10*40 is straightforward, that's 400$. So, 10 oranges cost 400$.

Now, to find the total amount Dillon is going to spend, I need to add up the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges.

So, total cost = cost of watermelons + cost of peppers + cost of oranges.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = 180 + 200 + 400.

Let me add them step by step.

First, 180 + 200. 180 + 200 is 380, and then add the remaining 0, so 380.

Then, 380 + 400. Hmm, 380 + 400 is 780, and then add the remaining 0, so 780.

So, the total amount Dillon will spend is 780$.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180. Wait, hold on, 4*45 is 180, but 4*45 is 180. That's correct.

Peppers: 20 * 15 = 300. Wait, hold on, 20*15 is 300? Wait, 15*20 is 300. Yes, that's correct.

Oranges: 10 * 40 = 440? Wait, 10*40 is 440
