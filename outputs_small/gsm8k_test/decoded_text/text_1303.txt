Q: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Nate's dog digging holes and him filling them up. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. 

Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while he's on vacation. When he gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. The question is, how many weeks does it take him to fill all the holes?

Alright, so let's break this down. 

First, the dog digs for 14 days. Each day, it digs 6 holes. So, I think I need to calculate the total number of holes the dog digs during those 14 days. That should be straightforward: 6 holes/day multiplied by 14 days. Let me write that down.

Total dog holes = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Okay, so the dog digs 84 holes during his vacation. Now, when he gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day. But here's the catch: every night, the dog keeps digging 6 holes. So, does that mean that each day, the net gain of holes is 9 (filled) minus 6 (dug) per day? Or is it that the dog digs 6 holes each night, and then he starts filling 9 holes the next day? Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says, "the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night." So, does that mean that each night, the dog digs 6 holes, and then when he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a day? So, each day, the net gain is 9 (filled) minus 6 (dug) = 3 holes per day. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The dog digs 6 holes each day, and when he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a day. So, during the day, the dog is digging 6 holes, and during the night, he's filling 9 holes. So, each full day-night cycle, the net gain is 9 - 6 = 3 holes. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, no. Because the dog is digging 6 holes each day, and then when he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a day. So, the filling starts the next day. So, perhaps the net gain is 9 holes per day minus 6 holes per night, but only during the days when he's filling. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should model this as two separate phases: the days when the dog is digging, and the days when he's filling. But actually, the dog is digging every day, and when he gets home, he starts filling. So, perhaps the total number of holes is the sum of the holes dug during the vacation days plus the holes filled after he gets home.

Wait, let me think. So, during the 14 days of vacation, the dog digs 6 holes each day, so that's 84 holes. Then, once he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a day, but every night, the dog digs 6 holes. So, does that mean that each day, after he fills 9 holes, the dog digs 6 holes overnight, and then the next day, he fills 9 again?

So, each full cycle (filling and digging) takes a day, and during that day, he fills 9 holes, but then the dog digs 6 holes overnight. So, the net gain per cycle is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

Wait, but if he starts filling the holes after the dog has already dug 6 holes each night, then each day, he fills 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 holes the next night. So, the net gain is 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the dog digs 6 holes each day, and when he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, each day, the total number of holes is 6 (dug during the day) plus 6 (dug overnight) = 12 holes, but then he fills 9 holes during the day. So, the net gain is 9 - 12 = -3 holes per day. That doesn't make sense because the dog would be losing holes.

Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps the dog digs 6 holes each day, and when he gets home, he starts filling 9 holes a
