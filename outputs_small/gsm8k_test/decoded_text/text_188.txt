Q: A trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a trader buying bags of wheat, transporting them, and then selling them to make a profit. I need to figure out how many bags he sold. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the trader buys each bag of wheat for $20. That seems straightforward. So, if he buys 'n' bags, his total cost for the wheat would be 20n dollars. But wait, he also has to pay for the transportation cost. Each bag costs $2 to transport, so for 'n' bags, that would be 2n dollars. So, the total cost for the trader is the cost of the wheat plus the transportation cost. That makes sense.

So, total cost = (Cost per bag * number of bags) + (Transportation cost per bag * number of bags)
Total cost = 20n + 2n = 22n dollars.

Now, he sells each bag for $30. So, if he sells 'n' bags, his total revenue would be 30n dollars. But wait, the problem says he made a total profit of $400. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, profit = total revenue - total cost.

Given that profit is $400, we can set up the equation:

30n - 22n = 400

Let me compute that. 30n minus 22n is 11n. So, 11n = 400.

Wait, hold on, 30n minus 22n is 8n, right? Because 30 minus 22 is 8. So, 8n = 400.

Wait, 400? Or is that a typo? Let me check the problem again.

"A trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

Oh, okay, so the profit is $400. So, 8n = 400.

So, n = 400 / 8 = 50.

Wait, so he sold 50 bags? That seems low, but let me verify.

Wait, if he bought 'n' bags, sold them at 30 each, so revenue is 30n. His cost was 20n + 2n = 22n. So, profit is 30n - 22n = 8n. And that's equal to 400.

So, 8n = 400, so n = 50. So, he sold 50 bags.

Wait, but the problem says he bought some bags, transported them, sold all of them, and made a profit of $400. So, if he sold 50 bags, each at 30, that's 50*30=1500. His cost was 20*50 + 2*50=1000 +100=1100. So, profit is 1550 - 1100=450. Hmm, that's more than 400. So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

"A trader buys some bags of wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag. If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?"

Wait, so the profit is $400, but when I calculated, I got 50 bags, but that gave me a profit of $450. Hmm, so maybe I need to set up the equation correctly.

Wait, let me define variables properly. Let me let x be the number of bags he bought. So, he bought x bags at $20 each, so total cost is 20x. Then, he has to pay $2 per bag for transportation, so total transportation cost is 2x. So, total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

He sells all the bags at $30 each, so total revenue is 30x. Profit is revenue minus cost, so 30x - 22x = 8x. And the profit is given as $400, so 8x = 400.
