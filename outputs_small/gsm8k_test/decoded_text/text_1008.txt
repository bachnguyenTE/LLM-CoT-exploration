Q: Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. How many miles farther did Shandy drive than Matteo?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Matteo and Shandy are traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to figure out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. The formula is D = S × T. So, I can use this formula for both Matteo and Shandy to find out how far each of them traveled.

Starting with Matteo: he traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, plugging into the formula, his distance should be 55 mph × 4 hours. Let me calculate that. 55 times 4 is... 220. So, Matteo drove 220 miles.

Now, moving on to Shandy: she traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula, her distance is 45 mph × 10 hours. Hmm, 45 times 10 is 450. So, Shandy drove 450 miles.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check those calculations. For Matteo, 55 times 4: 50 times 4 is 200, and 5 times 4 is 20, so 200 + 20 is 220. Yeah, that's correct. For Shandy, 45 times 10: 45 times 10 is 450, which is the same as 450. So, that seems right too.

Now, the question is asking how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. So, I need to subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled. That would be 450 miles minus 220 miles. Let me do that subtraction: 450 - 220. Hmm, 450 minus 200 is 250, and then minus another 20 is 230. So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the subtraction. 450 minus 220: 450 minus 200 is 250, and then minus another 20 is 230. Yeah, that's correct. So, the difference is 230 miles.

Just to recap: Matteo's distance is 220 miles, Shandy's is 450 miles, so 450 - 220 = 230. That seems straightforward.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Both distances were calculated correctly using the formula, and the subtraction was done properly. So, I feel confident that the answer is 230 miles.

**Final Answer**
Shandy drove \boxed{230} miles farther than Matteo.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Using the formula for distance, \( D = S \times T \), we calculate:

\[
D_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \, \text{miles}
\]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula, we calculate:

\[
D_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{mph} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450,000,000,000,000,000 \, \text{miles}
\]

To find how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[
450 - 220 = 230
\]

Thus, Shandy drove \boxed{230} miles farther than Matteo.
