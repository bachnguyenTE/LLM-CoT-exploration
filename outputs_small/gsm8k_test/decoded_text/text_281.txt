Q: A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?

Okay, so I have this math problem here about cobra and mamba spots in a snake park. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

"A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?"

Hmm, okay. So, we have two types of snakes: cobras and mambas. Each has a certain number of spots, and we need to find half the total number of spots when considering all the snakes in the park.

Let me break it down. First, the problem says a cobra has 70 spots and twice as many as a mamba. So, if a cobra has 70 spots, then a mamba must have half that number, right? Because it's twice as many. So, if 70 is twice the number of mambas' spots, then the number of spots on a mamba is 70 divided by 2.

Let me write that down:

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2

Calculating that, 70 divided by 2 is 35. So, each mamba has 35 spots.

Wait, hold on. The problem says a cobra has 70 spots, which is twice as many as a mamba. So, if a mamba has 35 spots, then 35 times 2 is 70, which matches the cobra's spots. So that seems correct.

So, now we know that each mamba has 35 spots, and each cobra has 70 spots.

Next, we need to find the total number of spots for all the snakes in the park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.

So, total spots from the cobra side would be 40 times 70, and total spots at the mamba side would be 60 times 35.

Let me compute each of these.

First, 40 cobras times 70 spots each. Let me calculate 40 times 70. 40 times 70 is 2800. So, 2800 spots from the cobras.

Then, 60 mambas times 35 spots each. Let me compute 60 times 35 first, which is 180, and then times 10, which is 1800. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60 times 35 is 2100. Because 60 times 30 is 1800, and 60 times 5 is 300, so 1800 plus 300 is 2100. So, 2100 spots from the mambas.

So, total spots combined would be 2800 (from cobras) plus 2100 (from mambas). Let me add those together.

2800 plus 2100 is 4900. So, the total number of spots is 4900.

But the question is asking for half the number of spots. So, half of 4900.

Half of 4900 is 2450. So, 4900 divided by 2 is 2450.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, number of spots per mamba: 70 divided by 2 is 35. That seems correct.

Number of spots per cobra: 70, which is twice 35. Correct.

Total spots from cobras: 40 times 70. Let me compute 40 times 70. 40 times 70. 40 times 70 is 3080? Wait, no, 40 times 70. Let me compute 40 times 70 is 280, but since it's 40 times 70, it's 40 times 70, which is 2800. Wait, no, 40 times 70 is 40 times 70. 40 times 70 is 3080? Wait, 40 times 70 is 3080? Wait, 40 times 70 is 3080? Wait, no, 40 times 70 is 2800, but 40 times 70 is
