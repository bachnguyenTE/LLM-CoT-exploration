Q: Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not too confident about age problems, but I'll give it a shot.

First, let me parse the problem. It says Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, right now, Jerry's age is equal to twice his age 5 years back. And then, we need to find out how old he'll be in 3 years. Alright, so we need to find Jerry's current age and then add 3 to it.

Let me assign a variable to Jerry's current age. Let's say Jerry is currently x years old. That seems like a good start. So, x = current age.

Now, the problem says he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was x - 5 years old. Because if he's x now, subtract 5, that's 5 years ago.

So, according to the problem, his current age is twice that. So, x = 2*(x - 5). That makes sense. So, the equation is x = 2*(x - 5). Let me write that down:

x = 2*(x - 5)

Okay, now I need to solve for x. Let's do that step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation. 2*(x - 5) is 2x - 10. So, the equation becomes:

x = 2x - 10

Hmm, now I need to get all the x terms on one side. Let me subtract 2x from both sides to get:

x - 2x = -10

Which simplifies to:

- x = -10

So, if I multiply both sides by -1, I get:

x = 10

Wait, so Jerry is currently 10 years old? Let me check that.

If Jerry is 10 now, then 5 years ago he was 5. And 10 is twice 5? Yes, that works. So, 10 is the correct current age.

Now, the question is, how old will Jerry be in 3 years? So, if he's 10 now, in 3 years he'll be 10 + 3 = 13. So, 13 years old.

Wait, that seems a bit young, but maybe that's correct. Let me double-check.

Wait, if he's 10 now, 5 years ago he was 5. 10 is twice 5, so that's correct. In 3 years, 10 + 3 is 13. Hmm, yeah, that seems right.

But wait, 13 seems a bit young for someone to be 10. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Let me go back. The problem says, "Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago." So, if he's x now, 5 years ago he was x -5. So, x = 2*(x -5). That seems correct.

Wait, but if x is 10, then 10 = 2*(10 -5) = 2*5 =10. So, that's correct. So, 10 is the current age, and in 3 years, 13. Hmm, maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?"

So, the problem is about his current age and his age in the future. So, if he's 10 now, in 3 years he'll be 13. That seems correct.

Wait, but 13 seems a bit young for someone to be 10. Maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe the problem is in a different time frame or something.

Wait, no, the problem is straightforward. It's about current age and future age. So, if he's 10 now, in 3 years he'll be 13. So, 13 is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should represent it with another variable to see if I get the same result.

Let me let Jerry's current age be y. So, y = 2*(y -5). So, same equation.

So, y = 2y -10

Subtract y from both sides: 0 = y -10

So, y =10. So, same result. So, current age is 10, in 3
