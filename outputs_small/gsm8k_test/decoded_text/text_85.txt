Okay, so I need to figure out how many quilt blocks Gene has. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. Each shirt is its own quilt block. Every row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. Now he's 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, Gene has one shirt from each vacation he's been on. Each shirt is a separate quilt block. So, the number of blocks he has is equal to the number of different vacations he's had.

He goes on four vacations a year. He started vacationing when he was 23 and is now 34. So, how many years has he been vacationing?

Let me calculate that. If he started at 23 and is now 34, that's 34 - 23 = 11 years. Wait, 34 minus 23 is 11? Let me check that again. 23 + 11 = 34, yes, that's correct. So he's been on vacation for 11 years.

But wait, does that mean he's had 11 different years of vacation? Or is it 11 years of vacationing? Hmm, the wording says he has been vacationing since he was 23, and now he's 34. So, the number of years he's been on vacation is 34 - 23 = 11 years. So, he's had 11 different years of vacation.

But each year, he goes on four vacations. So, each year, he has four different blocks. So, the total number of blocks would be the number of years he's been on vacation multiplied by the number of vacations per year.

So, 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 blocks.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says he has one shirt from each vacation he's been on. So, each year, he has four different blocks. So, if he's been on vacation for 11 years, each with four blocks, that would be 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

But let me think again. Is the number of years he's been on vacation 11, or is it 11 years of vacationing? Because if he started at 23 and is now 34, that's 11 years. So, he's had 11 different years of vacation.

But each year, he goes on four vacations, each of which is a different block. So, each year, he has four blocks. So, over 11 years, he has 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

Wait, but another way to think about it is, each year, he has four different blocks, so each year adds four blocks to his collection. So, if he's been on vacation for 11 years, he's added 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

Alternatively, if he's had 11 different years, each with four blocks, that's 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

Wait, but is the number of years he's been on vacation 11 or 11? Because 34 - 23 is 11, so 11 years. So, 11 years of vacationing, each with four blocks, so 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

But hold on, another interpretation: Maybe he's been on vacation for 11 years, each time going on four different vacations, so each year, he adds four blocks. So, 11 years * 4 blocks/year = 44 blocks.

Alternatively, if he's been on vacation for 11 years, each with four blocks, that's 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

Wait, but 34 - 23 is 11, so 11 years. So, 11 * 4 = 44 blocks.

But let me think about the wording again: "He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old." So, he's been on vacation for 11 years, each time going on four different blocks. So, 11 * 4 = 44.

Alternatively, if he's been on vacation for 11 years, each time going on four different blocks, so 11 * 4 = 44.

Wait, but 34 - 23 is 11, so 11 years. So, 1
