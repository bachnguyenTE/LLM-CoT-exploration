Q: Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Nathan's bouncy ball. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Nathan drops it from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. I need to find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce.

Hmm, okay. So, starting height is 24 feet, right? Because each story is 24 feet, and it's on the third floor. So, the first time it's dropped from 24 feet. Then, after the first bounce, it goes to 2/3 of that height, and then after the second bounce, it goes to 2/3 of the first bounce height. So, I need to calculate the second bounce height.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. 

Starting height (H₀) = 24 feet.

After the first bounce, the height (H₁) = (2/3) * H₀.

After the second bounce, the height (H₂) = (2/3) * H₁.

So, substituting the values, H₁ = (2/3) * 24. Let me compute that.

24 divided by 3 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 2 is 16. So, H₁ is 16 feet.

Then, H₂ = (2/3) * H₁ = (2/3) * 16. Let me calculate that.

16 divided by 3 is approximately 5.333..., and 5.333... multiplied by 2 is 10.666... So, H₂ is 10 and 2/3 feet.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

First, H₀ is 24. H₁ is 2/3 of 24, which is indeed 16. Then, H₂ is 2/3 of 16, which is 10.6666... So, yes, that seems correct.

But let me think about the units. Each story is 24 feet, so the starting height is 24 feet, which is one story. Then, each bounce is 2/3 of the previous height. So, after the first bounce, it's 16 feet, which is 16/24 = 2/3, so that makes sense.

Wait, 16 is 2/3 of 24? No, 16 is 2/3 of 24. Wait, 24 times 2/3 is 16. So, that's correct.

Then, 16 times 2/3 is 10.666..., which is 10 and 2/3 feet. So, that's the height after the second bounce.

But let me think about whether the question is asking for the height after the second bounce or something else. It says, "how high does the ball go on its second bounce?" So, yes, that's H₂, which is 10 and 2/3 feet.

Alternatively, maybe I should express it as an improper fraction or a decimal. 10 and 2/3 is equal to 32/3, which is approximately 10.6666... So, depending on what's preferred, but since the problem didn't specify, either should be fine, but maybe the fraction is better.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 2/3 of 16 is (2/3)*16. 16 divided by 3 is 5 and 1/3, times 2 is 10 and 2/3. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, 2/3 of 16 is 12/3, which is 4, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24, so 16 is 2/3 of 24,
