Q: Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?

Okay, so Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She wants to divide these into 3 rows, and in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Then, she uses the remaining cups for cinnamon tea, which totals 15 cups. The question is asking how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, she has 27 cups. She divides them into 3 rows. So, if I divide 27 by 3, that should give me the number of cups in each row. Let me do that: 27 divided by 3 is 9. So, each row has 9 cups.

Now, in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. That means in each row, the number of chamomile cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. So, if each row has 9 cups, and half of them are chamomile and half are mint, that would mean each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea. But wait, you can't have half a cup of tea. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is saying that in each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. So, perhaps the number of cups in each row is split equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, if each row has 9 cups, then 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. But again, that's a fraction, which doesn't make sense in the context of cups. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Let me read it again: "She divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups." So, in each row, the number of chamomile cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. So, if each row has 9 cups, then the number of chamomile cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. So, 9 divided by 2 is 4.5. But that's not a whole number, which is confusing because you can't have half a cup.

Wait, maybe the problem is implying that the number of cups in each row is split equally between chamomile and mint tea, but the total number of cups in each row is 9. So, if each row has 9 cups, and half of them are chamomile and half are mint, then each row has 4.5 cups of each. But that's still a fraction. Maybe the problem is expecting an answer in fractions or decimals?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that she uses the remaining cups for cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups. So, the total number of cups is 27, and she uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea. So, the remaining cups are 27 minus 15, which is 12 cups. So, 12 cups are divided into 3 rows, with each row having equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups.

Wait, that might make more sense. Let me try that approach.

So, total cups: 27.

Cinnamon tea cups: 15.

So, remaining cups: 27 - 15 = 12.

These 12 cups are divided into 3 rows, with each row having equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups.

So, each row has 12 divided by 3, which is 4 cups.

So, each row has 4 cups, and in each row, the number of chamomile cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. So, 4 divided by 2 is 2.

Therefore, each row has 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea.

So, the answer is 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

Wait, that seems to make sense. Let me verify.

Total cups: 27.

Cinnamon tea: 15.

So, remaining cups: 12.

Divided into 3 rows: 12 / 3 = 4 cups per row.

In each row, equal number of chamomile and mint: 4 / 2 = 2.

So, 2 cups of mint tea per row.

Yes, that seems correct.

I think I initially misinterpreted the problem, thinking that each row had 9 cups, but actually, the remaining cups are 12, which are divided into 3 rows, each with 4 cups, and each row has 2 cups of each type.

So, the answer is 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

**Final Answer**
The number of cups of mint tea in each row
