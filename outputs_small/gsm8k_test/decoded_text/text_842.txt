Q: While on vacation in Bali, Thea bought a hat from a craftsman worth $70. If she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, how much change did she get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She provided four $20 bills, which amounts to 4 multiplied by $20, totaling $80.

Next, subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given. The hat costs $70, so subtract $70 from $80.

Finally, calculate the change Thea received by subtracting the cost of the hat from the total amount given.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave:**
   
   Thea gave four $20 bills.
   
   \[
   4 \times \$20 = \$80
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the hat:**
   
   The hat costs \$70.

3. **Find the change Thea received:**
   
   Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given.
   
   \[
   \$80 - \$70 = \$10
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$10}
\]
