Q: Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.  There are 3 sleeves in a box.  If 9 kids want 2 smores apiece and 6 adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will they need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Graham crackers and how many boxes they need for a group of kids and adults. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says each sleeve of Graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. There are 3 sleeves in a box. So, I think that means each box has 3 sleeves, and each sleeve can make 8 smores. So, maybe I need to calculate how many smores are needed in total and then see how many boxes are required.

Alright, let's break it down. There are 9 kids who each want 2 smores. So, for the kids, that would be 9 kids multiplied by 2 smores each. Let me write that down: 9 * 2 = 18 smores. 

Then, there are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore each. So, that's 6 * 1 = 6 smores. 

Now, to find the total number of smores needed, I should add the smores needed for the kids and the adults together. So, 18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores in total. 

Okay, so we need 24 smores. Now, each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, how many sleeves do we need? I think I can divide the total smores by the number of smores per sleeve. So, 24 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: 24 / 8 = 3. 

So, that means we need 3 sleeves. But wait, each box has 3 sleeves. So, if we need 3 sleeves, how many boxes do we need? Hmm, 3 sleeves per box, so 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, we need 1 box. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Each box has 3 sleeves, each sleeve makes 8 smores. So, 3 sleeves * 8 smores per sleeve = 24 smores per box. So, yeah, one box gives us exactly 24 smores, which is exactly what we need. 

So, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores. So, each box has 3 sleeves, each making 8 smores, so 24 smores per box. 

Total smores needed: 9 kids * 2 = 18, plus 6 adults *1 =6, so 18 +6=24? Wait, hold on, 18 +6 is 24? Wait, 9*2 is 18, 6*1 is 6, 18+6 is 24. So, 24 smores total. 

So, 24 smores divided by 8 smores per sleeve is 3 sleeves. 3 sleeves per box, so 1 box. 

Wait, but 3 sleeves per box, each sleeve is 8 smores, so 3*8=24. So, 24 smores per box. So, 24 smores needed, so 1 box is enough. 

I think that's correct. So, the answer is 1 box. 

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If each box can make 24 smores, and we need 24 smores, then 1 box is sufficient. So, yeah, 1 box is enough. 

Alternatively, if I think about how many smores each child and adult needs, but that might complicate things. But let's see: 9 kids *2=18, 6 adults *1=6, total 24. So, 24. Each box gives 24, so 1 box. 

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 1 box.

**Final Answer**
The number of boxes needed is \boxed{1}.

First, we calculate the number of smores needed for the kids and adults. Each child wants 2 smores, and there are 9 kids:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we calculate the number of smores needed for the adults. Each adult eats 1 smore, and there are 6 adults:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding the smores needed for the kids and adults together gives:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
