Okay, so Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip. There's a 30% off sale, and he wants to buy a shirt and a pair of shorts. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35. I need to figure out how much money he'll have left after the purchase, including sales tax. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35. So, adding those together: 25 + 35. Let me do that math. 25 plus 35 is 60. Wait, no, that's 60? No, 25 plus 35 is actually 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60?

Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60? Wait, no, 25 plus 35 is 60?
