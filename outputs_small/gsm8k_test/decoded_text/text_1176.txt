Q: A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Okay, so I have this problem about a teacher who uses chalk for his students. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the teacher has a 5-inch piece of chalk. He likes to conserve chalk, so he usually uses 20% of it each day. But on Monday, he used more than usual because his students needed extra help, so he used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Then, he goes back to using only 20% each day. The question is, how many days does he have before he has to recycle that piece?

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. 

On Monday, he started with a new piece, which is 5 inches. But he used more than usual, which was 45% of the chalk. Wait, but he usually uses 20%, so 45% is more than usual. So, he used 45% of the chalk on Monday. 

Let me calculate how much chalk he used on Monday. 45% of 5 inches is... 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, he used 2.25 inches of chalk on Monday. 

But wait, he started with a new piece, which is 5 inches. So, he used 2.25 inches, which means he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left at the end of Monday. 

But then, he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day. So, starting from Monday, he uses 20% each day. But he has 2.75 inches left. So, how many days can he use 20% of the chalk before he needs to recycle the original 5-inch piece?

Wait, hold on. The problem says he has a 5-inch piece of chalk. So, he starts with a new piece each day, right? Or does he have a single 5-inch piece? Hmm, the problem says "a teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk." So, I think he has a single 5-inch piece, and each day he uses some portion of it, and when it's smaller than 2 inches, he recycles it.

But on Monday, he used more than usual, so he used 45% of the chalk, which is 2.25 inches, leaving him with 2.75 inches. Then, he goes back to using only 20% each day. So, starting from Monday, he uses 20% each day, but he has 2.75 inches left. So, how many days can he use 20% of the chalk before he needs to recycle the original 5-inch piece?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Is the 5-inch piece a single piece, or does he have multiple pieces? The problem says "a teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk," so I think it's a single 5-inch piece. So, each day, he uses a portion of it, and when it's smaller than 2 inches, he recycles it.

But on Monday, he used more than usual, so he used 45% of the chalk, which is 2.25 inches, leaving him with 2.75 inches. Then, he goes back to using only 20% each day. So, starting from Monday, he uses 20% each day, but he has 2.75 inches left. So, how many days can he use 20% of the chalk before he needs to recycle the original 5-inch piece?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the amount of chalk he has at the end of each day. On Monday, he starts with 5 inches. He uses 45% of it, so he uses 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches. So, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left. Then, he goes back to using 20% each day. So, each day after Monday, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk.

But wait, does he use 20% of the original 5-inch piece each day, or 20% of the remaining chalk? The problem says he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day. So, I think it's 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

So, starting from Monday, he has 2.75 inches left. Then, each subsequent day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk, and when the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches, he has to recycle the original 5-inch
