Q: Helena is a mad scientist testing her latest creation, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena’s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?

Okay, so I have this problem about Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum. It says that the serum makes a drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will the person grow if they drink it? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. The serum affects the growth of arms and legs. It adds an arm every three days and a leg every five days. So, over time, the person will accumulate more arms and legs. The question is asking how many new limbs this will cause after fifteen days.

Alright, so I think I need to calculate how many arms are added in fifteen days and how many legs are added in the same period. Then, I can add those two numbers together to get the total number of new limbs.

Let me break it down. For arms: every three days, one arm is added. So, how many times does three go into fifteen? Let me do the division: 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, that means the person will get an arm added five times in fifteen days. So, 5 arms.

Similarly, for legs: every five days, one leg is added. So, how many times does five go into fifteen? That's 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So, the person will get a leg added three times in fifteen days. So, 3 legs.

Now, adding the arms and legs together: 5 arms + 3 legs = 8 new limbs.

Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, every three days, an arm is added. So, on day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18... Wait, hold on, 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5. So, on day 15, both an arm and a leg would be added.

But does that mean that on day 15, both happen? So, does that mean that on day 15, the person gets both an arm and a leg? So, that would be two new limbs on day 15.

But wait, the question is about after fifteen days. So, does that include day 15? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "after fifteen days," which could mean the total time elapsed, so including day 15. Or it could mean the number of new limbs after the first fifteen days, which would exclude day 15.

Wait, let me read the question again: "After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena’s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?" So, it's after fifteen days, so I think it's including day 15. So, on day 15, both an arm and a leg are added. So, that would be two new limbs on day 15.

But wait, if I just calculate the number of times arms are added in fifteen days, that's 5, and legs are added 3 times, so 5 arms and 3 legs, totaling 8. But on day 15, both happen, so that would be two new limbs on day 15, but the arms and legs are already counted in the 5 and 3.

Wait, no, because the arms are added every three days, so on day 15, which is a multiple of 3, so yes, an arm is added. Similarly, on day 15, which is a multiple of 5, a leg is added. So, in total, on day 15, both happen, so that's two new limbs.

But wait, if I just count the number of arms and legs separately, I get 5 arms and 3 legs, which is 8. But on day 15, a leg is added, and on day 12, an arm is added, and on day 15, both happen. So, maybe the total number of arms is 5, legs is 3, but on day 15, a leg is added, and on day 12, an arm is added, and on day 15, both.

So, perhaps the total number of arms is 5, legs is 3, but on day 15, a leg is added, and on day 12, an arm is added, and on day 15, 12, 15, both happen. So, maybe the total number of arms is 5, legs is 3, but on day 15, a leg is added, and on day 12, an arm is added, and on day 15, 12, 15, both happen.

Wait, maybe I need to think
