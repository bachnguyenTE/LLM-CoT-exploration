Q: John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John doing several activities while on vacation. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I take it slowly, I think I can figure it out.

First, the problem says John spends 6 hours boating. Then, he spends half that time swimming. Hmm, so if boating is 6 hours, swimming would be half of that, right? Let me write that down.

Boating time = 6 hours
Swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, he spent 6 hours boating and 3 hours swimming. Got that part.

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. So, to find the total time he spent watching shows, I need to multiply the number of shows by the duration of each show.

Number of shows = 3
Duration per show = 2 hours
Total watching time = 3 * 2 = 6 hours

Alright, so he spent 6 hours watching shows. The problem also mentions that this total time of 6 hours watching shows was 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Wait, 30%? Let me check that. It says "30% of the time he spent." Hmm, so 30% of his total time was spent on these activities. So, the 6 hours watching shows is 30% of his total time.

Let me denote his total time as T. So, 30% of T is equal to 6 hours. In equation form, that would be:

0.30 * T = 6

To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.30.

T = 6 / 0.30

Let me compute that. 6 divided by 0.30. Hmm, 0.30 goes into 6 how many times? Well, 0.30 times 20 is 6, because 0.30 * 20 = 6. So, T = 20 hours.

So, John spent a total of 20 hours on all his activities.

Now, the problem says he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time he spent sightseeing is 40% of the total time T, which is 20 hours.

Let me write that down:

Sightseeing time = 40% of T = 0.40 * T

We already found T is 20 hours, so:

Sightseeing time = 0.40 * 20 = 8 hours

Wait, so he spent 8 hours sightseeing? Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Boating: 6 hours
Swimming: 3 hours
Shows: 6 hours
Total activities: 6 + 3 +6 =15 hours

But wait, the problem says that the 6 hours watching shows was 30% of his total time. So, if total time is 20 hours, then 30% of 20 is 6, which matches. So, that part checks out.

Then, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, which is 8 hours. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me go through the problem again.

He spends 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming, and 6 hours watching shows. That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. But wait, 15 hours is 30% of his total time. So, 30% of T is 15 hours. So, T = 15 / 0.30 = 15 / 0.30 = 16.666... hours? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got T as 20 hours.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

"He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. This was 30% of the time he spent. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. How much time did he spend sightseeing?"

Wait, so the 6 hours boating and 3 hours swimming, plus 6 hours watching shows, is 30% of his total time. So, 6 + 3 +6 =15 hours is 30% of his total time. So, 15 hours is 30% of T, so T = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours? Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation.
