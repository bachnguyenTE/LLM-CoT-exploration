Q: Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. Melanie’s mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?

Okay, so Melanie wants to make a toothpick sculpture and needs 200 toothpicks. She's saving them for her sandwiches, and her mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches every week. So far, she's saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Now, she wants to know how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks needed for the sculpture.

First, let me figure out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 each week for 12 weeks. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 10 by 12. Let me write that down:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks saved.

Okay, so she has 120 toothpicks saved. The total she needs is 200 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

200 total - 120 saved = 80 toothpicks needed.

Now, she's saving 10 toothpicks each week, same as her mom. So, to find out how many more weeks she needs to save, I can divide the remaining toothpicks by her weekly savings rate.

80 toothpicks needed / 10 toothpick/week = 8 weeks.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If she saves 10 each week, then in 8 weeks, she'll save 10*8=80 toothpicks. Adding that to her current 120, she'll have 120+80=200 toothpicks, which is exactly what she needs. So, that makes sense.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Sometimes, when dealing with multiplication and division, it's easy to slip up.

So, 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks: 10*12=20, so 10*12=10, 10*12=20. Wait, no, that's not right. 10*12 is 20, but 10*12 weeks is 20 toothpicks. Wait, no, 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks is 10*1=10, for 2 weeks is 20, so for 12 weeks, it's 20 toothpicks. So, 10*12=20. So, 10*12=20 toothpicks saved in 2 weeks. So, 10*12=120 toothpicks saved in 12 weeks. That seems correct.

Then, 200 total -110 saved=80 toothpicks needed. 80 divided by 10 is 8 weeks. So, 8 weeks is the correct answer.

Wait, but hold on, the question says she started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, does that mean she has 12 weeks saved, or is it 12 weeks? Wait, no, 12 weeks is 12 weeks, so 10*12=120. So, that's correct.

So, 200-120=80. 80/10=8. So, 8 weeks. So, the answer is 8 weeks.

But let me think again. Is there any possibility that the 10 toothpicks per week is per sandwich, and she's saving them for lunch? So, maybe she's saving them for lunch, so maybe she's not saving them for her own use? But the question says she's saving them for her own use, so it's 10 per week. So, the rate is consistent.

So, the total needed is 200, she has 120, so she needs 80 more. At 10 per week, 8 weeks. So, 8 weeks is the answer.

Wait, but the question says she started saving toothpicks and has saved 10 each week for the past 12 weeks. So, is that 12 weeks or 12 weeks saved? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. It says, "she started saving toothpicks and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks." So, she has saved 10 each week for 12 weeks, so 120 toothpicks. So, that's correct.

So, 200-120=80. 80/1
