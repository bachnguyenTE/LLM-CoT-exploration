Q: 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?

Okay, so I have this problem here about customers being kicked out of a store for different behaviors. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. That seems straightforward. So, let me note that down. Let me assign a variable to the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Let's say the number of shoplifters is S. 

Then, it says that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Hmm, so that means the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of people kicked out for refusing masks minus 5. Since we already know that 3 people were kicked out for refusing masks, let me plug that in. 

So, S = 4*(number of people for masks) - 5. Wait, no, actually, the number of shoplifters is 4 times the number of people who refused masks minus 5. So, if 3 people refused masks, then S = 4*3 - 5. Let me compute that. 4*3 is 12, minus 5 is 7. So, S, the number of shoplifters, is 7. 

Okay, so 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting. Now, the problem says that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, if S is 7, then the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3*S. Let me calculate that. 3*7 is 21. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 

Wait, hold on, 21? That seems a bit high because 3 times 7 is 21, but the total number of people kicked out is 50. Let me check my calculations again. 

Number of people for masks: 3. Number of shoplifters: 4*3 -5 = 12 -5 =7. Number of physical violence: 3*7=21. So, total so far is 3 +7 +21=31. But the total is supposed to be 50. So, 50 -31=19. So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons. 

Wait, but 19 seems a bit low. Let me see if I interpreted the problem correctly. 

The problem says: "A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting." So, the number of shoplifters is 4*(number of people for masks) -5. So, if 3 people refused masks, then S=4*3 -5=12-5=7. So, that's correct. 

Then, "three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale." So, that's 3*S=3*7=21. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence. 

So, total so far: 3 (refusing masks) +7 (shoplifters) +21 (physical violence)=31. So, 50 total, so 50-31=19. So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons. 

Wait, but 19 seems low. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?"

So, the number of shoplifters is 4*(number of people for masks) -5. So, if 3 people refused masks, then S=4*3 -5=12-5=7. So, 7 shoplifters. Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, 3*7=21. So, 21 people. So, 3+7+21=31. 50-31=19. So, 19. Hmm.

Wait, but 19 is the number of people for other reasons. But 19 seems low. Let me think if I interpreted the problem correctly. Maybe the number of shoplifters is 4 times the number of people for masks minus 5. So, 4*3=12, minus 5=7. So, 7 shoplifters. Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
