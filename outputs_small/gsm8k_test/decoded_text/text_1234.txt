Q: Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number is 3/4 of the number she wrote this year. So, I need to find out how many novels she wrote this year. 

Alright, so if 9 is 3/4 of this year's total, I can set up an equation. Let me denote the number of novels she wrote this year as x. So, according to the problem, 3/4 of x is equal to 9. In equation form, that would be:

(3/4) * x = 9

Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. That way, I can isolate x on one side. Let me write that out:

x = 9 * (4/3)

Hmm, let me compute that. 9 multiplied by 4 is 36, and then divided by 3 is 12. So, x equals 12. That means she wrote 12 novels this year.

Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If she wrote 12 novels this year, then 3/4 of 12 should be 9. Let me calculate 3/4 of 12. 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 3 times 3 is 9. Yep, that matches the given information. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of fractions. If 9 is 3/4 of the total, then the total should be 9 divided by 3/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 9 divided by 3/4 is 9 multiplied by 4/3. 9 times 4 is 36, and 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, same result.

Another way to approach it is to think about what fraction 9 is of the total. Since 9 is 3/4, the total should be 9 divided by 3/4, which is 12. So, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 9 divided by 3/4 is 12? Wait, no, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12? Wait, no, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12? Wait, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12? Wait, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12. Wait, maybe I confused the numbers.

Wait, 3/4 of 12 is 9. So, 12 is the total. So, 9 is 3/4 of 12. So, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should visualize it. If 3/4 of something is 9, then the whole thing is 9 divided by 3/4, which is 12. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as proportions. If 3/4 corresponds to 9, then 1 corresponds to x. So, 3/4 is to 9 as 1 is to x. So, setting up the proportion:

3/4 / 9 = 1 / x

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, cross-multiplying:

3/4 * x = 9

So, x = 9 * 4/3 = 12. Yeah, that's the same as before.

Wait, another way: 3/4 is 0.75 in decimal. So, 0.75 times what is 9? So, 9 divided by 0.75 is 12. Because 0.75 times 12 is 9. Let me check: 0.75 times 10 is 7.5, 0.75 times 2 is 1.5, so 7.5 + 1.5 is 9. So, yes, that works.

So, all these different methods are leading me to the same answer, which is 12. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think about it in terms of units. If 3/4 of her novels this year is 9, then each unit is 9 divided by 3, which
