Q: On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Peter's exercise routine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that on Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he did 16 minutes. The question is asking how many minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to find out how much time Peter has already spent exercising on Sunday and Monday. Then, I can figure out what twice that combined time is, and subtract that from the total he wants to exercise on Tuesday. Wait, no, actually, the problem says he wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. So, that means his target for Tuesday is twice the sum of Monday and Sunday's exercise times. So, I need to calculate Monday plus Sunday, then multiply that by two, and then see how much more he needs to do on Tuesday to reach that target.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. So, on Sunday, he did 23 minutes. On Monday, he did 16 minutes. So, the combined time for Sunday and Monday is 23 plus 16. Let me add those together. 23 plus 16 is... 29 minutes. Wait, is that right? 23 plus 10 is 33, plus 6 is 39. Oh, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 23 plus 16. Let me do it again. 23 + 16. 3 plus 6 is 9, and 2 plus 1 is 3, so 39. Yeah, that's correct. So, Sunday and Monday combined is 39 minutes.

Now, Peter wants to exercise twice that amount on Tuesday. So, twice 39 minutes. Let me calculate that. 39 times 2. 30 times 2 is 60, and 9 times 2 is 18, so 60 plus 18 is 78. So, Peter wants to exercise 78 minutes on Tuesday.

But wait, hold on. Is that the total he wants to exercise on Tuesday, or is it the target? Let me read the question again. It says, "On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined." So, that means his target is twice the combined time of Monday and Sunday. So, yes, that would be 2 times 39, which is 78 minutes.

But wait, hold on again. Is that the total he wants to exercise on Tuesday, or is it the amount he needs to add to his current total? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined." So, that's twice the combined time. So, if he did 39 minutes on Sunday and Monday, he wants to do twice that on Tuesday. So, 2 times 39 is 78 minutes. So, he needs to exercise 78 minutes on Tuesday.

But wait, hold on, is that the total he wants to exercise on Tuesday, or is it the amount he needs to add to his current total? Let me think. If he wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, that would mean that his total exercise time on Tuesday is twice that. So, if he did 39 minutes on Monday and Sunday, he wants to do 2 times 39, which is 78 minutes on Tuesday. So, he needs to add 78 minutes to his current total.

But wait, hold on, is that the case? Or is he just planning to do twice the amount of time on Tuesday compared to the combined time of Monday and Sunday? So, if he did 39 minutes on Monday and Sunday, he wants to do twice that on Tuesday, so 78 minutes. So, he needs to add 78 minutes to his current total.

Wait, but the question is asking, "How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?" So, if he wants to reach his goal, which is twice the combined time, then he needs to exercise 78 minutes on Tuesday. So, the answer is 78 minutes.

But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Sometimes, these problems can be tricky. Let me try to parse the sentence again: "On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined." So, the key here is that "twice the amount of time he did on Monday
