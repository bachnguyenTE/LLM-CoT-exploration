Q: Amalia, Megan, and Dior divided the home chores so that each person had something to do while the others were working. Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.

Okay, so I have this problem where Amalia, Megan, and Dior are dividing the home chores. Each person has a specific task: Amalia mows the lawn, Megan walks the dog, and Dior does laundry. I need to figure out the total time they all took to do their chores altogether. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what each person does and how long it takes them. 

Amalia is responsible for mowing the lawn, and it takes her 4 hours. That's straightforward. So, Amalia's time is 4 hours.

Next, Megan has to walk the dog. The problem says this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan must have taken 4 hours plus 2 hours. Let me write that down: Megan's time is 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Now, Dior is doing laundry, and it took her over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Wait, "over 4 hours" is a bit vague. Does that mean more than 4 hours, or exactly 4 hours plus some extra? The problem says "over 4 hours longer," so I think it means more than 4 hours. But it doesn't specify by how much. Hmm, maybe I need to interpret it differently. Let me read the problem again.

"Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn." So, "well over 4 hours" is a bit ambiguous. Does that mean more than 4 hours, or more than 4 hours in total? Wait, the time Amalia took was 4 hours, so Dior took over 4 hours longer than that. So, if Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took 4 + something more than 4 hours. But the problem doesn't specify how much more. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that "well over 4 hours" is just more than 4, so maybe 5 hours? Or is it 4 plus some variable?

Wait, the problem says "over 4 hours longer," so maybe it's 4 + t, where t is more than 0. But without a specific number, I might need to represent it as a variable. But the problem is asking for the total time they all took to do their chores altogether. So, maybe I can express Dior's time as 4 + t, where t > 0, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I need to assume that Dior took exactly 5 hours? Or maybe it's 4 + 4 = 8 hours? Wait, no, that would be exactly 4 hours longer, which is not "over." Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn." So, Amalia took 4 hours, so Dior took more than 4 hours longer than that. So, Dior's time is 4 + t, where t > 0. But since the problem doesn't specify how much longer, maybe I need to represent it as 4 + t, but since the problem is asking for a total time, maybe I can just add 4 + t, but without knowing t, I can't compute a numerical value. Hmm, that seems problematic.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: "Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn." So, Amalia took 4 hours, so Dior took more than 4 hours longer than that. So, Dior's time is 4 + t, where t > 0. But since the problem is asking for the total time, maybe I can just add 4 + (4 + t) = 8 + t, but without knowing t, I can't get a numerical answer. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that Dior took exactly 4 hours longer, which
