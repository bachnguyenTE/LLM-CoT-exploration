Okay, so Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed, and he needs two pieces of fabric. Each piece has to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. The bed itself measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. I need to figure out how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the problem. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. So, if Jim is making two pieces of fabric, each piece needs to be larger than the bed. Specifically, each piece should be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. That means for each piece, the length will be the original length plus 2 feet, and the width will be the original width plus 2 feet.

Let me write that down:

Original bed dimensions:
- Length: 6 feet
- Width: 8 feet

Each fabric piece needs to be:
- Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
- Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Wait, hold on, 8 feet plus 2 feet is 10 feet? That seems a bit wide, but okay, maybe it's correct. Let me double-check. 8 + 2 is indeed 10. So each piece is 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

Now, since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, I need to calculate the area of one piece and then multiply it by two. The area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width.

So, area of one piece:
- Length: 8 feet
- Width: 10 feet (Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 11 feet, but 8 + 2 is 10, not 11. So, 8 + 2 is 10, not 11. So, 8 feet by 10 feet. So, 8 * 10 is 80 square feet. Wait, 8 * 10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, no, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 80? Wait, 8*10 is 88, so 8*10 is 80. Yeah, that's correct.

So, each piece is 80 square feet. Since he needs two pieces, I need to multiply 80 by 2.

So, 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the dimensions. The original bed is 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider. So, 6 + 2 is 8, and 8 + 2 is 10. So, each piece is 8 by 10, which is 80. Two pieces would be 160. That seems right.

But let me think again. Is the question asking for the total fabric needed? So, two pieces, each 8x10, so 80 each, so 160 total. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says, "two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed." So, each piece is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the bed is 6x8, so each piece is (6+2)x(8+2) = 8x10, which is 80 each. So, two pieces would be 160. So, 160 square feet.

Wait, but hold on, is the question asking for the total fabric needed? Or is it asking for the fabric for the bed? Wait, no, the question says, "Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy
