Okay, so I need to figure out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Walter collects money for charity. He starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell his friends and family about his neighbors and the online fund, but his friend gives him $200 as well. So, I need to find out how much the lawyer is going to contribute.

Hmm, let me parse this. So, Walter has two sources of donations: his neighbors and the online fund. His lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, does that mean the lawyer's contribution is three times the total of all other donations? Or is it three times each individual's donation?

Wait, the problem says, "Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates." Hmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that the lawyer's donation is three times the total of all other donations, or it could mean three times each individual's donation. But in the context, it's probably referring to the total donations from everyone else, so the lawyer's contribution is three times that total.

So, let's see. First, Walter collects $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from the online fund. His friend gives him $200. So, the total donations from everyone else (neighbors and online fund) are $500 + $1500 = $2000. Then, the lawyer is going to donate three times that amount. So, 3 * $2000 = $6000.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says, "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well." So, does that mean that the friend is giving $200, which is part of the total? So, the total from everyone else is $500 + $1500 + $200 = $2200. Then, the lawyer is donating three times that, so 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me read the problem again.

"Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?"

So, the key points are:

1. Walter collects $500 from neighbors.

2. Then, he collects $1500 from the online fund.

3. His lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.

4. Walter is going to tell his friends and family about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well.

So, the "everyone else" refers to the donations from his neighbors and the online fund, right? Because the lawyer is offering to donate three times as much as everyone else. So, the total from everyone else is $500 + $1500 = $2000. Then, the lawyer is donating three times that, so 3 * $2000 = $6000.

But wait, the problem says, "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well." So, does that mean that the friend is giving $200, which is part of the total? So, the total from everyone else is $500 + $1500 + $200 = $2200. Then, the lawyer is donating three times that, so 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Wait, so which is it? Is the friend giving $200 as part of the total, or is that separate?

Let me read the problem again: "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well." So, the friend is giving $200, which is part of the total. So, the total from everyone else is $500 + $1500 + $200 = $2200. Then, the lawyer is donating three times that, so 3 * $2200 = $6600.

But wait, the problem
