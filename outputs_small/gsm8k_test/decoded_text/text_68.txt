Q: There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Dr. Wertz's school, and I need to figure out how many teachers there are. Let me read it again: "There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?" Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, the number of boys should be double that. Let me write that down. If G is the number of girls, then B, the number of boys, is 2G. So, substituting the number of girls, B = 2 * 60. Let me calculate that: 2 times 60 is 126. So, there are 126 boys at the school.

Now, the problem also mentions that there are 5 students per teacher. So, I need to find out how many teachers there are based on the total number of students. To do that, I should first find the total number of students in the school. That would be the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls.

So, total students = number of boys + number of girls. Plugging in the numbers, that's 126 + 60. Let me add those together. 126 plus 60 is 186. So, there are 186 students in total.

Now, since there are 5 students per teacher, I can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. So, number of teachers = total students / students per teacher. That would be 186 divided by 5.

Let me do that division. 186 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 18 three times (because 5*3=15), subtract 15 from 18, you get 3. Bring down the 6, making it 36. 5 goes into 36 seven times (5*7=35), subtract 35 from 36, you get 1. So, 186 divided by 5 is 37.2. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have a fraction of a teacher. So, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me double-check my calculations. Number of girls is 60, so boys are twice that, which is 126. Total students: 126 + 60. 126 + 60 is indeed 186. Then, 186 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 times 37 is 185, so 186 is 1 more than 185, so it's 37 with a remainder of 1. So, 37.2 teachers? That doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a teacher. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?" Hmm, so maybe the 5 students per teacher is a rate, not the number of students per teacher. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. It says "5 students to every teacher," which usually means 5 students per teacher. So, 5 students per teacher.

But then, 186 divided by 5 is 37.2, which is 37 teachers and 1 student left over. But that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a teacher. So, maybe the problem is expecting an integer number of teachers, so perhaps we need to round up? But in real life, you can't have a fraction of a teacher, so maybe the answer is 38 teachers, but that would mean 190 students, which is more than the total number of students. Wait, that can't be right either.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of boys. Let me check that again. If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, then boys are 2*60=126. That seems correct. So, total students are 126+60=186. 186 divided by 5 is 37.2, which is 37 teachers and 1 student left. But since you can't have a fraction of a teacher, maybe the answer is 37 teachers, but that would mean 190 students, which is way more than
