Q: A large bag of Starbursts candy has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.  If this bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies and half as many yellow candies as red candies, how many candies are pink?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Starbursts candies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there's a bag with 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. That's the total number, right? So, I know that the total is 232. Now, it mentions different colors: red, orange, yellow, and pink. I need to find out how many are pink.

Let me break down the information given:

- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies.
- We need to find the number of pink candies.

Alright, so let's start by writing down what we know.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: twice the number of red candies
3. Yellow candies: half the number of red candies
4. Total candies: 232

So, first, I can calculate the number of orange and yellow candies based on the red ones.

Starting with orange candies: twice the number of red candies. Since red is 54, twice that would be 54 * 2. Let me compute that.

54 * 2 = 108. So, there are 108 orange candies.

Next, yellow candies: half the number of red candies. Red is 54, so half of that is 54 / 2. Let me calculate that.

54 / 2 = 27. So, there are 27 yellow candies.

Now, let me add up all the candies we know: red, orange, and yellow. That should give me the total number of these three colors.

Red: 54
Orange: 108
Yellow: 27

Adding them together: 54 + 108 +27.

Let me do that step by step.

54 + 108: 54 + 108. 54 + 100 is 154, and 108 is 108, so 154 + 108. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 54 + 108 is actually 162? Wait, 54 + 100 is 154, plus 8 is 162. Hmm, okay, so 54 + 108 is 162.

Then, adding the yellow candies: 162 + 27.

162 + 20 is 182, plus 7 is 189. So, total candies of red, orange, and yellow are 189.

Wait, but the total number of candies in the bag is 232. So, if 189 are red, orange, and yellow, then the remaining must be pink.

So, to find the number of pink candies, I subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow from the total number of candies.

Total candies: 232
Red, orange, yellow: 189
So, 232 - 189 = ?

Let me compute that.

232 minus 189. Hmm, 232 is less than 189? Wait, no, 232 is more than 189. Wait, 232 - 189.

Let me do it step by step.

Starting from the units place: 2 - 9. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place.

So, 2 becomes 12, and the tens place becomes 3 -1 (since we borrowed 1 from the tens place). So, 12 - 9 = 3.

Now, the tens place: 1 (after borrowing) - 8. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the hundreds place.

So, 2 becomes 1, and the tens place becomes 11 - 8 = 3.

Now, the hundreds place: 1 (after borrowing) - 1 = 0.

So, putting it together, 232 - 189 = 43.

Wait, that seems off. Let me check.

Wait, 189 + 43 = 232? Let me add 189 + 43.

189 + 40 is 193, plus 3 is 196. Wait, that's not 232. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my subtraction.

Wait, maybe I did the subtraction wrong. Let me try again.
