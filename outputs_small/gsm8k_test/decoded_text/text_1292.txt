Q: Jackie grew 3" over the summer.  She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert.  If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jackie, Anne, and Albert's heights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. She is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. And Albert is 36 inches tall. I need to find out how tall Jackie was before the summer.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's note down all the information given:

1. Albert is 36 inches tall.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.

So, starting from the top, Albert is 36 inches. Anne is twice that size. So, Anne's height is 2 times 36 inches. Let me write that down:

Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height = 2 * 36 inches.

Calculating that, 2 times 36 is 72. So, Anne is 72 inches tall.

Now, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is Anne's height minus 2 inches.

Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2 inches = 72 inches - 2 inches = 70 inches.

Wait, hold on. If she grew 3 inches over the summer, that means her current height is 3 inches more than her height before summer. So, to find her height before summer, I need to subtract those 3 inches from her current height.

So, Jackie's height before summer = 70 inches - 3 inches = 73 inches.

Wait, that seems a bit tall for a person, but maybe it's okay. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Albert is 36 inches. That's given.
2. Anne is twice that, so 2 * 36 = 72 inches. That makes sense.
3. Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so 72 - 2 = 70 inches. That seems right.
4. She grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before summer was 70 - 3 = 77 inches.

Hmm, 73 inches is 6 feet 1 inch, which is quite tall. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

"Jackie grew 3" over the summer. She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?"

Wait, so Albert is 36 inches. Anne is twice that, so 72 inches. Then, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so 70 inches. Then, she grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before summer was 70 - 3 = 67 inches.

Wait, 67 inches is 5 feet 7 inches, which is still quite tall, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check the units. All the units are in inches, so that's consistent. Albert is 36 inches, which is 3 feet. Anne is twice that, so 72 inches, which is 6 feet. Then, 2 inches shorter than Anne is 70 inches, which is 5 feet 10 inches. Then, she grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before summer was 70 - 3 = 67 inches, which is 5 feet 7 inches.

Wait, 67 inches is 5 feet 7 inches, which is 5'7". That's quite tall, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check the problem again: "She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert." So, Anne is twice the size of Albert, so 2*36=72. Then, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so 72-2=70. Then, she grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before summer was 70-3=67 inches.

Wait, 67 inches is 5 feet 7 inches. Hmm, that seems correct. Maybe the problem is expecting that answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me see: "She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert." So, is the "2" inches referring to the difference in height between Anne and Jackie, or is it something else?

Wait, the problem says: "She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert." So, the "2"
