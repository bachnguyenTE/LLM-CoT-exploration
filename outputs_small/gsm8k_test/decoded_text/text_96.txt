Q: Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept two-thirds of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, I can calculate James's sleep duration by multiplying 9 by 2/3.

Next, I'll find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept by subtracting James's sleep time from Harry's sleep time.

Finally, I'll present the result to show how many more hours Harry slept than James.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine how many hours James slept:**
   
   James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the hours Harry slept.
   
   \[
   \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James:**
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
