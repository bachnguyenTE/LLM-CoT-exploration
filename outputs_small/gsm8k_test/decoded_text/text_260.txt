Q: Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Carla is making cookies today and tomorrow, and I need to figure out how many cups of flour she'll need. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. A dozen is 12 cookies, right? So, for every 12 cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour. That makes sense.

Now, Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. I need to find out how much flour she needs in total for both days. Hmm, okay. So, maybe I should figure out how much flour is needed for each day separately and then add them together.

Let me start with today. She's making 36 cookies. Since a dozen is 12, I can figure out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. To do that, I can divide 36 by 12. Let me write that down:

36 ÷ 12 = ?

Hmm, 12 times 3 is 36, so that means 36 cookies are 3 dozen. So, 36 cookies equal 3 dozen. Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, then 3 dozen would require 3 times 2 cups. Let me calculate that:

3 × 2 = 6

So, Carla needs 6 cups of flour today.

Okay, now moving on tomorrow. She's making 30 cookies. Again, I need to figure out how many dozens that is. So, 30 divided by 12. Let me do that division:

30 ÷ 12 = ?

Hmm, 12 times 2 is 24, and 12 times 3 is 36. So, 30 is between 2 and 3 dozens. Let me see, 12 × 2 = 24, so 30 - 24 = 6. So, 30 cookies are 2 dozen and 6 cookies, which is 2.5 dozen. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the fraction. 30 divided by 12 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 6. So, 30 ÷6 is 5, and 12 ÷6 is 2. So, 5/2, which is 2.5. Yeah, that's correct. So, 30 cookies are 2.5 dozen.

Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, then 2.5 dozen would require 2.5 times 2 cups. Let me compute that:

2.5 × 2 = 5

So, Carla needs 5 cups of flour tomorrow.

Now, to find the total amount of flour Carla needs, I just add the flour needed for today and tomorrow together. So, 6 cups for today plus 5 cups for tomorrow.

6 + 5 = 11

Therefore, Carla needs 11 cups of flour in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do division, I might get confused.

Starting with today: 36 cookies. 36 divided by 12 is 3. So, 3 dozen. 3 times 2 cups is 6 cups. That seems right.

Tomorrow: 30 cookies. 30 divided by 12 is 2.5. 2.5 times 2 is 5 cups. That also seems correct.

Adding them together: 6 + 5 is 11. So, 11 cup total. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but let me think. 36 cookies is 3 dozen, which is 6 cups, and 30 cookies is 2.5 dozen, which is 5 cups. So, 6 + 5 is 11. Yeah, that adds up.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in another way. If 12 cookies need 2 cups, then 1 cookie needs 2/12 cups, which simplifies to 1/6 cups per cookie. So, for 36 cookies, it would be 36 × (1/6) cups. Let me compute that:

36 × (1/6) = 6 cups. Yep, same as before.

For 30 cookies, it would be 30 × (1/6) = 5 cups. So, again, 6 + 5 = 11. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can use ratios or proportions. If 12 cookies require 2 cups, then 36 cookies require x cups. So, setting up a proportion:

12 cookies / 2 cups
