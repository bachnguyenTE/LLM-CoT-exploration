Q: Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether Jackie should do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, if Jackie does her taxes herself, she can only do 3 fewer hours of freelance work. Each hour of freelance work she gives up means she loses $35/hour in income. So, I need to calculate how much money she loses from not doing the taxes herself.

If she does the taxes, she can only work 3 hours less. So, the loss in income would be 3 hours multiplied by $35 per hour. Let me write that down:

Loss in income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $15

So, by doing her taxes herself, she loses $15 in income.

Now, the accountant charges $90 per hour. I need to figure out how much she would earn if she hires the accountant. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many hours she needs to do freelance work. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume she needs a certain number of hours, or perhaps the question is asking for the difference in earnings based on the loss from taxes.

Wait, let me read the question again:

"If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?"

So, it seems like the accountant is charging $90 per hour, but the loss is $35 per hour. So, the net gain or loss per hour would be the accountant's rate minus the lost income.

Wait, no. If she does taxes, she can only do 3 fewer hours, but the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, maybe the question is asking how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, considering the loss from taxes.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the difference in earnings between hiring the accountant and doing taxes herself.

But without knowing how many hours she needs to do freelance work, I can't calculate the exact amount. Maybe the question is assuming she needs a certain number of hours, but it's not specified here.

Wait, let me check the problem again:

"If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?"

Hmm, so maybe the question is assuming that she needs to do a certain number of hours, but it's not given. Maybe the question is expecting a general formula or something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the difference in earnings between hiring the accountant and doing taxes herself, considering the loss from taxes.

So, if she does taxes, she can only do 3 fewer hours, but the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, the net gain would be the difference between the accountant's rate and the lost income.

Wait, let me think. If she does taxes, she can only do 3 fewer hours, but the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, the total loss from taxes is 3 hours * $35/hour = $15. The accountant is charging $90 per hour, so the net gain per hour would be $90 - $35 = $55 per hour.

But wait, if she does taxes, she can only do 3 fewer hours, so the total loss is $15, but the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, the net gain would be $90 - $35 = $55 per hour, but she can only work 3 hours less. So, the total net gain would be 3 hours * $55/hour = $165.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify.

If she does taxes, she can only work 3 fewer hours, but the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, for each hour she would have done, she would have lost $35, but the accountant is making $90. So, the net gain per hour is $90 - $35 = $55. But since she can only work 3 hours less, the total net gain is 3 * $55 = $165.

Wait, but that seems like a significant amount. Let me see if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, considering the loss from taxes. So, the total loss is $15, and the accountant is charging $90 per hour. So, if she hires the accountant, she can make $90 per hour, but she can only work 3 hours less. So, the net gain is
