Q: Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday. How many hours will all Peyton’s after-work activities take?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours all of Peyton's after-work activities take. Let me break this down step by step because it seems like a series of different activities with varying durations. 

First, the problem says she scheduled a one-hour yoga class on Monday. That's straightforward. So, Monday's yoga is 1 hour.

Next, it mentions a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga. Hmm, so if Monday's yoga is 1 hour, then the cooking class should be 3 times that. Let me write that down: Cooking class = 3 * Monday's yoga time. So, 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours. Got it, so the cooking class is 3 hours long.

Then, there's a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday. Half an hour is 0.5 hours. So, Wednesday's event is 0.5 hours.

Moving on to Thursday, there's a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday. Wait, hold on, that's a bit confusing. It says the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday. But wait, the cooking class is already on Wednesday. So, does that mean the cooking class on Thursday is the same as Wednesday? Or is it a different cooking class?

Wait, let me read that again: "a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday." Hmm, so the cooking class on Thursday is a different event? Or is it the same as Wednesday? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.

It says: "a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday." So, the cooking class on Thursday is a separate event, and the museum tour is half as long as that. So, if the cooking class on Thursday is, say, X hours, then the museum tour is X/2 hours.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the duration of the cooking class on Thursday. It only mentions the cooking class on Wednesday is 3 hours. So, is the cooking class on Thursday the same as Wednesday's? Or is it a different one?

Wait, the problem says: "a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday." Wait, hold on, let me check the original problem again.

Wait, the original problem says: "Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one-hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday."

Wait, hold on, I think I misread that. Let me parse it again.

It says: "Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one-hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday."

Wait, so the cooking class is on Tuesday? Because it says "Monday’s yoga on Tuesday." That seems a bit confusing. So, is the cooking class on Tuesday, which is three times as long as Monday's yoga on Tuesday? Wait, that can't be, because Monday's yoga is on Monday, and Tuesday's cooking class is on Tuesday.

Wait, maybe it's a typo or something. Let me try to parse it again.

Wait, the problem is: "Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one-hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday."

Wait, so the cooking class is on Tuesday, which is three times as long as Monday's yoga on Tuesday. But that would mean both the cooking class and Monday's yoga are on Tuesday, which doesn't make sense because they are different days. So, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe it's a translation issue or a typo. Maybe it's supposed to say "Monday’s yoga on Monday" instead of "Monday’s yoga on Tuesday." Because otherwise, it's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the cooking class is on Tuesday, which is three times as long as Monday's yoga on Tuesday. But that would mean both are on Tuesday, which is impossible. So, perhaps the original problem is mistyped.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say "Monday’s yoga on Monday" and "Tuesday’s cooking class." So, the cooking class is on Tuesday, which is three times as long as Monday's yoga on Tuesday. But that would mean both
