Q: Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?

Okay, so Louise is an artist who needs to apply a coat of varnish to her paintings. She usually takes 7 minutes for one painting, but today she's using a new varnish that takes 12 minutes to dry. The question is asking how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to using the old varnish.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how long it takes to varnish 6 paintings with the old varnish and then how long it takes with the new varnish. Then, I can find the difference between these two times to see how much longer it will take with the new varnish.

So, for the old varnish, each painting takes 7 minutes. If she has 6 paintings, the total time should be 6 multiplied by 7 minutes. Let me write that down:

Total time with old varnish = 6 paintings * 7 minutes/painting = 42 minutes.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the new varnish, each painting takes 12 minutes. So, using the same number of paintings, 6, the total time should be 6 multiplied by 12 minutes. Let me calculate that:

Total time with new varnish = 6 paintings * 12 minutes/painting = 72 minutes.

Wait, so with the old varnish, it takes 42 minutes, and with the new varnish, it takes 72 minutes. To find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish, I need to subtract the two times.

Difference in time = Total time with new varnish - Total time with old varnish = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer with the new varnish. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

6 times 7 is indeed 42, and 6 times 12 is 72. Subtracting 42 from 72 gives 30. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is straightforward: calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with each varnish and find the difference. So, the answer should be 30 minutes longer.

**Final Answer**
The coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take \boxed{30} minutes longer.

Louise needs to apply a coat of varnish to her paintings. She usually takes 7 minutes per painting, but with the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes per painting. We need to find the difference in drying time for 6 paintings.

First, calculate the total drying time with the old varnish:
\[
6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, calculate the total drying time with the new varnish:
\[
6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

Find the difference in drying time:
\[
72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

The coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take \boxed{30} minutes longer.
