Q: Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Poppy is trying to solve a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Hmm, that's a lot! Let me see how to figure out how many pieces are left after she and her mom have placed some. 

First, Poppy starts by placing a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter is like 25%, right? So, if there are 1000 pieces in total, a quarter of that would be... let me calculate that. 

1000 divided by 4. Hmm, 1000 divided by 4 is 250. So, Poppy placed 250 pieces. That seems straightforward. 

Now, after Poppy placed her part, there are still some pieces left. The question says her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. Okay, so I need to figure out how many pieces are left after Poppy's part and then calculate a third of that number. 

So, after Poppy placed 250 pieces, the remaining number of pieces is 1000 minus 250. Let me do that subtraction. 

1000 minus 250. Hmm, 1000 minus 200 is 800, and then minus another 50 is 830. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 250 is 200 + 50. So, 1000 minus 200 is 798, and then minus 50 is 743. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should do it step by step.

1000 minus 200 is 800. Then, 800 minus 50 is 798. Wait, so 1000 minus 250 is 798? Hmm, that seems correct because 250 plus 798 is 1048, which is more than 1000. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 250 plus 798 is 1048? No, that's not right. Wait, 250 plus 700 is 950, plus 98 is 1048. Wait, that's way more than 1000. So, I must have messed up my subtraction.

Wait, 1000 minus 250 is 750, right? Because 250 is a quarter of 1000, so the remaining is three quarters, which is 750. So, 1000 minus 250 is 750. So, my initial subtraction was wrong. I think I added 200 and 50 instead of 250. So, 1000 minus 250 is 750. Got it.

So, after Poppy placed her 250 pieces, there are 750 pieces left. Now, her mom comes along and places a third of the remaining pieces. So, I need to find a third of 750. 

A third of 750 is calculated by dividing 750 by 3. Let me do that. 750 divided by 3. 3 goes into 7 two times with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 5 to make 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. Bring down the 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, that's 250. Wait, so a third of 750 is 250? That seems high because 750 divided by 3 is 250. So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

Wait, but hold on, if Poppy placed 250 and her mom placed 250, then the total placed is 250 plus 255, which is 505. So, 505 pieces are placed, and 1000 minus 505 is 495. So, 495 pieces are left. Hmm, but let me make sure I did that correctly.

Wait, so 1000 minus 250 is 750. Then, a third of 750 is 250. So, 250 pieces are placed by her mom. So, 250 plus 250 is 505. So, 1000 minus 555 is 495. So, 495 pieces are left. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me double-check
