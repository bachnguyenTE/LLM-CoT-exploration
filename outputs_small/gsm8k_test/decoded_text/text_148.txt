Okay, so I have this problem here about Brittany and her mom going to the museum. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. She received $8 in change. The question is, how much money did she give the cashier?

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. The total cost for one adult ticket and one child ticket would be the sum of the adult ticket and the child ticket. That should be $12 plus $10. Let me calculate that: 12 + 10 is 22. So, the total cost is $22.

Now, the mom gave the cashier some money, and she got $8 in change. That means the amount she gave minus the total cost equals $8. So, if I let x be the amount she gave, then x minus 22 equals 8. So, x - 22 = 8. To find x, I can add 22 to both sides of the equation. That gives me x = 8 + 22, which is 30. So, she gave the cashier $30.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the adult ticket is $12 and the child ticket is $10, then together that's $22. If she gave $30, then subtracting the $22 would give her $8 in change, which matches the problem statement. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, I think the answer is $30. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. The total cost is 12 + 10 = 22. She gave x dollars, and got back 8 dollars. So, x - 22 =8, so x=30. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It's pretty straightforward once you break it down. So, I'm confident that the amount she gave the cashier is $30.

**Final Answer**
The amount Brittany gave the cashier is \boxed{30} dollars.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. The total cost for these tickets is calculated as follows:

\[
12 + 10 = 22
\]

The change received is $8. Let \( x \) be the amount of money given to the cashier. The equation to find \( x \) is:

\[
x - 22 = 8
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 8 + 22 = 30
\]

Thus, the amount Brittany gave the cashier is \boxed{30} dollars.
