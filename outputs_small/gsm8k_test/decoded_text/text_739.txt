Q: Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Okay, so I have this problem here where Cecelia went to the milk store and bought some jars. The problem says that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. It also tells me that a gallon jar costs $5. I need to find out how much she spent in total on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the cost of a half-gallon jar. The problem says that a gallon jar is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So if I let the cost of a half-gallon jar be, say, x dollars, then the cost of a gallon jar would be x + $2. But wait, it also says that a gallon jar costs $5. So I can set up an equation:

x + 2 = 5

To find x, I can subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 5 - 2
x = 3

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3. That makes sense because if a gallon is $5, which is $2 more than a half-gallon, then the half-gallon must be $3.

Now, the problem asks for the total amount she spent on buying 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. So I need to calculate the cost for each type of jar separately and then add them together.

Starting with the 10 gallon jars. Each gallon jar costs $5, so for 10 of them, the total cost would be:

10 * $5 = $50

Wait, hold on, 10 gallons? That seems like a lot. Let me double-check. The problem says 10 gallon jars, so yes, 10 times $5 is $50. Okay, that seems right.

Next, the half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon costs $3, and she bought 16 of them. So the total cost for the half-gallon jars is:

16 * $3 = $18

Wait, 16 half-gallons? That's 8 gallons because each half-gallon is half a gallon. So 16 half-gallons equal 8 gallons. Hmm, that's a lot too. But the problem says 16 half-gallons, so I guess we have to go with that.

Now, to find the total amount she spent, I need to add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:

$50 (for gallon jars) + $18 (for half-gallon jars) = $68

So, the total amount she spent is $68.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, gallon jars are $5 each, 10 of them would be 10*5=50. Half-gallon jars are $3 each, 16 of them would be 16*3=48. Then 50+48=58? Wait, no, 50+48 is 58? Wait, no, 50+48 is 58? Wait, no, 50+48 is 58? Wait, 50+48 is 103? Wait, no, hold on, 50+48 is 58? Wait, no, 50+48 is 98? Wait, no, 50+48 is 98? Wait, no, 50+48 is 58? Wait, 50+48 is 58? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, no, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 58? Wait, no, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 58? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 98? Wait, 50+48 is 58? Wait, 50+48
