Q: Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Maggie and Riza each have $60. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and Riza spent a third of hers. I need to figure out how much money they have left together. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's tackle Maggie's situation. She started with $60 and spent a quarter of it. A quarter is the same as 1/4, right? So, to find out how much she spent, I can calculate 1/4 of 60. Let me write that out: 1/4 * 60. Hmm, 60 divided by 4 is... let me see, 4 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 2, then bring down the 0 to make 20. 4 goes into 22 five times, which is 20, subtract that, and you have 2 again. So, 60 divided by 4 is 16.5? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 4 times 16 is 24, and 4 times 16 is 64, which is too much. Wait, maybe I should do it differently.

Wait, 60 divided by 4. 4 goes into 6 once, that's 4, subtract 4 from 6, you get 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times, which is 20, subtract that, you get 0. So, 60 divided by 4 is 16.5? Wait, that can't be right because 16.5 times 4 is 66, which is more than 60. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Wait, 4 times 15 is 60, right? So, 15 times 4 is 60. So, 60 divided by 4 is 15. Wait, that makes sense because 4 times 15 is 60. So, 15 is the correct amount. So, Maggie spent $15. So, how much does she have left? She started with $60, spent $15, so 60 minus 15 is 45. So, $45 left.

Okay, now onto Riza. She also started with $60, but she spent a third of her money. A third is 1/3, so I need to calculate 1/3 of 60. Let me write that down: 1/3 * 60. Hmm, 60 divided by 3 is 20. So, Riza spent $20. Therefore, how much does she have left? She started with $60, spent $20, so 60 minus 20 is 40. So, $40 left.

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, I need to add the remaining amounts from both. So, Maggie has $45 left, and Riza has $40 left. So, 45 plus 40 is... let me add that. 40 plus 40 is 80, and then plus 5 more is 85. So, together, they have $85 left.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For Maggie: 1/4 of 60 is 15, so 60 minus 15 is 45. That seems right. For Riza: 1/3 of 60 is 20, so 60 minus 20 is 40. That also seems correct. Then, adding 45 and 40 together: 45 plus 40 is 85. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the total amount of money they have left together is $85.

**Final Answer**
The two of them have \boxed{85} dollars left.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of $60. Calculating this, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie spent $15, leaving her with:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent a third of her money, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of $60. Calculating this, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza spent $2
