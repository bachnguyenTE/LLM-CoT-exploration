Q: Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day.  He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.  He gets paid $4 per car.  How much does he make in 2 weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many cars Josh can service in a week. He works 3 cars each day and is open 5 days a week (Monday to Saturday).

Next, I'll calculate his daily earnings by multiplying the number of cars by the payment per car: 3 cars × $4 = $12 per day.

Then, I'll find his weekly earnings by multiplying the daily earnings by the number of days he works: $12 × 5 days = $60 per week.

Finally, to find his earnings for 2 weeks, I'll multiply the weekly earnings by 2: $60 × 2 = $120.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of cars Josh services in a week:**
   
   - **Cars per day:** 3
   - **Days open per week:** 5 (Monday to Saturday)
   
   \[
   \text{Total cars per week} = 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. **Calculate his daily earnings:**
   
   - **Payment per car:** \$4
   
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = 15 \text{ cars} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{day}
   \]

3. **Find his earnings for 2 weeks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for 2 weeks} = \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
