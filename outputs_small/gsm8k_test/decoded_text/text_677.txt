Q: Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?

Okay, so Carol and Jennifer are sisters who collect signatures from celebrities. They've already been collecting for five weeks, and now they have 20 and 44 signatures respectively. They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they want to reach a total of 100 signatures between them by the end. The question is asking how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. So together, they've collected 20 + 44 = 66 signatures so far. They have three more weeks to reach a total of 100 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they need to collect is 100, and they've already collected 66. Therefore, the number of signatures they still need to collect is 100 - 66 = 34.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. 20 plus 44 is indeed 66. 100 minus 66 is 34. So, they need to collect 34 more signatures in total over the next three weeks.

But the question is asking how many signatures they need to collect each week, right? So, if they have three more weeks, and they need 34 more signatures, then I think we need to divide 34 by 3 to find out how many signatures they need to collect each week.

So, 34 divided by 3 is approximately 11.333... So, that's about 11 and 1/3 signatures per week. But since they can't collect a fraction of a signature, they would need to collect 12 signatures each week to reach 36, which would bring their total to 66 + 36 = 102, which is over the goal. Alternatively, if they collect 11 each week, that's 33, bringing their total to 66 + 33 = 99, which is still under the goal. So, they need to collect 12 each week for two of the weeks and 11 in the third week, but that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the total number of signatures they need to collect, not necessarily how many each week. Let me check the question again.

"How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?"

So, the total number of signatures needed is 100 - 66 = 34. So, they need to collect 34 more signatures in total over the next three weeks.

But wait, 34 divided by 3 is 11 and 1/3, so that's approximately 11.3333. So, they need to collect 12 signatures each week for two weeks and 11 in the third week, but that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the total number of signatures needed, which is 34. But that seems too low because 34 is the total needed, not 34.

Wait, no, 100 - 66 is 34. So, they need 34 more signatures. So, the answer is 34.

But let me think again. Carol has 20, Jennifer has 44. So, together, 66. They have three more weeks. So, 100 - 66 = 34. So, they need 34 more signatures. So, the answer is 34.

But the problem is presented in a way that seems to be expecting a specific number, so maybe 34 is the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. 20 + 44 is 66. 100 - 66 is 34. So, 34 is the number of signatures they need to collect in total over the next three weeks.

But the problem says "how many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?" So, it's 34.

But wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.
