Q: Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, and a gallon of water costs $0.15. How much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that Gary does laundry twice a week. Hmm, so how many times does he do laundry in a week? Well, twice. So, in one week, he does two loads. But wait, a week has 7 days, right? So, does that mean he does laundry 2 times a week? Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Wait, hold on, 20? Is that 20? Or is it 22? Hmm, the way it's written is "20 gallons." Maybe it's a typo or something. Let me think. If it's 20, that's 20 gallons. But 20 is a bit unusual. Maybe it's 20 gallons, which is 20 gallons. Or maybe it's 200? No, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's 20 gallons, which is 20 gallons. Hmm, I think it's more likely 20 gallons. So, 20 gallons per load. Yeah, that seems more reasonable.

So, each load is 20 gallons, which is 20 gallons. So, 20 gallons per load. So, each time he does laundry, he uses 20 gallons. Got it.

Now, how much does each gallon of water cost? The question says a gallon of water costs $0.15. So, $0.15 per gallon. That seems a bit expensive, but okay, maybe it's a school project or something. Anyway, moving on.

So, first, let's figure out how many times he does laundry in a year. He does it twice a week. So, how many weeks are in a year? 52 weeks. So, 52 weeks times 2 times a week. So, 52 times 2 is 104. So, he does laundry 104 times a year.

Wait, let me double-check that. 52 weeks in a year, times 2 times a week. So, 52 times 2 is 104. Yeah, that's correct. So, 104 loads of laundry in a year.

Each load uses 20 gallons. So, total water usage per year is 104 times 20 gallons. Let me calculate that. 104 times 20. Hmm, 100 times 20 is 2000, and 4 times 20 is 80, so total is 2000 + 80 = 2080 gallons. So, he uses 2080 gallons of water in a year.

Now, each gallon costs $0.15. So, total cost is 2080 gallons times $0.15 per gallon. Let me compute that. 2080 times 0.15. Hmm, 2000 times 0.15 is 300, and 80 times 0.15 is 12. So, 300 + 12 is 312. So, total cost is $312.

Wait, let me verify that. 2080 times 0.15. Alternatively, 2080 times 15 divided by 100. So, 2080 times 15 is 31200, divided by 100 is 312. Yeah, that's correct.

So, putting it all together: Gary does laundry 104 times a year, each time using 20 gallons, so 2080 gallons. At $0.15 per gallon, that's $312. So, the total amount he spends on water for laundry in a year is $312.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, 52 weeks times 2 is 104. 104 times 20 is 2080. 2080 times 0.15. Let me do it another way. 2080 times 0.15 is the same as 2080 times 3/20. So, 2080 divided by 2 is 1040, times 3 is 3120. Then, divided by 100 is 31.2. Wait, that can't be right because 2080 times 0.15 is 312. Wait,
