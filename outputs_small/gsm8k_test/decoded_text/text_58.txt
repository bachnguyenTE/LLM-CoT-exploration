Q: Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Okay, so Stephen ordered some groceries online, and his final bill came out to $40.00. But wait, that's not the total he paid because there were some extra fees. Let me try to figure out what all the fees are and how they add up.

First, the problem says that because it was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total. Hmm, so that means 25% of the original total is added as a delivery fee. Then, they also charged him $3.00 in delivery fees. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. So, I need to calculate all these fees and add them to the original $40.00 to find the final price.

Let me break it down step by step. The original total is $40.00. Then, there's a 25% delivery fee. So, I need to calculate 25% of $40.0. Let me write that down:

25% of $40.00 is 0.25 multiplied by 40.00. Let me compute that. 0.25 * 40.00. Hmm, 0.25 times 40 is 10, so 0.25 times 40.00 is 10.00. So, that's $10.00.

Then, there's an additional $3.00 in delivery fees. So, that's straightforward. So, the total fees so far are $10.00 plus $3.00, which is $13.00.

But wait, Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. So, that's another fee. So, adding that to the previous total: $13.00 + $4.00 = $17.00.

So, the total fees are $17.00. Now, adding that to the original $40.00. Wait, hold on, is the original $40.00 the total before any fees? Or is it the final bill before fees? Let me read the question again.

"Stephen placed an online order for groceries. His final bill came to $40.00. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?"

So, the final bill was $40.00, which includes all the fees. So, the $40.00 is the total after adding the 25% fee and the $3.00 delivery fee, plus the tip. So, actually, the $40.00 is the amount Stephen paid, which includes all the fees. So, I think I need to reverse engineer it.

Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. It says, "Stephen's final bill came to $40.0. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?"

So, the $40.00 is the total after all fees. So, the $40.00 is the amount Stephen paid, which includes the 25% delivery fee and the $3.00 delivery fee, plus the tip. So, to find the original total before fees, I need to subtract the fees from the final bill.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the final price after the extra fees. So, maybe the $40.00 is the amount after fees, and we need to find the original total before fees. So, let me think.

Let me denote the original total as x. Then, the delivery fee is 25% of x, which is 0.25x. Then, there's an additional $3.00 delivery fee, and a tip of $4.00. So, the total amount Stephen paid is x + 0.25x + 3.00 + 4.00.

So, that's x + 0.25x + 3.00 + 4.00. Let me compute that: x + 0.25x is 1.25x, and 3.00 + 4.00 is 7.00. So, total amount is 1.25x + 7.00.

But the problem says that the final
