Q: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Ron has a pothole in front of his house, and if it doesn't get fixed, it's going to cost his car $450 worth of damage. That seems like a significant expense. On the other hand, the city council won't fix it themselves, and if Ron fixes it himself, he'll get fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, Ron has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. 

So, the question is asking how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. That means I need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then subtract that from the potential damage to find the savings.

Let me list out the costs:

1. **Damage to the car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:** $450
2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance if Ron fixes it:** $120
3. **Cost of asphalt:** 3 buckets * $25 per bucket

I think the total cost Ron will incur if he fixes the pothole is the sum of the fine and the asphalt cost. Then, the savings would be the difference between the potential damage and this total cost.

Let me calculate the asphalt cost first. 3 buckets at $25 each would be 3 * 25 = $75.

So, the total cost if he fixes the pothole is $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.

Now, the potential damage is $450. So, the savings would be $450 (damage) - $195 (total cost) = $255.

Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.

Asphalt: 3 * 25 = 75. That's correct.

Total cost: 120 + 75 = 195. That's correct.

Savings: 450 - 195 = 255. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's right.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The damage is $450, and the total cost is $195. So, the difference is indeed $255. So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

Wait, but is the fine $120 or is it $120 per something? Let me check the problem again.

"the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself." So, it's a one-time fine of $120, not per bucket or anything. So, that's correct.

So, adding the fine and the asphalt cost gives the total amount he has to pay if he fixes the pothole. So, the savings would be the difference between the damage and the total cost.

So, 450 - 195 = 255. So, he saves $255.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the fine $120 or is it $120 per something? The problem says "fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself." So, it's a one-time fine of $120. So, that's correct.

So, the total cost is $120 + $75 = $195. So, the savings is $450 - $195 = $255.

Wait, but 450 minus 195 is 255? Let me do the subtraction again.

450 - 195:

450 - 100 = 352

352 - 95 = 257

Wait, that's 257, not 255. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial subtraction.

Wait, 450 - 195 is 257, but 450 - 195 is 255? Wait, no, 450 - 195.

Let me do it step by step:

450 - 195:

Start from the units place: 0 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place.

Tens place is 5, so borrow 1, making it 4, and units place becomes 10.

10 - 5 = 5.

Now, tens place: 4 - 9. Can't do that, so borrow from the hundreds place.

Hundreds place is 4, so borrow
