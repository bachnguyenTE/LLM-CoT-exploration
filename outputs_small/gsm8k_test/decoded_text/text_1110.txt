Q: Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Soledad and her hiking trip. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Soledad works in a windowless office but loves the outdoors. She's going on a vacation for the entire month of June, which is 30 days. She can't wait to hike 9,300 miles during that time. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. The question is asking how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. She's going to hike 9,300 miles in June, which is 30 days. She's going to do this twice a day, each time covering 125 miles. So, first, maybe I should figure out how many miles she plans to hike in total if she does it twice a day for 30 days.

Wait, so if she walks 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day. So, 125 times 2 is 250. So, 250 miles per day. Then, over 30 days, that would be 250 multiplied by 30. Let me calculate that.

250 times 30. Let me do 250 times 30 first, which is 7,500, and then 250 times 3 is 750. So, adding those together, 7,500 plus 750 is 8,250. Wait, that can't be right because the total is supposed to be 9,300 miles. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, no, hold on. 250 miles per day times 30 days is 250 * 30. Let me compute that again. 250 * 30. 250 * 30 is 250 * 3 *10, which is 750 *10, which is 7,500. Wait, that's not 9,300. Hmm, so maybe my initial calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Soledad is going to hike 9,300 miles in June, which is 30 days. She's going to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, 125 *2 is 250 per day. So, 250 *30 is 7,500. But she needs to do 9,300 miles. So, 9,300 minus 7,500 is 1,800 miles. So, she needs to do 1,800 more miles over the 30 days.

So, 1,800 divided by 30 is 60. So, she needs to hike 60 more miles per day. So, the answer is 60.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, 250 miles per day is her current plan, which is 7,500 miles. She needs 9,300, so 9,300 minus 7,500 is 1,800. 1,800 divided by 30 is 60. So, yeah, she needs to add 60 miles per day.

Wait, but let me think again. Is 250 miles per day correct? She walks twice a day, 125 miles each time. So, 125 *2 is 250. So, that's correct. So, 250 per day, 30 days is 7,500. 9,300 minus 7,500 is 1,800. 1,800 divided by 30 is 60. So, yeah, 60 more miles per day.

Wait, but the problem says she is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, 125 *2 is 250. So, 250 per day. So, 250 per day is her current plan, which is 7,500. 9,300 minus 7,500 is 1,800. 1,800 divided by 30 is 60. So, yeah, 60 more miles per day.

Wait, but let me make sure that 250 per day
