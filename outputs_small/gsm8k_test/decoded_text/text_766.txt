Q: Marissa bought a ball at the store for $20. If she had $80 on her and used the rest of the money to buy her brother Jimmy, candy bars sold at $5 each, how many candy bars did Marissa buy for Jimmy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Marissa bought a ball for $20, and she had $80 on her own. She used the rest of her money to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy, which are sold at $5 each. The question is asking how many candy bars she bought for Jimmy. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much money Marissa has left after buying the ball. She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, I should subtract the cost of the ball from her initial amount. That would be $80 minus $20. Let me write that down:

$80 - $20 = ?

Wait, hold on, I think I need to make sure about the units here. It says she had $80, which is probably $80.00, so that's $80.00. Similarly, the ball is $20.00. So, subtracting $20 from $80 would be $60.00. Let me confirm that:

$80.00
- $20.00
= $60.00

Yes, that makes sense. So, after buying the ball, Marissa has $60 left. Now, she uses this remaining money to buy candy bars that are sold at $5 each. The question is, how many candy bars can she buy with $60?

To find out, I need to divide the remaining money by the price per candy bar. So, that would be $60 divided by $5 per candy bar. Let me write that out:

$60.00 ÷ $5.00 = ?

Hmm, 5 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 1. Then, bringing down the 0, 5 goes into 10 twice. So, 5 goes into 60 twelve times with no remainder. Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 5 times 12 is 10, which is 10. So, 5 times 12 is 60. So, yes, 5 goes into 60 twelve times. So, Marissa can buy 12 candy bars with her remaining $60.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. Sometimes when I do division in my head, I might get confused. Let me write it out:

5 | 60

5 goes into 6 once (1), multiply 1 by 5, subtract from 6, you get 1. Bring down the 0, making it 10. 5 goes into 10 twice (2). Multiply 2 by 5, subtract from 10, you get 0. So, the result is 12. So, yes, 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Wait, just to double-check everything. She started with $80, spent $20 on a ball, so she has $60 left. Each candy bar is $5, so 60 divided by 5 is 12. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as how many times 5 fits into 60. Since 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 12 is 60, so yes, 12 times. So, that's consistent.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 12 candy bars.

**Final Answer**
Marissa bought \boxed{12} candy bars for Jimmy.
</think>

Marissa bought a ball for $20 and had $80 on her own. She used the remaining money to buy candy bars sold at $5 each. 

First, we calculate the remaining money after buying the ball:
\[
80 - 20 = 60
\]
Next, we determine how many candy bars she can buy with $60:
\[
60 \div 5 = 12
\]

Thus, Marissa bought \boxed{12} candy bars for Jimmy.
