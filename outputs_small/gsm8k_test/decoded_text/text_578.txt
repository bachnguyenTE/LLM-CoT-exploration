Q: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the final value of the number train. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down step by step. First, the starting value is 20. Then, we have some operations involving this starting value. Let me write this out in my mind.

First, the starting value is 20. Then, we add half of the number to this starting value. Wait, hold on, is the number the same as the starting value? The problem says "a number train," but it doesn't specify if the number is the same as the starting value. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says: "Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12." So, the starting value is 20, which is 20. Then, it says "this starting value plus half the number." Hmm, so is the "number" the same as the starting value? Or is it a different number?

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says "a number train," but then it refers to "half the number." So, maybe the number is the same as the starting value? Or is it a different number? Hmm.

Wait, let me read it again: "Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12." So, the starting value is 20. Then, "this starting value plus half the number." So, is "this number" the same as the starting value? Or is it a different number?

Wait, the problem says "a number train," but then it refers to "half the number." So, maybe the number is the same as the starting value? So, half of 20 is 10. So, starting value is 20, plus half the number, which is 10, so 20 + 10 is 30. Then, that result was divided by 5, so 30 divided by 5 is 6. Then, the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, starting value is 20, minus 12 is 18. So, 6 multiplied by 18 is 108.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. Maybe the "number" is different from the starting value. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says: "Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12." So, the starting value is 20. Then, "this starting value plus half the number." So, is "this number" the same as the number on the number train? Or is it a different number?

Wait, the problem is a bit confusing. It says "a number train," but then it refers to "half the number." So, maybe the number is the same as the starting value? So, half of 20 is 10. So, 20 + 10 is 30. Then, 30 divided by 5 is 6. Then, 6 multiplied by (20 - 12). 20 -12 is 8. So, 6 times 8 is 48. Wait, that's different from the previous answer.

Wait, so which interpretation is correct? Is the "number" the same as the starting value, or is it a different number? Hmm. The problem says "a number train," but then it refers to "half the number." So, maybe the number is the same as the starting value. So, half of 20 is 10, so 20 +10 is 30. Then, 30 divided by 5 is 6. Then, 6 multiplied by (20 -12). 20 -12 is 8. So, 6 times 8 is 48.

Alternatively, if the "number" is different, then we don't know what it is. So, maybe the problem is written in a way that the number is the same as the starting value. So, half of 20 is 10,
