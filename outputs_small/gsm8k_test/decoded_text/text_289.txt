Q: A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars traveling in fast and slow lanes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a car in the fast lane is going at 60 miles per hour. Then, there's another car in the slow lane that's going at half that speed. So, the slow car must be going 30 miles per hour because half of 60 is 30. That makes sense.

Now, the fast lane car travels a total of 480 miles. I need to find out how long it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to use the formula for distance, which is distance equals speed multiplied by time. The formula is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

I can rearrange this formula to solve for time because I know the distance and the speed. The formula for time would be:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Alright, so for the fast lane car, I can calculate the time it took to travel 480 miles. Let me plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} \]

Let me do that division. 60 goes into 480 how many times? Well, 60 times 8 is 480, so that's 8 hours. So, the fast lane car took 8 hours to go 480 miles.

Now, I need to find out how long the slow lane car took to cover the same distance. Since the distance is the same, 480 miles, but the speed is different, I can use the same formula but solve for time again.

So, for the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} \]

Wait, 30 mph? Let me make sure. The slow car is half the speed of the fast car, which was 60 mph, so yes, 30 mph. Okay, so now I need to compute 480 divided by 30.

Hmm, 30 goes into 480 how many times? Let me think. 30 times 16 is 480 because 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 6 is 180, so 300 plus 180 is 480. So, 16 times 30 is 480. Therefore, the time is 16 hours.

Wait, so the slow car took 16 hours to cover the same distance. That seems a bit longer, but since it's going slower, it makes sense. Let me double-check my calculations.

For the fast car: 60 mph for 8 hours is 60*8=480 miles. Correct.

For the slow car: 30 mph for 16 hours is 30*16. Let me compute that. 30*10=300, 30*6=180, so 300+180=480. Yep, that's correct.

So, the time taken by the slow car is 16 hours. Therefore, the answer should be 16 hours.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance." So, yeah, 16 hours is the time. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Alternatively, I can think about the ratio of their speeds. The fast car is twice as fast as the slow car because 60 is double 30. So, if the fast car takes 8 hours, the slow car, being slower, should take twice as long, which is 16 hours. That's another way to see it.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 16 hours. I think that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is \boxed{16} hours.

The fast lane car is traveling at 60 miles per hour and covers a distance of 480 miles. To find the time it took, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the fast lane car:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles
