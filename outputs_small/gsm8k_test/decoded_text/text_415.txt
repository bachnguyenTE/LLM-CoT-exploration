Q: While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Joanne and her sister gathering apples. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Hmm, let's see.

First, let me parse the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Her sister gathers half this amount from the shortest trees. So, that would be half of 30, which is 15 apples from the shortest trees.
3. The sister gathers more apples from the average trees. But it doesn't specify exactly how much more, just that she gathers more. Wait, but the problem also says that compared to Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many from the shortest trees. Hmm, so maybe I need to consider the total apples gathered by both.

Wait, let me read that again: "Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees."

So, the sister gathers twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne. Joanne gathered 30 from the tallest trees, so the sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Similarly, the sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne. Joanne gathered 15 from the shortest trees, so the sister gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

And the sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees. So, the only apples the sister gathers are from the tallest and shortest trees.

Now, the problem says that the combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. So, Joanne gathers 30 from the tallest, 15 from the shortest, and some number from the average trees. Her sister gathers 60 from the tallest, 45 from the shortest, and 0 from the average.

So, let me write down the total apples each person gathers:

- Joanne: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + x (average) = 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
- Her sister: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) + 0 (average) = 105

So, the total combined is Joanne's total plus her sister's total: (45 + x) + 105 = 150 + x

And this is equal to 500. So, 150 + x = 500

Therefore, x = 500 - 150 = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, Joanne has 30 from tallest, 15 from shortest, and 350 from average. That's 30 + 15 + 350 = 400 + 350? Wait, no, 30 +15 is 45, plus 350 is 395. Wait, that can't be right because 395 + 105 (sister's total) is 500. Wait, 395 + 105 is 500. Wait, 395 + 105 is 500? Let me add 395 + 100 is 405, plus 5 is 450? Wait, no, 395 + 105: 300 + 100 is 410, 90 + 5 is 95, so 411 + 95 is 506? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 395 + 105: 395 + 105 is 500? Wait, 395 + 100 is 495, plus 5 is 500. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but 30 +15 +350 is 398? Wait, 30 +15 is 45, plus 350 is 395. 395 +105 is 500. So, that's correct.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says that the sister gathers twice as many from the tallest trees and 3 times as many from the shortest trees. So, if Joanne gathered 30 from tallest, sister gathered 60, which is
