Q: Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?

Okay, so Felix noticed that kids are stuck in trees, and he wants to charge them for getting their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every time he climbs up a branch, it costs him $0.25. During the week, he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand the problem. Felix charges kids based on the height of the branches he has to climb. Each branch costs $0.25. So, if he climbs up a branch, he gets paid $0.25. 

He made a total of $105 during the week. I need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. So, first, I should figure out the total number of branches he climbed during the week, and then divide that by the number of days in the week to get the average per day.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many days are in the week. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a standard week, which is 7 days? I think that's a safe assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, if the week has 7 days, and he made $105, and each branch costs $0.25, then the total number of branches he climbed is the total money earned divided by the cost per branch.

Let me write that down:

Total money earned = $105.00
Cost per branch = $0.25
Number of branches climbed = Total money / Cost per branch

So, plugging in the numbers:

Number of branches = 105 / 0.25

Wait, hold on, is that right? Because 105 divided by 0.25. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4. So, 105 * 4 = 420. So, he climbed 420 branches during the week.

But wait, that seems like a lot. 420 branches in a week? That would be 60 branches per day on average. That seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me double-check. If each branch is $0.25, then 105 divided by 0.25 is indeed 4220. Because 0.25 goes into 1 four times, so 0.25 goes into 105 420 times. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 420 branches in a week. Then, to find the average per day, we divide that by 7 days.

Average branches per day = 420 / 7 = 60.

So, Felix climbs an average of 60 branches per day.

Wait, but 60 branches per day seems like a lot. Is that realistic? Maybe, depending on the height of the trees and how many branches are in the trees. But since the problem doesn't give us any specific information about the number of branches in the trees, we have to go with the given numbers.

So, if he made $105, and each branch is $0.25, then 105 divided by 0.25 is 420 branches. Divided by 7 days is 60 branches per day.

So, the answer should be 60 branches per day.

But let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. It says "how many branches did he climb per day on average." So, 420 branches over 7 days is 60 per day. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in dollars and cents, so maybe the total amount is $105.00, which is $105.00? Wait, no, the way it's written is "On average, how many branches did he climb per day?" So, the total amount is $105, which is $105.00, but that's probably a typo, because $105 is a standard amount. Maybe it's $105.00? Hmm, but the user wrote "On average, how many branches did he climb per day?" with the amount as $105. So, maybe it's $105.00, but that's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the user meant $105.00, which is $105.00. So, 105.00 is probably a typo, and it's supposed to be 105.00. So, maybe that's why I was confused.

But regardless, if it's $10
