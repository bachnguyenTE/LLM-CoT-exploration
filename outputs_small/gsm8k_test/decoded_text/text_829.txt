Q: Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?

Okay, so I have this problem about Boris and his chocolate factory. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Wait, that seems like a typo. It should probably be 50,000 bars? Or maybe 50,000? Hmm, maybe it's 50,000? Let me check. Oh, no, actually, 50,000 is 55 thousand and 5 hundred? Wait, no, 50,000 would be 50 thousand? Hmm, maybe I should just go with the number as given: 50,000 bars each month. But that seems like a lot for a month. Maybe it's 50,000 bars each month? Wait, 50,000 is 55,000? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 50,000? That would be 55 thousand. Hmm, maybe I should just go with the number as given: 50,000 bars each month. But that seems like a lot. Maybe it's 50,000? That would be 55 thousand. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should just proceed with the given numbers and see if it makes sense.

Wait, actually, the problem says Boris produces 50,000 bars each month. So, 50,000 bars. That seems like a lot for a month, but maybe it's correct. So, 50,000 bars each month. Okay, moving on.

So, the problem says Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. So, week one: 8,000 bars. Then, the second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. So, week two: half of 8,000. Let me calculate that. Half of 8,000 is 4,000. So, week two: 4,000 bars.

Then, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So, week three: three times 8,000. That would be 24,000 bars. So, week three: 24,000 bars.

Now, the question is asking how much does he produce the fourth week? So, we need to figure out the production for week four.

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify a pattern or a progression beyond the first three weeks. So, maybe it's a simple pattern where each week's production is a multiple of the previous week's production? Let me see.

Week one: 8,000

Week two: half of week one, which is 4,000

Week three: three times week one, which is 24,000

So, the pattern is: week one is 8,000, week two is 0.5 times week one, week three is 3 times week one. So, is there a pattern here? It seems like week two is 0.5 times week one, week three is 3 times week one. So, maybe week four is 0.5 times week three? Or 3 times week three? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that each week's production is multiplied by a certain factor. Let me see.

From week one to week two: 8,000 to 4,000. So, that's a factor of 0.5.

From week two to week three: 4,000 to 24,000. So, that's a factor of 6.

Hmm, so the factors are 0.5 and 6. That doesn't seem like a consistent pattern. Maybe it's a different kind of pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the production each week is increasing by a certain multiple each week. Let me see.

From week one to week two: 8,000 to 4,000. So, that's a decrease by half.

From week two to week three: 4,000 to 24,000. So, that's an increase by 6 times.

Hmm, so it's not a consistent pattern. Maybe it's alternating between multiplying by 0.5 and 6? So, week one: 8,000, week two: 4,000 (0.5 times), week three: 24,000 (6 times), week four: 0.5 times week three, which would be 12,000, or 6
