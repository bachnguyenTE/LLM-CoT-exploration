Q: On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, college student Kimo has three 1-hour  classes each day.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the structure of the school week. The problem says that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, each week has 7 days, and each day has a specific number of classes.

The semester has 16 weeks of school. So, I need to calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes over these 16 weeks (since 16 weeks would be 16 weeks, but wait, actually, 16 weeks is the total, so each week is 7 days, so 16 weeks is 16*7=1112 days? Wait, no, the problem says "16 weeks of school." So, 16 weeks, each week being 7 days, so total days are 16*7=112 days. But wait, actually, the problem says "In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?" So, perhaps it's 16 weeks, each week being 7 days, so 16 weeks is 16*7=112 days. But wait, 16 weeks is 16*7=112 days, but the problem says "16 weeks of school." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says: "In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school." So, 16 weeks. So, each week is 7 days, so 16*7=112 weeks? Wait, no, 16 weeks. So, 16 weeks is 16*7=112 days. So, 112 days in total.

But wait, the problem is about how many hours Kimo spends attending classes. So, I need to calculate the total number of class hours over 16 weeks.

So, each week has 7 days, and each day has a certain number of classes. So, perhaps I can calculate the number of classes per week and then multiply by 16 weeks.

Let me structure this:

First, calculate the number of classes Kimo has each week.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 days, each with 3 1-hour classes.

So, that's 3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 days, each with 2 2-hour classes.

So, that's 2 days * (2*2) hours/day = 2*4=8 hours per week.

So, total per week: 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 3 days, each with 3 1-hour classes. So, 3*3=9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2 days, each with 2 2-hour classes. So, 2*2=4 days, each with 2 hours, so 4*2=8 hours.

So, total per week: 9 + 8=17 hours per week.

Wait, that's 17 hours per week. So, over 16 weeks, that would be 16*17=272 hours.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, 16 weeks, each week has 7 days, so 16 weeks is 16*7=112 days. But the problem says "16 weeks of school," so 16 weeks. So, 16 weeks, each week being 7 days, so 16*7=112 days. But the problem is about the number of hours, so perhaps I should calculate per week.

Wait, but the problem says "In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?" So, perhaps it's 16 weeks, so 16*17=112 days, but the problem is about the number of hours, so maybe I should calculate the total number of class hours over 16 weeks.

Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the school has 16 weeks, so 16 weeks, each week being 7 days, so 16*7=112 days. But the problem is about the number of hours, so perhaps I should calculate the total number of class hours over 16 weeks.

Wait, but the problem is about how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in
