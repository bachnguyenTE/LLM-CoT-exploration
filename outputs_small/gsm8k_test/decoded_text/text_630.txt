Q: Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Tiffany measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Hmm, so that means out of 100 riders, 25% can ride without falling. Let me write that down.

Total riders = 100

Percentage of riders who can stay upright = 25%

So, the number of riders who can stay upright is 25% of 100. Let me calculate that.

25% of 100 is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Okay, so 25 riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet. Now, of these riders, 60% are women. So, 60% of the 25 riders are women. Let me find out how many women that is.

60% of 25 is 0.62 * 25. Wait, let me do that multiplication properly.

0.62 * 25. Hmm, 0.62 * 20 is 12.4, and 0.62 * 5 is 3.1, so adding those together, 12.4 + 3.1 = 15.5. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have half a person. Maybe I should do it another way.

Alternatively, 60% of 25 is 0.6 * 25. 0.6 * 20 is 12, and 0.6 * 5 is 3, so 12 + 3 = 15. So, 15 women can stay upright.

So, if 15 women are among the 25 riders who can stay upright, then the remaining must be men. Let me subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

Number of men = Total upright riders - Number of women = 25 - 15 = 10.

Wait, so 10 men can stay upright on the wave. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total riders: 100

25% of 100 is 25. That seems right.

60% of 25 is 15. Let me calculate 60% of 25 again. 60% of 25 is 15, so yes, that's correct.

So, 25 - 15 = 10. That seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "how many men can stay upright on the wave." So, is the answer 10? That seems straightforward.

But let me think again. Is there any chance that the percentage of riders who can stay upright is 25%, but maybe the percentage of men among the riders is different? Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention anything about the percentage of men or women among the riders. It just says that when the wave is over 30 feet, 25% of the riders can stay upright, and of those, 60% are women. So, the rest are men.

So, the number of men who can stay upright is 10. So, I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me go through the steps again.

1. Total riders = 100.

2. 25% of these riders can stay upright: 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

3. Of these 25 riders, 60% are women: 0.60 * 25 = 15 women.

4. Therefore, the number of men is 25 - 15 = 10.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 10 men.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "how many men can stay upright on the wave." So, is the answer 10? Or is there a different interpretation?

Wait, maybe I misread the percentages. Let me check the problem again.

"When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?"

So, 25% of 100 riders is 25 riders. 60% of 25 riders are women, which is 15. So, 25 -15=10 men.

So,
