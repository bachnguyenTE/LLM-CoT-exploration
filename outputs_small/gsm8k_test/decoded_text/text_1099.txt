Q: The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the time it takes for each slide to be ridden.

For the biggest slide, which is 300 feet long, and people slide down at a rate of 60 feet per minute, I can calculate the time by dividing the length of the slide by the sliding speed. So, 300 feet divided by 60 feet per minute equals 5 minutes.

Next, for the second biggest slide, which is 240 feet long, and people slide down at a rate of 80 feet per minute, I'll do the same calculation. Dividing 240 feet by 80 feet per minute gives me 2.875 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest, I'll subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide. That is, 5 minutes minus 2.875 minutes, which equals 2.125 minutes.

Finally, I'll convert 2.125 minutes into minutes and seconds for a clearer understanding. 0.125 minutes is equivalent to 7.5 seconds, so the total time difference is 2 minutes and 7.5 seconds.

To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time for each slide:**

   - **Biggest Slide:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length of Slide}}{\text{Sliding Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   
   - **Second Biggest Slide:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length of Slide}}{\text{Sliding Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Find the difference in time:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert the difference into minutes and seconds:**
   \[
   2 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes and } 0 \text{ seconds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ minutes}}
\]
