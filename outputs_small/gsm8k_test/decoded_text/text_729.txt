Q: At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day. By midday 2/5 of the people had voted and by 16:00 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. What's the number of those who had not voted by 16:00?

Okay, so I have this problem here about people voting at a polling station. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, at 8:00 AM, there were 5000 people lined up to vote on election day. That's the total number of people initially. Then, by midday, which I think is 12:00 PM, 2/5 of the people had voted. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many people that is. 

So, if there were 5000 people and 2/5 voted by midday, I can calculate that by multiplying 5000 by 2/5. Let me write that down:

Number of people who voted by midday = (2/5) * 5000

Let me compute that. 5000 divided by 5 is 1000, right? So, 2 times that would be 2200. So, 2200 people voted by midday. 

Okay, so now, the total number of people is 5000, and 2200 voted by midday. That means the remaining people at midday would be 5000 - 2200. Let me calculate that:

Remaining people at midday = 5000 - 2200

Hmm, 5000 minus 2200. Let me subtract: 5000 - 2000 is 3500, and then subtract another 200, which gives 3300. So, 3300 people remained at midday.

Now, the problem says that by 16:00 PM, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, I need to find out how many people that is. 

So, the remaining people at midday are 3300, and 2/3 of them voted by 16:00 PM. So, let me calculate that:

Number of people who voted after midday = (2/3) * 3300

Calculating that: 3300 divided by 3 is 1100, so 2 times that is 2200. So, 2200 people voted after midday.

So, now, to find out how many people had voted in total by 16:00 PM, I need to add the number who voted by midday and the number who voted after midday.

Total people who voted = 2200 (by midday) + 2200 (after midday) = 4400.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high because the total number of people was only 5000. So, 4400 voted, which would mean 5000 - 4400 = 600 people didn't vote by 16:00 PM. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit counterintuitive.

Wait, let me go back step by step.

First, total people: 5000.

By midday, 2/5 voted. So, 2/5 of 5000 is indeed 2000/5 = 4000? Wait, no, 5000 divided by 5 is 1000, so 2/5 is 2000. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 5000 divided by 5 is 1000, so 2/5 is 2000. So, 2000 people voted by midday. So, remaining people at midday would be 5000 - 2200 = 3300. That part seems correct.

Then, by 16:00 PM, 2/3 of the remaining 3300 had voted. So, 2/3 of 3300 is 2200. So, 2200 people voted after midday. So, total people who voted is 2200 + 2200 = 4400. So, 4400 voted, which is 4400 out of 5000. So, 5500 - 4400 = 1100 people didn't vote by 16:00 PM.

Wait, but 11100 is the number who didn't vote. But let me think again: 5000 total, 2200 voted by midday, 2
