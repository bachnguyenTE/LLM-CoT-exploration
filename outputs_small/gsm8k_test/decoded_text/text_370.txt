Q: A hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market. A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper. The market price is $400, and a DIY version saves him 20% after considering materials. I need to figure out how much Ethan actually paid for his own wallpaper. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the market price is $400, which is the original cost. The DIY version saves 20%, so that means Ethan is saving 20% on the original price. So, I need to calculate 20% of $400 and then subtract that from the original price to find out how much he paid for his own wallpaper.

Let me write that down step by step. The savings amount is 20% of $400. To calculate percentages, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So, I multiply 400 by 0.20.

Calculating that: 400 * 0.20. Let me do the multiplication. 400 times 0.2 is the same as 400 * 20 * 0.01, right? Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 400 by 0.2. So, 400 * 0.2. 400 divided by 10 is 40, so 400 * 0.2 is 80. So, the savings amount is $80.

Wait, let me double-check that. 10% of 400 is 44, so 20% would be double that, which is 88. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 10% is 44, so 20% is 88, not 80. So, actually, the savings is $88.

So, Ethan saved $88 on the original price. Therefore, the total cost he paid is the original price minus the savings. So, 400 minus 88. Let me subtract that. 400 minus 80 would be 320, but since it's 88, it's 3122. Wait, no, 400 minus 88 is 312. So, Ethan paid $312 for his own wallpaper.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 400 minus 80 is 320, and then minus 8 more is 312. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 400 minus 88. 400 minus 80 is 320, then minus 8 is 312. Yep, that's correct.

So, the total cost Ethan paid is $312. Wait, hold on, 400 minus 88 is 312? Wait, 400 minus 88 is 312? No, 400 minus 80 is 320, minus 8 is 312. So, yes, 312. So, the total cost is $312.

Wait, but let me think again. If the market price is $400, and the DIY saves 20%, so the DIY price is 80% of the original. So, 0.80 * 400. Let me calculate that. 0.80 times 400 is 320. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Hmm, so now I'm confused.

Wait, so which one is correct? Is the savings 20% or is the DIY price 80% of the original? The problem says the DIY saves 20% after considering materials. So, that means the savings is 20%, so the total cost is 80% of the original. So, 0.80 * 400 is 320. But earlier, I thought it was 312.

Wait, so which is it? Let me read the problem again. It says, "A hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market. A DIY will save 20% after considering the materials cost." So, the savings is 20%, so the total cost is 80% of the original. So, 0.80 * 400 is 320. So, that would be $320.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the savings is 20%, so 20% of 400 is 80, so 4
