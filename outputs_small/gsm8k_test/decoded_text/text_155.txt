Q: Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Bill bakes different types of baked goods every day, and I need to figure out how long they will be if he puts all of them end to end. The question is asking for the total length in feet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what Bill does each day:

- He bakes 300 rolls.
- He bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- He bakes 60 baguettes.

Each type of baked good has a different length:

- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Each baguette is two feet long.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to calculate the total length of all these baked goods combined and then convert that from inches to feet. That makes sense.

Let me start by calculating the total length for each type of baked good separately. That way, I can add them up without getting confused.

Starting with the rolls. He bakes 300 rolls, each 4 inches long. So, the total length for the rolls would be:

300 rolls * 4 inches per roll.

Wait, hold on, 300? Is that 300 or 300? Let me check the original problem. It says, "Bill bakes 300 rolls," so that's 300. So, 300? Wait, 300 is 3 hundreds, 3 tens, and 0 ones. So, 300. So, 300 rolls. Okay, that's 300. So, 300 rolls.

So, 300 * 4 inches.

Let me compute that. 300 * 4. 300 * 4 is 1200 inches. So, the rolls contribute 1200 inches.

Next, the croissants. He bakes 120 croissants, each 6 inches long. So, total length for croissants is:

120 * 6 inches.

120 * 6 is 720 inches. So, 720 inches from the croissants.

Now, the baguettes. He bakes 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long. Wait, 2 feet? Hmm, but the other items are in inches. I need to make sure all units are consistent before adding them up. So, I should convert feet to inches or inches to feet. Let me choose inches because the other two are in inches.

Since 1 foot is 12 inches, so 2 feet is 24 inches. So, each baguette is 24 inches long.

Therefore, total length for baguettes is:

60 * 24 inches.

60 * 24. Let me compute that. 60 * 20 is 1200, and 60 *4 is 240, so 1200 + 240 is 1440 inches. So, 1440 inches from the baguettes.

Now, I have the total lengths in inches for each type:

- Rolls: 1200 inches
- Croissants: 720 inches
- Baguettes: 1440 inches

Now, I need to add all these together to get the total length.

So, 1200 + 720 + 1440.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1200 + 720. Let's see, 1200 + 700 is 1900, and then +20 is 1920. So, 1920 inches.

Then, add 1440 to that. 1920 + 1440.

Let me break that down. 1920 + 1400 is 3320, and then +40 is 3360. So, total is 3360 inches.

Now, the question is asking for the total length in feet. So, I need to convert 3360 inches to feet.

Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I can divide the total inches by 12 to get feet.

So, 3360 / 12.

Let me compute that. 3360 divided by 12.

Well, 12 goes into 33 two times (12*2=24), remainder 9. Bring down the 6, making 96. 12 goes into 96 eight times (12*8=9
