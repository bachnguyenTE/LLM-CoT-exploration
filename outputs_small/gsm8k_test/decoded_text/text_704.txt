Q: Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, how much money did he have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. Then Gerald spent $10 on a book, and I need to figure out how much money he had left. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios represent parts of a whole. So, if it's 3:2, that means the total parts are 3 + 2, which is 5 parts. So, each part must be equal to $100 divided by 5. Let me write that down.

Total amount = $100
Ratio parts = 3 + 2 = 5
So, each part = $100 / 5 = $20

Okay, so each part is $20. That means Gerald has 3 parts, and Julia has 2 parts. Let me calculate how much each of them has.

Gerald's share = 3 parts * $20/part = $60
Julia's share = 2 parts * $20/part = $40

Wait, let me check that. 3 times 20 is 60, and 2 times 20 is 40. Adding those together, 60 + 40 is 100. Yep, that adds up correctly. So, Gerald has $60, Julia has $40.

Now, the problem says Gerald spent $10 on a book. So, I need to subtract that from his share to find out how much he has left. Let me do that.

Gerald's remaining money = $60 - $10 = $50

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is about ratios and spending, so I think I covered all the steps. First, I found the value of each part, then calculated each person's share, and then subtracted the amount spent.

Wait, just to double-check, if the ratio is 3:2, and the total is $100, then 3 parts are $60 and 2 parts are $40. So, 3:2 is 60:40, which simplifies to 3:2 when you divide both by 20. Wait, no, 60 divided by 20 is 3, and 40 divided by 20 is 2. So, yeah, that's correct.

So, Gerald had $60, spent $10, so he has $50 left. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a simple ratio problem, and then a straightforward subtraction. So, I think the answer is $50.

**Final Answer**
Gerald had $\boxed{50}$ dollars left.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. To find out how much money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book, we follow these steps:

1. The total ratio parts are 3 + 2 = 5.
2. Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.
3. Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he had 3 * $20 = $60.
4. Gerald spent $10 on a book, so the remaining money is $60 - $10 = $50.

Thus, Gerald had $\boxed{50}$ dollars left.
