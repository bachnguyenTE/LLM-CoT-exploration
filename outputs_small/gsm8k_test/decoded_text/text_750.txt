Q: Candy has a chair rental business. During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day; but during weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. If this continues, how many chairs in total will Candy be able to rent out in two 4-week months?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

There are 4 weeks in a month, so 2 months would have 8 weeks in total.

Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. Therefore, in 8 weeks, there are 40 weekdays and 16 weekend days.

During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day, so the total chairs rented during weekdays would be 600 chairs.

During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day, so the total chairs rented during weekends would be 1600 chairs.

Adding both amounts together, Candy would be able to rent out a total of 2200 chairs in two 4-week months.

To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate Chairs Rented During Weekdays**
- **Weekdays:** 60 chairs per day
- **Number of Weekdays in 8 Weeks:** 
  - 1 week = 5 weekdays
  - 8 weeks = 8 × 5 = 40 weekdays
- **Total Chairs During Weekdays:** 
  - 60 chairs/day × 40 days = **2280 chairs**

### **Step 2: Calculate Chairs Rented During Weekend Days**
- **Weekend Days:** 10 chairs per day
- **Number of Weekend Days in 8 Weeks:** 
  - 1 week = 2 weekend days
  - 8 weeks = 8 × 2 = 16 weekend days
- **Total Chairs During Weekend Days:** 
  - 10 chairs/day × 16 days = **160 chairs**

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Chairs Rented in Two 4-Week Months**
- **Total Chairs:** 
  - 2280 chairs (weekdays) + 160 chairs (weekend days) = **2440 chairs**

\[
\boxed{2440}
