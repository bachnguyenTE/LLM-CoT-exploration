Q: A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a tomato vendor who wants to switch vendors. Let me try to figure out how much he saves in a week. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. That's his daily production or sale volume. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, but now he's switching to a new vendor who sells them for $0.4 each. So, he's reducing the price per tomato. I need to find out how much he saves each week because of this switch.

Alright, so let's start by calculating how much he used to spend each day. If he buys 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, then his daily expenditure is 500 multiplied by 0.5. Let me write that down:

500 * 0.5 = ?

Hmm, 500 times 0.5. Well, 500 is the same as 500.00, so multiplying by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, which is half. So, half of 500 is 250. So, he used to spend $250 each day.

Now, with the new vendor, he's buying them for $0.4 each. So, his new daily expenditure would be 500 multiplied by 0.4. Let me calculate that:

500 * 0.4 = ?

Again, 500 times 0.4 is the same as 500 divided by 2.5, but wait, no, that's not right. Actually, 0.4 is the same as 4/10, so 500 * 4/10. Let me compute that.

500 * 4 = 2000, and then divide by 10, which is 200. So, he now spends $200 each day.

So, the difference between his old daily expenditure and the new one is 250 - 200 = $50 per day.

Therefore, each day he saves $50. Now, the question is asking how much he saves in a week. Assuming a week is 7 days, so we need to multiply the daily savings by 7.

So, 50 * 7 = 350.

Therefore, he saves $350 a week.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 500 * 0.5: 500 * 0.5 is indeed 250. Then, 500 * 0.4: 500 * 0.4 is 200. The difference is 50. Then, 50 * 7 is 350. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of total savings per week. So, each day, he saves 50, so over 7 days, it's 50*7=350. Yeah, that makes sense.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the total number of tomatoes sold in a week and then computing the savings based on the difference in price.

Let's see, he sells 500 tomatoes a day, so in a week, that's 500*7=3500 tomatoes.

Originally, he bought 3500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, so total cost was 3500*0.5=1750.

With the new vendor, he buys the same 3500 tomatoes at $0.4 each, so total cost is 3500*0.4=1400.

The difference is 1750 - 1400=350. So, same result.

Therefore, he saves $350 a week.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, the answer should be $350.

**Final Answer**
The tomato vendor saves \boxed{350} dollars a week.

The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, so his daily expenditure was:

\[ 500 \times 0.5 = 250 \]

With the new vendor, he buys them for $0.4 each, so his new daily expenditure is:

\[ 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \]

The daily savings is:

\[ 250 - 200 = 50 \]

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by
