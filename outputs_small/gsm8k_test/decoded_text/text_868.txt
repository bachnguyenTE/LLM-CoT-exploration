Okay, so I need to figure out how much Greg will spend on buy enough jello for his son's birthday party. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. If one box makes 10 cups, then for 30 cups, he would need 3 boxes, right? But let me check the problem again. It says a three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups. So, each box makes 10 cups. Got it.

Greg wants to make small jello cups for 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 cups. So, I need to calculate the total number of cups needed. Let me do that first.

30 kids times 4 cups each equals... 30 times 4 is 120 cups. So, Greg needs 120 cups of jello.

Now, each box makes 10 cups. So, how many boxes does he need to buy? I think I can divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per box. So, 120 divided by 10 is 12. So, he needs 12 boxes.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If each box makes 10 cups, then 12 boxes would make 120 cups. Yes, that's exactly what he needs. So, 12 boxes.

Each box is on sale for $1.25. So, to find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of boxes by the price per box. That would be 12 times $1.25.

Let me calculate that. 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3. So, 12 plus 3 is 15. So, the total cost is $15.

Wait, let me double-check my multiplication. 12 times 1.25. Alternatively, 1.25 times 12 is 12.5, and 1.25 times 12 is 2.5. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Maybe I should break it down differently.

1.25 is the same as 5/4. So, 12 boxes would be 12 boxes times 1.25 is 12.50. So, 12 boxes would be 12 times 1.25, which is 12.50. Then, 12 boxes would be 12 times 1.25, which is 15.00. So, yes, $15.00.

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through it again.

He has 30 kids, each needing 4 cups. 30 times 4 is 120 cups. Each box makes 10 cups. So, 120 divided by 10 is 12 boxes. Each box is $1.25, so 12 times 1.25 is 15. So, yes, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the total amount Greg will spend is $15.

**Final Answer**
Greg will spend \boxed{15} dollars on jello.

Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids, each having 4 cups. This requires a total of:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups/kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Each box of jello makes 10 small cups, so the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups/box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Greg will spend \boxed{15} dollars on jello.
