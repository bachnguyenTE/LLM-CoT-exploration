Q: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cynthia buying ice cream. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. That means she eats one serving each day, right? So, over 60 days, how many servings does she eat? Hmm, let me calculate that. If she eats one serving each day, then in 60 days, she would eat 60 servings. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, she buys cartons of ice cream, and each carton has 15 servings. So, each time she buys a carton, she's getting 15 servings. I need to figure out how many cartons she needs to buy to have enough ice cream for 60 servings. 

To find out how many cartons she needs, I can divide the total number of servings she wants by the number of servings per carton. So, that would be 60 servings divided by 15 servings per carton. Let me do that division: 60 ÷ 15. Hmm, 15 goes into 60 how many times? Well, 15 times 4 is 60, right? So, she needs 4 cartons. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 15 times 4 is 60, yes, that's correct. So, she needs 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00, so I need to find out how much 4 cartons will cost. 

To find the total cost, I can multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton. So, that's 4 cartons times $4.00 per carton. Let me calculate that: 4 times 4 is 16, so that's $16.00. 

Wait, hold on, is that right? 4 times 4 is 16, so 4 cartons at $4 each is $16. Yeah, that seems correct. 

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. She eats one serving a night, so in 60 days, she needs 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she needs 60 divided by 15, which is 4 cartons. Each carton is $4, so 4 times 4 is $16. 

Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe the cost per serving? But the problem says each carton is $4.000, so I think that's the way to go. 

Alternatively, if I thought about it in terms of cost per serving, that would be $4.00 divided by 15 servings, which is approximately $0.2667 per serving. Then, multiplying that by 60 servings would give the same result: 60 times 0.2667 is approximately $16.00. So, that checks out. 

So, whether I calculate the number of cartons first or the cost per serving, I still end up with the same total cost of $16.00. 

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be $16.00.

**Final Answer**
Cynthia will spend \boxed{16} dollars on ice cream after 60 days.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she needs 60 servings over 60 days. Each carton contains 15 servings, so she needs:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings per carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00 \text{ per carton} = \$16.00
\]

Thus, Cynthia will spend \boxed{16} dollars on ice cream after 60 days.
