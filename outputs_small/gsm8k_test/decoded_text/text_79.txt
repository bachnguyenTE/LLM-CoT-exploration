Q: John adopts a dog.  He takes the dog to the groomer, which costs $100.  The groomer offers him a 30% discount for being a new customer.  How much does the grooming cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the original cost of the grooming service, which is $100.

Next, calculate the discount by finding 30% of $100. This is done by multiplying 0.30 by 100, resulting in $30.

Finally, subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final amount the customer pays. So, $100 minus $30 equals $70.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the Original Cost:**
   
   The grooming service costs **\$100**.

2. **Calculate the Discount:**
   
   The groomer offers a **30% discount** for being a new customer.
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30\% \times \$100 = 0.30 \times 100 = \$30
   \]

3. **Find the Final Cost:**
   
   Subtract the discount from the original cost.
   
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = \$100 - \$30 = \$70
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$70}
\]
