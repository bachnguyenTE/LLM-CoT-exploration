Q: Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Pauline spent on visit to the museum. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Pauline visits the museum three times a year. That means every year, she goes 3 times. The cost of one visit is $2. So, normally, each year she spends 3 times $2, which is $6. But wait, the problem says that after 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. Hmm, that's a big increase. Let me make sure I understand what "increased by 150%" means.

I think when something increases by a percentage, it's the original amount plus that percentage. So, if the cost increases by 150%, that means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost. So, if the original cost is $2, then 150% of $2 is 0.30, right? Because 150% is 1.50 in decimal, so 1.50 * 2 = 3. So, the new cost is $2 + $3 = $5. So, each visit now costs $5.

Wait, let me double-check that. 150% increase on $2. So, 150% of 2 is 1.50 * 2 = 3. So, yes, the new cost is $5. That seems correct.

So, for the first 5 years, each visit is $5. But then, Pauline decided not to give up any visits and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. So, that means after 5 years, she went 5 times, and then she went 3 more times, making it 8 visits in total.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. The problem says she visits three times a year. So, each year, 3 visits. So, for 5 years, that's 5 * 3 = 15 visits. Then, she continued for 3 more years, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 visits. So, total visits would be 15 + 9 = 24 visits.

But wait, hold on. The problem says "after 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%." So, does that mean that the increase happened after 5 years, or is the increase applied to the original cost? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read it again: "The cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years."

So, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but she continued to go for 3 more years. So, does that mean that the increase happened at the time of the 5th year, or is the increase applied to the original cost?

Wait, maybe the increase happened after 5 years, so the cost is now $5, and she continues for 3 more years, so 3 visits. So, in total, 5 years * 3 visits = 15 visits, and then 3 more visits, so 18 visits in total.

Wait, but the problem says "after 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%." So, maybe the increase happened at the end of the 5th year, so the cost is now $5, and she continues for 3 more years, so 3 visits. So, total visits would be 5*3 + 3*3 = 15 + 9 = 24 visits.

But wait, let me think again. If the cost increased by 150%, does that mean that the cost is now 150% more than before? Or is it 150% of the original cost?

I think it's the former. So, if the original cost is $2, then 150% of $2 is $3, so the new cost is $5. So, the cost per visit is now $5.

So, for the first 5 years, she went 5 times a year, so 5*3=15 visits? Wait, no, 5 years, 3 visits each year, so 15 visits. Then, she continued for 3 more years, so 3*3=9 visits. So, total visits: 15 + 9=24.

So, each visit is $5, so total cost is 24 * $5 = $120.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says "the cost of one visit has increased by
