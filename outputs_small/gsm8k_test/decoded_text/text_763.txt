Q: Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rob, Royce, and Pedro who are contractors. They need to put on a new roof on three homes. The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. Hmm, wait, the question says 250 cases. Let me check that again. It says, "If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles..." Oh, okay, so 250 cases in total. Got it.

Now, the problem goes on: "the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first." So, I need to figure out how many cases each house needs. Specifically, the question is asking, "How many cases of shingles will the third house need?" So, I need to find the number for the third house.

Let me break this down. Let's denote the number of cases needed by the first house as, let's say, x. Then, the second house needs 1/2 of the second house, which is confusing. Wait, hold on. It says the first house needing 1/2 of the second. So, if the first house needs x cases, then the second house needs 2x cases? Because 1/2 of the second is x, so the second is 2x. Yeah, that makes sense.

And the third house needs double the first, so that would be 2x as well. Wait, hold on. So, first house is x, second is 2x, third is 2x. So, total cases would be x + 2x + 2x. Let me write that down:

Total cases = x (first house) + 2x (second house) + 2x (third house) = 250.

So, adding those up: x + 2x + 2x is 5x. So, 5x = 250. Therefore, x = 250 / 5 = 50. So, the first house needs 50 cases.

Then, the second house needs 2x, which is 2*50 = 100 cases.

The third house also needs 2x, which is another 100 cases.

Wait, so the first house is 50, the second is 100, the third is 100. Let me check if that adds up: 50 + 100 + 100 = 250. Yes, that's correct.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of of shingles.

But wait, let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. It says the first house needs 1/2 of the second. So, if the first house is x, then the second is 2x. So, that seems right. And the third is double the first, so 2x. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes these problems can be tricky with the wording. Let me read it again: "the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first." So, first is 1/2 of the second, so second is double the first. Third is double the first. So, yeah, that's how I interpreted it.

So, if first is x, second is 2x, third is 2x. So, total is 5x = 250, so x is 50. So, third house is 2x, which is 100. So, 100 cases.

Wait, but let me think again. If the first house is 50, the second is 100, and the third is 100, then 50 + 100 + 100 is 250. That's correct.

Alternatively, if I had misread it, maybe the first house is 1/2 of the third, but no, the problem says the first house needs 1/2 of the second. So, first is 1/2 of the second, so second is double the first. Third is double the first. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the first house is 1/2 of the second, so the second is double the first. Third is double the first. So, yeah, that's consistent.

So, I think my answer is correct. The third house needs 100 cases.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the first house is 1/2 of the second, so the second is double the first. Third is double the first. So, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, if the first house is 1/2 of the second, so second is 2x, and third is
