Q: A wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about a wall mural with four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The problem says that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Hmm, that means red, white, and purple each have the same quantity. Then it says half the mural is yellow. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. I need to find out how many pints of red paint were used.

Let me try to break this down. First, let's think about the colors. There are four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The problem states that red, white, and purple have equal amounts. So, if I let the amount of red paint be R, then white and purple would also each be R. Yellow is half the mural, so that's half of the total paint.

Wait, hold on. Is the half the amount of the paint or half the area? The problem says half the mural is yellow. So, if the total area is 100%, then half the area is yellow. But the total paint is 12 pints. So, maybe the amount of yellow paint is half of 12 pints? That would be 6 pints. Let me check that.

If half the mural is yellow, then the amount of yellow paint is half of the total paint. So, 12 pints total, half is 6 pints. So, yellow paint is 6 pints. Then, the remaining paint is red, white, and purple. Since red, white, and purple each have equal amounts, let me denote each of them as R. So, red is R, white is R, purple is R, and yellow is 6 pints.

So, the total paint is R + R + R + 6 = 3R + 6. And that's equal to 12 pints. So, 3R +6 =12. Let me write that equation down:

3R + 6 = 12

Now, I can solve for R. Subtract 6 from both sides:

3R = 12 -6
3R =6

Then, divide both sides by 3:

R =6 /3
R=2

So, each of red, white, and purple is 2 pints. Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

Wait, let me double-check. If red is 2 pints, white is 2, purple is 2, and yellow is 6, then total is 2+2+2+6=12. Wait, that's 12 pints? But the total is supposed to be 12 pints. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem. It says half the mural is yellow. So, is the amount of yellow paint half the total area, or half the total paint? The problem says "half the mural is yellow." So, half the area is yellow. But it also says "half the mural is yellow." So, if the total area is, say, A, then yellow is A/2. But the total paint is 12 pints. So, is the amount of yellow paint half the total paint? Or is it half the area?

Wait, the problem says "half the mural is yellow." So, that's half the area. But it also says "half the mural is yellow." So, if the total area is A, then yellow is A/2. But the total paint is 12 pints. So, is the amount of yellow paint half the total paint? Or is it half the area?

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "Half the mural is yellow." So, half the area is yellow. But it also says "half the mural is yellow." So, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's half the amount of paint? Or half the area?

Wait, the problem says "half the mural is yellow." So, that's half the area. But it also says "half the mural is yellow." So, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's half the amount of paint? Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If it's half the area, then the amount of paint would be half the area times the paint per unit area. But since all the colors are used in the same proportions, maybe the amount of paint is proportional to the area. So, if half the area is yellow, then half the paint is yellow. So, that would make sense.

So, if half the area is yellow, then half the paint is yellow. So, yellow is 6 pints, as I thought before. Then, the remaining 6 pints are red, white, and purple, each equal. So
