Q: Three of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4 inch heels and three are wearing 2 inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three women at a cocktail party wearing different pairs of heels. Let me try to figure out the average height of the heels. Hmm, the question says that three women are wearing 4-inch heels and three are wearing 2-inch heels. I need to find the average height of the heels at the party. 

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that average height is calculated by adding up all the heights and then dividing by the number of items. In this case, the items are the heels worn by the women. So, I need to find the total number of inches of heels and then divide that by the total number of women.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three women with 4-inch heels and three with 2-inch heels. So, each group has three women, right? So, in total, there are six women at the party. Each of the three women is wearing 4 inches, and each of the other three is wearing 2 inches. 

So, to find the average, I should calculate the total inches of heels and then divide by the number of women. Let me write that down step by step.

First, calculate the total inches for the 4-inch heels. There are three women, each wearing 4 inches, so that's 3 multiplied by 4. Let me do that: 3 * 4 = 12 inches. 

Next, calculate the total inches for the 2-inch heels. Similarly, there are three women, each wearing 2 inches, so that's 3 multiplied by 2. Let me compute that: 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Now, add those two totals together to get the overall total inches of heels. So, 12 inches (from the 4-inch heels) plus 6 inches (from the 2-inch heels) equals 18 inches. 

So, the total inches of heels at the party is 18 inches. Now, how many women are there in total? There are three women with 4-inch heels and three with 2-inch heels, so that's 3 + 3 = 6 women.

Now, to find the average height of the heels, I need to divide the total inches by the number of women. So, that's 18 inches divided by 6 women. Let me do that division: 18 ÷ 6 = 3. 

Wait, so the average height of the heels is 3 inches? That seems a bit low, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again: three women with 4-inch heels. 3 * 4 = 12 inches. Three women with 2-inch heels. 3 * 2 = 6 inches. Total inches: 12 + 6 = 18 inches. Total women: 3 + 3 = 6. 18 divided by 6 is indeed 3. Hmm, okay, so that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I have three 4-inch heels and three 2-inch heels, the average is somewhere between 2 and 4 inches. Since there are equal numbers of each, the average should be exactly in the middle. The middle between 2 and 4 is 3. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as each pair of women contributes 3 inches on average. So, 3 women with 4-inch heels and 3 with 2-inch heels, each pair averages 3 inches. So, yeah, 3 inches is the average.

Wait, another way to think about it is to consider the total number of inches. So, 3 women with 4-inch heels: each contributes 4, so 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 3 women with 2-inch heels: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. So, 12 + 6 = 18. 18 divided by 6 is 3. Yep, same result.

I think that's solid. So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches. 

But just to make sure, let me consider if the question is asking for something else. It says, "the average height of heels at this party." So, each person is wearing a pair of heels, so each woman is wearing one pair. So, each pair is either 4 inches or 2 inches. So, the average is of the pairs, not the individual heels. So, yeah, that's 3 inches.

Alternatively, if it were asking for the average number of heels, that would be different, but the question is about the average height of the heels, so it's the average of the pairs. So, 3 inches is correct.
