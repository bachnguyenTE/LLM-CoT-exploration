Q: Lori wants to buy a $320.00 pair of shoes and a matching belt that is $32.00.  Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour.  How many hours will she have to work before she can make her purchase?

Okay, so Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that costs $320.00 and a matching belt that's $32.00. Hmm, let me figure out how much she needs to spend in total. I think I should add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. So, $320.00 plus $32.00. Let me write that down: 320.00 + 32.00. 

Wait, adding those together... 320 plus 32 is 352. So, the total cost is $352.00. Okay, got that down. Now, Lori works part-time and gets paid $8.00 per hour. I need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00. 

Hmm, so this is a division problem, right? I need to divide the total amount she needs to spend by her hourly wage. So, that would be 352.00 divided by 8.00. Let me write that as a division: 352.00 ÷ 8.00. 

Wait, but dealing with decimals can be a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify this by converting the dollars into cents to eliminate the decimals. So, $352.00 is 35200 cents, and $8.00 is 800 cents. So, 35200 divided by 80. Hmm, that might be easier. 

Let me do that division: 35200 ÷ 80. I can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10, which gives me 3520 ÷ 8. Now, 3520 divided by 8. Let me see, 8 goes into 35 four times (since 8x4=32), remainder 2. Bring down the 2, making it 22. 8 goes into 22 two times (8x2=16), remainder 6. Bring down the 0, making it 60. 8 goes into 60 seven times (8x7=56), remainder 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 8 goes into 40 exactly 5 times. So, putting it all together, 3520 ÷ 8 is 440. 

Wait, so 35220 divided by 8 is 440. So, that means 35200 divided by 80 is 440. So, Lori needs to work 440 hours to earn $352.00. 

But wait, let me double-check that. If she works 440 hours at $8 per hour, that's 440 x 8. Let me compute that: 400 x8 is 3200, and 40x8 is 320, so 3200 + 320 is 3520. So, yes, that's correct. 

But wait, the total she needs is $352.00, not $3520.00. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me go back. 

Oh, I see. I converted the total amount to cents, which is 35200 cents, and her hourly wage to cents, which is 800 cents. So, 35200 ÷ 800. Let me try that division again. 

35200 ÷ 800. Hmm, 800 goes into 35200 how many times? Let me see, 800 x 40 is 35200. So, 800 x 44 is 35200. Wait, no, 800 x 44 is 35200? Let me check: 800 x 40 is 32000, and 800 x4 is 3200, so 32000 + 3200 is 35200. Yes, so 800 x44 is 35200. So, 35200 ÷800 is 44. So, that means she needs to work 44 hours. 

Wait, but earlier I thought 35200 ÷800 is 44. So, that's correct. So, 35200 ÷80 is 440,
