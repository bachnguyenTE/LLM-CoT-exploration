Q: It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?

Okay, so I have this problem here: James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. Then he reads 18 pages and decides to go to sleep. The question is asking how long James spends reading, in minutes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the rate at which James reads. The problem says he takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages. Wait, 10 minutes? Let me check that again. It says, "It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages..." Oh, okay, so 10 minutes for 3 pages. So, that means his reading speed is 3 pages per 10 minutes. Hmm, that seems a bit slow, but maybe it's a typo or something. Anyway, let's go with that.

So, if he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then how long does it take him to read 18 pages? Well, maybe I can find out how long it takes him to read one page and then multiply that by 18. That might be a good approach.

Let me calculate his reading rate. If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 1 page would take 10 minutes divided by 3 pages. So, 10 divided by 3 is... let me do that division. 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333... minutes per page. So, about 3 and a third minutes per page.

Now, if he reads 18 pages, then the total time would be 18 pages multiplied by 3.333 minutes per page. Let me compute that. 18 times 3 is 54, and 18 times 0.333 is... 18 times 0.333 is approximately 6. So, 54 plus 6 is 60 minutes. So, 60 minutes in total.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages. Since 18 divided by 3 is 6, that means he reads 6 sets of 3 pages. Each set takes 10 minutes, so 6 times 10 is 60 minutes. Yeah, that also gives me 60 minutes. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up a proportion. If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages would take how many minutes? Wait, no, he reads 18 pages, so that's double the number of pages. So, 10 minutes times 2 is 20 minutes. But wait, that's only 18 pages? Wait, no, 3 pages take 10 minutes, so 6 pages would take 20 minutes, and 9 pages would take 30 minutes. So, 18 pages would be 40 minutes. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then 18 pages would take how much? So, 18 pages is 6 times 3 pages. So, 6 times 10 minutes is 60 minutes. So, that's consistent with the previous answer.

But in the proportion approach, if I set up 3 pages over 10 minutes equals 18 pages over x minutes, that would be 3/10 = 18/x. Solving for x, cross-multiplying, 3x = 10*18, so 3x = 180, so x = 60. So, that's 60 minutes. So, that's consistent.

Wait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought 18 pages is 6 times 3 pages, so 6 times 10 minutes is 60 minutes. So, that's correct. So, both methods give me 60 minutes.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the time per page. So, 3 pages take 10 minutes, so 1 page is 10/3 minutes, which is approximately 3.333 minutes. So, 18 pages would be 18*(10/3) minutes. 18 divided by 3 is 6, so 6*10 is 60 minutes. So, that's consistent as well.

So, all these different methods are giving me the same answer, 60 minutes. So, that seems pretty solid.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the initial statement again. It says
