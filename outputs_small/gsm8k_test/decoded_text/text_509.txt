Q: Sophia and Rose went together to the market to buy onions and potatoes. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many onions and potatoes Rose bought. According to the problem, Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Next, I know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. To find out how many Sophia bought, I'll divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4.

For the onions: 12 divided by 4 equals 3.
For the potatoes: 4 divided by 4 equals 1.

Finally, I'll add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought together to find the total.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:**
   
   - **Onions:** Rose bought **12** onions.
   - **Potatoes:** Rose bought **4** potatoes.

2. **Understand the relationship between what Rose bought and what Sophia bought:**
   
   - Rose bought **4 times** the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
   - This means:
     \[
     \text{Onions bought by Rose} = 4 \times \text{Onions bought by Sophia}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Potatoes bought by Rose} = 4 \times \text{Potatoes bought by Sophia}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:**
   
   - **Onions:**
     \[
     \text{Onions bought by Sophia} = \frac{\text{Onions bought by Rose}}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   
   - **Potatoes:**
     \[
     \text{Potatoes bought by Sophia} = \frac{\text{Potatoes bought by Rose}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]

4. **Find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Onions} + \text{Potatoes} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
