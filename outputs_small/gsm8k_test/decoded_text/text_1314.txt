A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about John, his son James, and his youngest son. I need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the information given:

1. John had a son James when he was 19. So, that means when James was born, John was 19 years old. So, if I can figure out how old John is now, I can find out how old James is now.

2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. So, Dora will be 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. Therefore, James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.

3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. So, if I can figure out how old John is now, I can subtract 32 to find out how old his youngest son is now, and then add 3 to find out how old he will be in 3 years.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So, John had a son James when he was 19, so that means when James was born, John was 19. So, if I can find out how old John is now, that would be 19 plus the number of years since James was born. But I don't know how many years have passed since then. Hmm, maybe I need to find John's current age first.

Let me think. Since James is 18 now, and he was born when John was 19, that means John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now. Wait, is that right? Because if James is 18 now, and he was born when John was 19, then the difference in their ages is 1 year. So, John is 19 + 18 = 37? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, if James is 18 now, and he was born when John was 19, then John is 19 + 18 = 27 years old now. Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. If John had a son James when he was 19, that means when James was born, John was 19. So, the age difference between John and James is 19 years. So, if James is 18 now, then John is 18 + 19 = 37 years old now. That makes sense because 18 + 19 = 37. So, John is 37 now.

Wait, let me verify that. If James is 18 now, and he was born when John was 19, then the age difference is 1 year. So, John is 19 + 18 = 37. Yes, that seems correct.

So, John is 37 now. His youngest son was born when John was 32. So, how old was John when his youngest son was born? That would be 37 - 32 = 5 years old. So, his youngest son is 5 years old now.

Therefore, in 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old. So, the answer should be 8.

Wait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. John had a son James when he was 19. So, when James was born, John was 19.

2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. So, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, James is 18 now.

3. So, since James is 18 now and he was born when John was 19, the age difference is 18 - 19 = -1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not right. If James is 18 now and he was born when John was 19, then John is 19 + 18 = 37 now. So, that's correct.

4. So, John is 37 now. His youngest son was born when John was 32. So, 37 - 32 = 5. So, his youngest son is 5 now.

5. Therefore, in 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8.

Wait, that seems consistent. So, the
