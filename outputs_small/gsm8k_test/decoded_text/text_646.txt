Q: Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. How many miles did Alisa and Stanley bike in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Alisa and Stanley are biking, and I need to figure out how many miles they biked in total. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Hmm, okay, so that's a speed multiplied by time, which should give me the distance she covered. I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, so the formula is d = s * t. So, for Alisa, her speed is 12 mph, and she biked for 4.5 hours. So, I can calculate her distance by multiplying 12 by 4.5. Let me write that down: 12 * 4.5. 

Wait, what's 12 times 4.5? Let me think. 12 times 4 is 48, and 12 times 0.5 is 6, so adding those together, 48 + 6 is 54. So, Alisa biked 54 miles. That seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to Stanley. The problem states that Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Wait, hold on, the problem says 10, but in the original problem statement, it was 10 miles per hour. Let me check the problem again. It says Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. So, yeah, 10 is correct. So, his speed is 10 mph? Wait, no, 10 is 10, right? So, 10 mph. So, his speed is 10 mph, and he biked for 2.5 hours. So, again, distance equals speed multiplied by time, so 10 * 2.5. 

Calculating that, 10 times 2 is 20, and 10 times 0.5 is 5, so 20 + 5 is 25. So, Stanley biked 25 miles. 

Now, the question is asking for the total miles that both Alisa and Stanley biked. So, I need add the distance Alisa biked to the distance Stanley biked. So, that's 54 miles plus 25 miles. Let me add those together. 54 + 25. Hmm, 54 plus 20 is 74, and then plus 5 is 79. So, the total distance is 79 miles.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

For Alisa: 12 mph * 4.5 hours. 12 * 4 is 48, 12 * 0.5 is 6, so 48 + 6 is 54. That seems right. 

For Stanley: 10 mph * 2.5 hours. 10 * 2 is 20, 10 * 0.5 is 5, so 20 + 5 is 25. That also seems correct. 

Adding them together: 54 + 25. 54 + 25 is 79. Yeah, that's correct. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the total miles they biked together is 79 miles.

**Final Answer**
The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is \boxed{79}.
</think>

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Using the formula for distance, \( d = s \times t \), we calculate:

\[
12 \,54 \text{ miles}
\]

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, we calculate:

\[
10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley together:

\[
54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles}
\]

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is \boxed{79}.
