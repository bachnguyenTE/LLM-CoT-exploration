Q: Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml of water does she need to drink?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of calories Hannah burns during her aerobics and running exercises.

She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, burning 500 calories per hour. So, the calories burned during aerobics are 2 hours multiplied by 500 calories/hour, which equals 1000 calories.

Next, she spends 1 hour running, burning 600 calories per hour. Therefore, the calories burned during running are 1 hour multiplied by600 calories/hour, totaling 600 calories.

Adding these together, the total calories burned are 1000 calories plus 600 calories, which equals 1600 calories.

According to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1660 calories, I can set up a proportion.

Let x be the amount of water she needs to drink. The proportion is:

100 ml / 220 calories = x ml / 1660 calories

Solving for x, I multiply both sides by 1660 calories:

x = (100 ml * 1660 calories) / 220 calories

Calculating this gives x = 769.09 ml.

Since she can't drink a fraction of a milliliter, I'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 770 ml.

To determine how many milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Calories Burned:**
   
   - **Aerobics:**
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
     \]
   
   - **Running:**
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
     \]
   
   - **Total Calories Burned:**
     \[
     1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Determine Water Intake Based on Calories Burned:**
   
   - **Given Ratio:**
     \[
     100 \text{ ml of water} \text{ per } 220 \text{ calories}
     \]
   
   - **Set Up the Proportion:**
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{220 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
     \]
   
   - **Solve for \( x \):**
     \[
     x = \frac{100 \times 1600}{220} = \frac{160000}{220} \approx 727.27 \text{ ml}
     \]
   
   - **Since Hannah can't drink a fraction of a milliliter, round up to the nearest whole number:**
     \[
     x \approx 728 \text{ ml}
     \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{728}
   \]
