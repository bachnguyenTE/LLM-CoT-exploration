First, I need to determine Charmaine's current age. The problem states that she will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find her current age, I subtract 12 from 16.

**Solution:**

Let's determine Charmaine's current age and then find out how old she will be in 4 years.

1. **Determine Charmaine's current age:**

   - Charmaine will be **16 years old** in **12 years**.
   - To find her current age, subtract 12 from 16:
     
     \[
     \text{Current Age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine her age 4 years from now:**

   - Charmaine is currently **4 years old**.
   - In **4 years**, she will be:
     
     \[
     4 + 4 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
