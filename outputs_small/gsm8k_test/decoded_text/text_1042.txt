Q: Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Johnny and his dad betting on horse racing. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. That's straightforward. So, the loss on the first race is -$5. 

Moving on to the second race, it says he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Hmm, so the previous loss was $5, right? So twice that would be 2 times $5, which is $10. Then he won $1 more than that. So, $10 plus $1 is $11. So, on the second race, he won $11. 

Now, the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he won $11 on the second race, so 1.5 times that would be 1.5 times $11. Let me calculate that. 1.5 times 10 is 15, and 1.5 times 1 is 1.5, so total is 15 + 1.5 = $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race. 

Wait, hold on, is that right? 1.5 times $11 is $16.50? Let me double-check. 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so 3/2 times 11 is 3/2 times 11, which is 3/2, which is 1.5. So, 1.5 times 11 is indeed 1.5. So, yes, $1.50. So, he lost $1.50 on the third race. 

So, now, we need to find out how much he lost on average that day. So, we need to calculate the average loss per race. 

He lost $5 on the first race, won $11 on the second race, and lost $1.50 on the third race. So, the total amount he lost is $5 plus $1.50, which is $6.50. 

Wait, but he also won some money, so does that affect the average loss? Hmm, the question is asking how much he lost on average that day. So, I think we just need to consider the total amount he lost across all races and then divide by the number of races. 

So, he lost $5, $0 (since he didn't lose any on the second race), and $1.50 on the third race. So, total loss is $5 + $0 + $1.50 = $6.50. 

He participated in three races, so the average loss per race is total loss divided by number of races. So, that's $6.50 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 

6.50 divided by 3. Well, 3 goes into 6 twice, so 2. Then, 3 goes into 0.50 how many times? 3 goes into 0 zero times, and 3 goes into 5 once with a remainder of 2. So, 0.50 divided by 3 is approximately 0.1666... So, adding that to the 2, we get approximately 2.1666... So, about $2.17.

But let me write that as a fraction. 6.50 is the same as 650 cents, so 650 divided by 3. Let me do the division: 3 into 6 is 2, 3 into 5 is 1 with 2 remainder, 3 into 20 is 6 with 2 remainder. So, 2.1666... So, as a fraction, that's 2 and 1/6, which is approximately 2.1666... So, in dollars, that's $2.17 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the total loss. So, first race: $5 loss. Second race: he won $11, so no loss. Third race: he lost 1.5 times the second race's win, which is 1.5 times $11, which is $1.50. So, total loss is $5 + $0 + $1.50 = $6.50. So, that's correct.

So, average loss per race is $6.50 divided by 3 races. So, 6.50 / 3. Let me compute that more accurately. 3 into 6 is
