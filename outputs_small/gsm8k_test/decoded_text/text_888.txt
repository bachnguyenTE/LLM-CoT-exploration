Q: Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 five cookies and placed the rest equally into five jars. How many cookies were in each jar?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Lani baked a total of 55 cookies.

She ate 5 of them, so the remaining cookies are 55 minus 5, which equals 50.

These 50 cookies are equally divided into 5 jars.

To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide 50 by 5, resulting in 10 cookies per jar.
</think>

**Solution:**

Lani baked a total of **55** cookies.

1. **Cookies Eaten:**
   - Lani ate **5** cookies.
   - Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies eaten
   - Remaining cookies = 55 - 5 = **50**

2. **Cookies in Jars:**
   - The remaining **50** cookies are equally placed into **5** jars.
   - Cookies per jar = Remaining cookies ÷ Number of jars
   - Cookies per jar = 50 ÷ 5 = **10**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{10}
