Q: On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.

Okay, so I have this problem here about a tow truck pulling cars over the course of a week. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that on a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days. I need to calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me break down the information given. The tow truck did ten cars each day for the first three days. Then, for the remaining days, it pulled four fewer cars each day. I need to figure out how many days are left after the first three days in a week. Well, a week has seven days, right? So, if the first three days are done, that leaves four more days. So, the tow truck pulled ten cars each day for three days and then six cars each day for the next four days. Wait, hold on, the problem says four fewer cars each of the remaining days. So, if it was ten cars on the first three days, then on the remaining days, it's ten minus four, which is six cars each day.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. So, for the first three days: 10 cars/day. For the next four days: 6 cars/day. So, total cars towed would be the sum of cars towed each day.

So, let me calculate the total for the first three days. That would be 10 cars/day multiplied by 3 days. 10 times 3 is 30 cars. Okay, that's straightforward.

Now, for the remaining four days, it's 6 cars/day. So, 6 times 4 is 24 cars. So, 24 cars for the last four days.

Now, to find the total number of cars towed that week, I need to add the cars from the first three days and the cars from the remaining four days. So, 30 cars plus 24 cars. Let me add those together. 30 plus 24 is 54. So, the total number of cars towed that week is 54.

Wait, let me double-check that. First three days: 10 each day, so 10 + 10 +10 is 30. Then, the next four days: 6 each day, so 6 +6 +6 +6 is 24. 30 +24 is indeed 54. Hmm, that seems right.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. It says "four fewer cars on each of the remaining days." So, if the first three days were ten cars, then each of the remaining days is ten minus four, which is six. So, that's correct. So, 6 cars per day for four days is 24. So, 30 plus 24 is 54. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as an arithmetic sequence or something. The number of cars each day is decreasing by four each day. So, starting from ten, then six, then two, then negative two, then negative six, then negative ten. Wait, but in a week, you can't have negative cars towed, right? So, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, no, actually, the problem doesn't specify that the number of cars can't be negative. It just says four fewer cars each day. So, if on the fourth day, it's ten minus four, which is six, then fifth day is six minus four, which is two, sixth day is two minus four, which is negative two, and seventh day is negative six. But negative cars don't make sense, so maybe the problem is only considering the first three days and the remaining days, regardless of whether the number of cars is positive or not.

So, in that case, the total is still 30 plus 24, which is 54. So, I think that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as an arithmetic series. The number of cars each day is 10, 10, 10, 6,6,6,6. So, the first three terms are 10, the next four terms are 6. So, the total is 3*10 + 4*6, which is 30 +24, which is 54. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total as 10*3 +6*4, which is 30 +24, which is 54. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total as 10*7 -4*4. Wait, why? Because
