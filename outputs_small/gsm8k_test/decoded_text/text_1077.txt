Q: Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?

Okay, so I need to figure out how long Paul has to wait for his train. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let's list out all the information given:

1. **First train:**
   - Schedules to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second train:**
   - Arrives half an hour (which is 30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed. So, a quarter of 20 minutes is... let me calculate that. 20 divided by 4 is 5 minutes. So, the second train stays for 5 minutes.

3. **Third train:**
   - Arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it arrives and departs at the same time.

4. **Fourth train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Alright, so I need to figure out the arrival times of each train and then determine when Paul can board his train. Since Paul is waiting for his fourth train, I need to find out when the fourth train arrives.

Let me start by figuring out the schedule for each train.

**First Train:**
- Arrives in 10 minutes.
- Stays for 20 minutes.
- So, if I assume the first train arrives at time 0, it will be at the station from 0 to 10 minutes.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I should assign a specific time to when the first train arrives. Let me assume that the first train arrives at time 0. Then, it stays for 20 minutes, so it leaves at 10 minutes.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify when Paul is at the station. It just says he's waiting for his train. So maybe I need to figure out the arrival times based on when each train arrives.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the timeline with each train's arrival and departure times.

Let me try to map out the timeline.

Let me denote the arrival time of the first train as T1.

- T1 arrives at 0 minutes.
- It stays for 20 minutes, so it leaves at 20 minutes.

But wait, the problem says the first train arrives in 10 minutes. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes. So, if I set the first train's arrival time as 0, it arrives at 0 minutes, and stays for 20 minutes, so it leaves at 20 minutes.

But then, the second train arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves. So, the first train leaves at 20 minutes, so the second train arrives at 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.

The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so a quarter is 5 minutes. So, the second train stays for 5 minutes, so it leaves at 50 +5 = 55 minutes.

Wait, that seems a bit short. Let me check.

Wait, the first train arrives at 0 minutes, stays until 20 minutes. So, it arrives at 0, departs at 20.

Second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves. The first train leaves at 20, so second train arrives at 22 + 30 = 55 minutes? Wait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the first train arrives at 0, stays until 20. So, it leaves at 22. Then, the second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves. So, first train leaves at 22, so second train arrives at 22 + 30 = 55 minutes.

Then, the second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so a quarter is 5 minutes. So, the second train departs at 55 +5 = 60 minutes.

Third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves. The second train leaves at 60, so third train arrives at 60 +600 = 120 minutes? Wait, that seems too long.

Wait, no. Let me parse the problem again.

"The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station."

So, the first train arrives at 0, stays
