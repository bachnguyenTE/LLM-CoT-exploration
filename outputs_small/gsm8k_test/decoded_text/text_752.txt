Q: Jenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total annual electricity bill. Since the monthly bill is $100, multiplying this by 12 months gives the annual total.

Next, I'll divide the annual bill by the number of roommates, which is 4, to find out how much each roommate pays per year.

Finally, I'll present the final answer.

**Solution:**

To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual electricity bill:**
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Bill} = \text{Monthly Bill} \times \text{Number of Months in a Year}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Bill} = \$100 \times 12 = \$1200
   \]

2. **Divide the annual bill equally among the 4 roommates:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount per Roommate} = \frac{\text{Annual Bill}}{\text{Number of Roommates}}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Amount per Roommate} = \frac{\$1200}{4} = \$300
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$300}
\]
