Q: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Comet Halley and Bill's dad and Bill's ages. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. That's a pretty long period, so I guess it's a long-period comet. Now, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, when his dad saw the comet, he was 30. Then, it says Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the first time. So, I need to figure out how old Bill was when he saw the first comet.

Let me try to structure this. Let me denote some variables to make it clearer.

Let me let D be the age of Bill's dad when he saw the first comet. The problem says that D is 30. So, D = 30.

Now, when Bill saw the second comet, his age was three times the age his dad was when he saw the first comet. So, if I let B be Bill's age when he saw the second comet, then B = 3 * D. Since D is 30, then B = 3 * 30 = 90. So, Bill was 90 years old when he saw the second comet.

Now, the key here is to figure out the time between the first and second comet. Since the comet orbits every 75 years, the time between the two sightings should be 75 years. So, the time between the first and second sighting is 75 years.

So, the age difference between Bill's dad and Bill is 75 years. Because the time between the two sightings is 75 years, and the age difference remains constant unless Bill is aging faster, but I think in this context, the age difference is fixed because both Bill and his dad are aging at the same rate.

Wait, hold on. Is the age difference fixed? Let me think. If the comet orbits every 75 years, that means the time between two perihelions (the closest point in the orbit) is 75 years. So, the time between two sightings is 75 years. So, the age difference between Bill and his dad should be 75 years.

But wait, when the dad saw the comet, he was 30, and when Bill saw it, he was 90. So, the age difference is 90 - 30 = 60 years. Hmm, that's a 60-year difference, but the orbital period is 75 years. That seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

"Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?"

So, the key is that the age difference between Bill and his dad is constant. So, when the dad was 30, Bill was 30 + x, where x is the age difference. Then, when Bill saw the second time, he was 3 * 30 = 90. So, 90 = 30 + x + 60? Wait, that might not be the right way.

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote the age difference as x. So, when the dad was 30, Bill was 30 + x. Then, when Bill saw the second time, he was 3 * 30 = 90. So, 90 = (30 + x) + x. Because the age difference remains the same. So, 90 = 30 + 2x. Then, 2x = 90 - 30 = 60, so x = 33. So, the age difference is 33 years.

So, when the dad was 30, Bill was 30 + 33 = 63. Then, when Bill saw the second time, he was 90, which is 3 times 30. So, that makes sense.

But then, the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, the age difference is 33, and the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, the age difference is 33, which is the same as the age difference between Bill and his dad.

Wait, but 33 is the age difference, and the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, that seems inconsistent because 33 is not equal to 75. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the age difference with the time between
