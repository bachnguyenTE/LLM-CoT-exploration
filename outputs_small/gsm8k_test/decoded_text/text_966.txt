Q: Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?

Okay, so Greta made some brownies for her birthday. Let me try to figure out how many she has left after all the events. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. A dozen is 12, so that's 12 brownies. Got that.

Then, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with half a dozen brownies. Half a dozen is 6, right? So she got 6 more brownies. So now, how many does she have? Let me add that to the original. 12 + 6 is 18. So she has 18 brownies after the party.

Wait, but then when she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting. Hmm, 4 dozen is 4 times 12, which is 48. So, 48 brownies were waiting. So, does that mean she had 48 brownies before any were eaten? Or does she have 48 after the previous events?

Wait, let me read that again. "When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting." So, she had 48 brownies waiting. So, that's 48.

Then, during the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is 1.5 times 12, which is 18. So, 18 brownies were eaten.

So, let's see. She started with 48, then she got 6 more from the office, so 48 + 6 is 54. Then, she ate 18 during the party. So, 54 - 18 is 36. So, 36 brownies left.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. So, the initial 12, then 6 more, then 48, then 18 eaten. So, 12 + 6 is 8, plus 48 is 56, minus 18 is 38? Wait, that's conflicting with my previous answer.

Wait, maybe I misread the initial part. Let me read the problem again.

"Greta wanted brownies for her birthday. She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?"

So, step by step:

1. She made 1 dozen (12) brownies.

2. At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.

3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen (48) waiting.

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) were eaten.

So, let's model this.

She started with 12.

Then, she received 6 more, so 12 + 6 = 18.

Then, she had 48 waiting, so total brownies she had is 18 + 48 = 66.

Then, during the party, 18 were eaten, so 66 - 18 = 48.

Wait, that's 48. But that seems high. Let me check.

Wait, maybe the 48 is the total she had before the party, and then she ate 18, so 48 - 18 = 30. But that doesn't make sense because she had 18 from the office and 48 from her friends, so 66 total.

Wait, maybe I need to think of it as she had 12 from herself, then 6 from the office, so 18, and then 48 from her friends. So, 18 + 48 = 66. Then, 18 were eaten, so 66 - 18 = 48.

But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the 48 is the total she had, and then she ate 18, so 48 - 8 = 40. But that doesn't align with the previous numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it as:

Total brownies made: 12.

Then, she received 6 more, so 12 + 6 = 18
