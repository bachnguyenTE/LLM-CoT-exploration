Q: Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in "rabbit" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?

Okay, so Chris has this two-speed lawn mower that can mow his entire lawn in turtle mode in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, and in rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. The question is, how many minutes did it take him to mow the entire lawn?

Hmm, let me think about this. So, first, I need to figure out the rates at which Chris's lawn mower works in turtle and rabbit modes. Then, since he's mowing half the lawn in each mode, I can calculate the time taken for each half and add them together to get the total time.

Alright, let's start by finding the mowing rates. In turtle mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes. So, his rate in turtle mode is 1 lawn per 60 minutes, or 1/60 lawns per minute. Similarly, in rabbit mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is 1/40 lawns per minute.

Now, he's mowing half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. So, for each half, we can calculate the time taken.

Let me denote the total area of the lawn as 1 (for simplicity). Then, half the lawn is 0.5.

First, mowing half the lawn in turtle mode. His rate is 1/60 per minute, so the time taken for half the lawn would be (0.5) / (1/60). Let me compute that.

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes. So, 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.

Similarly, mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode. His rate is 1/40 per minute, so the time taken is (0.5) / (1/40) = 0.5 *40 = 20 minutes. So, 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Therefore, the total time is 30 +20 =50 minutes.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe I should think about it in terms of work rates.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total work as mowing the entire lawn, which is 1 unit. He's mowing half of it in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. So, the time taken would be the sum of the time taken for each half.

But wait, is there a way to combine the rates? Maybe not, because he's switching modes, so the rates are additive in terms of work done per minute.

Wait, actually, no. Because in each half, he's using a different mode, so the rates are additive. So, the total rate when mowing half the lawn in turtle and half in rabbit is (1/60 +1/40) lawns per minute.

Let me compute that. 1/60 is approximately 0.016667, and 1/40 is 0.025. Adding them together gives 0.041667 lawns per minute. So, the total rate is 0.041667 lawns per minute.

Therefore, the time taken to mow the entire lawn would be 1 / 0.041667. Let me compute that.

1 divided by 0.041667 is approximately 24 minutes. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous answer of 50 minutes. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if he's mowing half the lawn in turtle and half in rabbit, the total time should be the sum of the times for each half, not the reciprocal of the combined rate.

Wait, so maybe I confused the approach. Let me clarify.

If he's mowing half the lawn in turtle mode, which takes 30 minutes, and half in rabbit mode, which takes 20 minutes, then total time is 30 +20=50 minutes.

Alternatively, if I think of the total work as 1, and he's mowing 0.5 in turtle and 0.5 in rabbit, then the time is 0.5 / (1/60) + 0.5 / (1/40) = 30 +20=50 minutes.

So, that seems consistent.

But when I thought of the combined rate, I was mistakenly thinking of the total rate, but actually, the total time is the sum of the times for each half.

So, the correct total time is 30
