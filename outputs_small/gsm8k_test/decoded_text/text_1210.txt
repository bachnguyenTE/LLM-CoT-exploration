Okay, so Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends during the summer. They start off by filling up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. Hmm, wait, 30 balloons per pack? That seems like a lot, but okay, maybe it's a big pack. Anyway, by the end of the afternoon, they have 12 balloons left. The question is asking how many balloons they threw. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, they filled up 10 packs, each with 30 balloons. So, to find out the total number of balloons they started with, I need to multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack. That would be 10 times 30. Let me write that out: 10 * 30. Hmm, 10 times 30 is... 10 multiplied by 30. Well, 10 times 30 is 330. So, they started with 330 balloons.

Then, by the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. So, to find out how many balloons they threw, I need to subtract the number of balloons left from the total number they started with. That would be 330 minus 12. Let me do that subtraction: 330 - 12. 330 minus 10 is 321, and then minus 2 more is 319. So, 330 - 12 equals 319. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 10 packs times 30 balloons each is 300 balloons, right? 10 times 30 is 330. Then, 330 minus 12 is 319. Yeah, that seems right. So, they threw 319 balloons.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up. So, 10 packs, each with 30 balloons. 10 times 30 is 330. That's correct because 10 times any number is just that number with a zero at the end. So, 30 times 10 is 300, plus another 30 is 330. Yeah, that's right.

Then, they have 12 balloons left. So, 330 minus 12 is 319. Wait, 330 minus 10 is 320, and then minus 2 more is 318. Wait, hold on, that's different. Did I do that right? Wait, 330 minus 12 is 318? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because 330 minus 10 is 320, and then minus 2 is 318. But earlier I thought it was 319. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me do it step by step. 330 minus 12. So, starting from 330, subtract 10 to get to 320, and then subtract 2 more to get to 318. So, 330 minus 12 is 318, not 319. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 319. It's actually 318. So, the correct number of balloons thrown is 318.

Wait, but let me think again. 10 packs, each with 30 balloons. So, 10 times 30 is 330. Then, 330 minus 12 is 318. So, 318 is the correct number. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial calculation when I thought it was 319. So, 318 is the right answer.

So, to recap: They started with 330 balloons, ended with 12 left, so 330 minus 12 is 318. Therefore, they threw 318 balloons.

Wait, but let me make sure that 10 times 30 is 330. 10 times 30 is 330. Yes, because 10 times 30 is 330. So, that's correct. Then, 330 minus 12 is 318. So, yeah, 318 is the correct number.

So, the answer should be 318. So, they threw
