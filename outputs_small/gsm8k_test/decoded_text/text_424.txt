Q: The employees of Google went on a day trip. 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees, and 10 minivans that can hold 15 employees. How many employees can join the day trip?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about employees going on a day trip, and I need to figure out how many employees can join. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says that Google sent employees on a day trip. They rented 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees. Then, 6 minibusses, each holding 30 employees. And finally, 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees. The question is asking how many employees can join the day trip. Hmm, okay.

So, I think I need to calculate the total capacity by adding up all the buses, minibusses, and minivans. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the buses. There are 4 buses, each can hold 60 employees. So, to find the total capacity for the buses, I should multiply the number of buses by the capacity of each bus. That would be 4 times 60. Let me write that down:

4 buses * 60 employees per bus = ?

Hmm, 4 times 60. Let me calculate that. 4 times 60 is the same as 4*60. 4*60 is 240. So, the buses can hold 240 employees in total.

Okay, moving on to the minibusses. There are 6 of them, each holding 30 employees. So, similar to the buses, I need to multiply the number of minibusses by their capacity. That would be 6 * 30.

Calculating that: 6*30 is 180. So, the minibusses can hold 180 employees in total.

Now, the minivans. There are 10 minivans, each can hold 15 employees. So, I need to multiply 10 by 15. Let me do that: 10*15 is 150. So, the minivans can hold 150 employees in total.

Alright, now I have the capacities for each type of vehicle: 240 for buses, 180 for minibusses, and 150 for minivans. To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, I need to add all these capacities together.

So, let me add them up step by step. First, add the buses and the minibusses: 240 + 180. Hmm, 240 + 80 is 320. Then, add the minivans: 320 + 150. That should be 470. Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 240 + 180 is 420, right? Because 200 + 100 is 300, and 40 +80 is 120, so 300 +120 is 420. Then, adding 150 to 420: 420 +150 is 570. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 240 +180 is 420, and 420 +150 is 570. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 470. Maybe I made a mistake in adding.

Wait, let me do it again. 240 (buses) + 180 (minibusses) = 420. Then, 420 +150 (minivans) = 570. So, that's 570. Hmm, okay, so 570 is the total capacity.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial multiplication. Let me recalculate each part.

First, 4 buses *60 employees. 4*60: 4*60 is 240. That seems right.

Next, 6 minibusses *30 employees. 6*30 is 180. That's correct.

Then, 10 minivans *15 employees. 10*15 is 150. That's correct too.

So, adding them up: 240 +180 +150.

Let me add 240 +180 first. 240 +180: 200 +100 is 310, 40 +80 is 124, so 311 +124 is 435? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 240 +180 is 320, and then +10
