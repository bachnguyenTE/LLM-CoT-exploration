Q: 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race.  60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.  The rest of the people think horse #12 will win the big race.  How many people think that horse #12 will win?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about percentages of people thinking different horses will win a race. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says: 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. Hmm, okay, so that's straightforward. I can calculate how many people that is by multiplying 20% by 50. Let me write that down:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 11 people.

So, 11 people think horse #2 will win. Got that.

Next, it says 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. Hmm, so after the 11 people who thought horse #2 won, there are some remaining people. I need to figure out how many people are left after subtracting those 11 from the total of 50.

Wait, hold on. Is the total number of people 50? Or is it 50? Let me check the problem again. It says, "20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win." So, the total number of people is 50. So, after 11 people, the remaining people would be 50 - 11 = 44 people.

So, 60% of these remaining 44 people think horse #7 will win. Let me calculate that:

60% of 44 = 0.60 * 44 = 26.4 people.

Wait, hold on. That can't be right. You can't have a fraction of a person. So, 26.4 people? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Let me read it again: "20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win."

Hmm, so maybe the total number of people is 50, and after 11 people, 44 remain. Then 60% of 44 is 26.4, which is still a fraction. That doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a person. So, perhaps I need to consider that the percentages are of the remaining people, but maybe the total number is 100? Wait, no, the problem says 20% of 50 people, so 50 is the total.

Wait, maybe the percentages are of the total number of people, not the remaining. Let me check the problem again.

It says: "20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win." So, that's 20% of 50, which is 11 people. Then, "60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win." So, the remaining people after 11 is 50 - 11 = 39 people. So, 60% of 39 is 23.4. Hmm, still a fraction. That's not possible.

Wait, maybe the percentages are of the total number of people, not the remaining. Let me see: 20% of 50 is 11, and 60% of 50 is 30. So, 11 + 30 = 41 people. Then, the rest would be 50 - 41 = 9 people. So, 9 people think horse #12 will win.

But the problem says "the remaining people," which might imply that after the first group, the rest. So, maybe the percentages are of the remaining people after the first group. So, 20% of 50 is 11, then 60% of 44 is 26.4, which is not possible. So, maybe the problem is that the percentages are of the total, not the remaining.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win."

So, the first group is 20% of 50, which is 11. Then, the remaining people are 55 -11=44. Then, 60% of 44 is 26.4, which is not possible. So, maybe the percentages are of the total, not the remaining. So, 20% of 55 is 11, and 60% of 55 is 36. So, 11 +36=47,
