Q: Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Okay, so Elly has a bunch of books and she wants to organize them on new bookcases. Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Hmm, so there are two middle shelves. Then, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since a middle shelf holds 10, twice that would be 20 books. Got that. And the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So if the bottom holds 20, subtract 5, that would be 15 books on the top shelf. 

Let me write that down to make sure I got it right. Middle shelves: 2 shelves, each holding 10 books. Bottom shelf: twice as much as a middle shelf, so 2*10=20. Top shelf: 5 fewer than the bottom, so 20-5=15. Wait, 20-5 is 15? That seems a bit low, but okay, maybe it's correct. Let me double-check: 2 middle shelves at 10 each is 20 books. Bottom is twice that, so 20, and top is 5 less than bottom, so 15. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, let's add up all the books the shelves can hold. So, middle shelves: 2 shelves * 10 books each = 20 books. Bottom shelf: 20 books. Top shelf: 15 books. So total capacity is 20 + 20 + 15. Let me add those up: 20 + 20 is 40, and 40 +15 is 55. So total capacity is 55 books.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. If each middle shelf holds 10, two of them would be 20. The bottom holds twice as much as a middle shelf, so 20. The top holds 5 fewer than the bottom, so 15. So 20 + 20 +15 is 55. Hmm, okay, that's correct. So total capacity is 55 books.

But Elly has 110 books. So, 110 books divided by 55 books per case. Let me calculate that: 110 /55=2. So, 2 bookcases? Wait, that seems low. Because each bookcase can hold 55 books, so 2 bookcases can hold 110 books. But wait, each bookcase is a single unit, right? So if she has 2 bookcases, each can hold 55 books, so 2*55=110. So, yes, 2 bookcases.

But wait, hold on, is that correct? Because each shelf is a single unit, so each bookcase has multiple shelves. Wait, the question says "how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?" So, each bookcase has multiple shelves, each holding a certain number of books. So, each bookcase can hold 20 (two middle shelves) +20 (bottom) +15 (top)=55 books. So, each bookcase can hold 55 books. So, 110 books divided by 55 per bookcase is 2. So, 2 bookcases.

But wait, let me think again. If each bookcase has multiple shelves, does that mean that each bookcase can hold multiple books? Or is each shelf a separate unit? Hmm, the question says "each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books." So, each middle shelf is a separate shelf, each holding 10 books. The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, so 20. The top shelf holds 5 fewer than the bottom, so 15. So, each bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf. So, each bookcase can hold 20 +20 +15=55 books.

So, if she has 110 books, and each bookcase can hold 55, then 110 divided by 55 is 2. So, 2 bookcases. So, the answer is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm miscounting the number of shelves per bookcase. The problem says: "Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf."

So, each bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1
