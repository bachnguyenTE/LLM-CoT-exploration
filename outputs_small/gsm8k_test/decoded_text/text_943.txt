Q: James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about James buying CDs and then selling some of them. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD costs $15. Hmm, wait, 10? That seems like a lot, but okay, let me go with that. So, he buys 10 CDs? Wait, no, it says 10 new CDs. So, 10 CDs. Each costs $15. So, I need to calculate the total cost before any discounts or sales.

Alright, so each CD is $15, and he buys 10 of them. So, the total cost before any discounts would be 10 multiplied by $15. Let me write that down: 10 * $15. That should be $50. Wait, 10 times 15 is 50? Yeah, that's right. So, he spends $50 on the CDs.

But then, he gets them for 40% off. Hmm, wait, 40% off? That seems a bit unusual. Maybe it's a typo? Because 40% is a bit high for a discount, but okay, let's go with it. So, 40% off on 10 CDs at $15 each.

So, first, I need to find out how much the discount is. 40% off? Wait, 40% off. So, 40% of $50. Let me calculate that. 40% as a decimal is 0.40. So, 0.40 multiplied by $50. That would be 0.40 * 50. Let me compute that: 0.4 * 50 is 20. So, the discount is $20.

Therefore, the total cost after the discount would be the original total minus the discount. So, $50 minus $20 is $30. So, he spends $30 on the CDs after the discount.

But then, he decides he doesn't like 5 of them. So, he has 10 minus 5, which is 5 CDs left. So, he sells 5 CDs. He sells them for $40. So, he sells 5 CDs for $40 total.

Wait, so he sold 5 CDs for $40. So, how much did he get? $40. So, he sold them for $40, which is more than the cost of the CDs. So, he made a profit.

But let me make sure I got all the steps right. So, he bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so that's 10 * 15 = $150. Then, he got them for 40% off. So, 40% of 150 is 0.40 * 150 = $60. So, the discount is $60, so the total cost after discount is 150 - 60 = $90. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did before.

Wait, now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought 40% off, but now I'm calculating 40% off. Which one is correct? The problem says 40% off. So, 40% off. So, 40% of 150 is 60, so the total cost is 150 - 60 = $90.

But then, he sells 5 CDs for $40. So, he sells 5 CDs for $40. So, how much does he make? $40. So, he spent $90 and made $40. So, his net loss is 90 - 40 = $50.

Wait, that seems like a big loss. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD cost $15. He gets them for 40% off. He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?"

So, the discount is 40%, so 40% off. So, 40% of 150 is 60, so total cost is 150 - 60 = 84. Wait, no, 150 - 60 is 84? Wait, 150 - 60 is 90. Wait, no, 150 - 60 is 90. Wait, 150 - 60 is
