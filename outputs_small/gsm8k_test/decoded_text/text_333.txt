Q: Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers. Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. What is the cost difference between the two offers?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost for each furniture offer by adding the advance payment to the sum of the monthly installments.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 payments × $350 = $1800
- Total cost: $1,350 + $1,800 = $3,150

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 payments × $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Next, I'll find the difference between the two total costs to determine the cost difference.

To determine the cost difference between the two furniture offers, let's break down each offer step by step.

### Furniture United Offer:
- **Advance PAYMENT:** \$1,350
- **Monthly Installments:** 6 payments of \$350 each

\[
\text{Total Monthly Installments} = 6 \times \$350 = \$2,100
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance PAYMENT} + \text{Total Monthly Installments} = \$1,350 + \$2,100 = \$3,450
\]

### Cozy Homes Offer:
- **Advance PAYMENT:** \$1,100
- **Monthly Installments:** 9 payments of \$250 each

\[
\text{Total Monthly Installments} = 9 \times \$250 = \$2,250
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance PAYMENT} + \text{Total Monthly Installments} = \$1,100 + \$2,250 = \$3,350
\]

### Cost Difference:
\[
\text{Cost Difference} = \text{Furniture United Total Cost} - \text{Cozy Homes Total Cost} = \$3,450 - \$3,350 = \$100
\]

\[
\boxed{\$100}
\]
