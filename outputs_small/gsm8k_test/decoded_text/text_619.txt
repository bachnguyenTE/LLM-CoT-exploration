Q: Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights. If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, calculate the total number of functioning street lights if 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about streetlights at an intersection. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says each pole has 4 street lights. Hmm, so each pole contributes 4 lights. Then, it mentions that each intersection has 6 poles. So, for one intersection, there are 6 poles, each with 4 street lights. That means, for one intersection, the total number of street lights should be 6 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down:

6 poles * 4 lights per pole = 24 lights per intersection.

Alright, so each intersection has 24 street lights. Now, the road has 4 intersections. So, to find the total number of street lights on the entire road, I need to multiply the number of lights per intersection by the number of intersections. That would be:

24 lights per intersection * 4 intersections = 96 lights total.

Wait, hold on, 24 times 4 is 96? That doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. 24 times 4 is actually 96, right? Because 20 times 4 is 80, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 80 plus 16 is 96. Hmm, no, that's not correct. 24 times 4 is 96? Wait, 24 times 4 is 96. Yeah, I must have messed up the multiplication earlier. So, 24 * 4 is 96. That makes more sense.

So, the total number of street lights on the entire road is 96. But then the problem says that 20 streetlights from the total number are not working. So, we need to subtract those 20 from the total to find the number of functioning streetlights.

So, 96 total lights minus 20 non-functional lights equals... let me calculate that. 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 more is 70. Wait, no, that's not right. 96 minus 20 is actually 76. Because 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 more is 70. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me do it step by step.

96 minus 20 is 76. Then, 76 minus 6 is 70. So, 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 is 70. So, the total number of functioning streetlights is 70.

Wait, hold on, let me verify that. 24 lights per intersection, 4 intersections: 24*4=96. Then, 20 are not working, so 96-20=76. Wait, 96-20 is 76, not 70. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

24*4=96. Then, 96-20=76. So, the total number of functioning streetlights is 76.

Wait, but earlier I thought 24*4=96, which is correct, but then I thought 96-20=76, which is wrong. It should be 96-20=76? No, that's not right. 96 minus 20 is 76. Because 20 is 20, so 96-20 is 76. Wait, no, 96-20 is 76? Let me do it on paper.

96
-20
---
76

Yes, that's correct. So, 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 more is 70. Wait, no, 96-20 is 74, and then minus 6 is 68. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should do it differently.

Let me subtract 20 from 96. 96 minus 20 is 76, but 20 is 20, so 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 more is 70. Wait, no, that's not right. 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 is 70. Wait, no, 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 is 70. Wait, I'm getting myself confused here.

Let me try another approach. 96 minus 20 is 76, and then minus 6 is 7
