Q: Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes and a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. How many pounds of carrots did Daisy buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Daisy buying some potatoes, sweet potatoes, and carrots. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. That seems straightforward. So, potatoes = 5 pounds. Got that down.

Next, it says she bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. Hmm, okay. So, sweet potatoes are twice the weight of the potatoes. Since the potatoes are 5 pounds, sweet potatoes would be 2 times 5. Let me write that down: sweet potatoes = 2 * 5. That equals 10 pounds. So, sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds. That makes sense.

Now, the problem also mentions a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, carrots are 3 pounds less than sweet potatoes. Since sweet potatoes are 10 pounds, carrots would be 10 - 3. Let me calculate that: 10 - 3 = 7. So, carrots weigh 7 pounds. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If the sweet potatoes are twice the weight of the potatoes, which are 5 pounds, then 2*5 is indeed 10 pounds. Then, the carrots are 3 pounds less than that, so 10 - 3 is 7. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together: potatoes = 5, sweet potatoes = 10, carrots = 7. Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is 7.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems pretty straightforward. Sometimes, word problems can be tricky, but breaking it down step by step helps. I just need to make sure I interpret each part correctly. The potatoes are 5, sweet potatoes are twice that, so 10, and carrots are 3 less than sweet potatoes, so 7. Yep, that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is \boxed{7}.

Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The weight of the sweet potatoes is twice the weight of the potatoes, so:

\[
\text{Sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
\]

The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes, so:

\[
\text{Carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is \boxed{7}.
