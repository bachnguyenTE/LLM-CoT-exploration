Q: While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?

Okay, so I have this problem here where there are forty customers at a restaurant, and each gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Then, Julieta received 10% less in tips than Rafaela. I need to find out how much money both of them received altogether. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how much Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave him a $20 tip, I can calculate that by multiplying 40 by 20. Let me write that out:

Rafaela's tips = 40 customers * $20 per customer.

Hmm, 40 times 20. Let me do that multiplication. 40 times 20... Well, 40 times 20 is the same as 40 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that. 40 * 20. 40 times 20 is 800. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 40 * 20. 40*20 is 800. Yes, that seems correct. So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Okay, now Julieta received 10% less than that. So, I need to find 10% of Rafaela's tips and subtract that from his total. Let me write that down.

Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips.

Alternatively, I can think of it as Julieta's tips being 80% of Rafaela's tips because 10% less means you're left with 80%. Let me see which way is easier. Maybe calculating 10% of 800 and then subtracting that from 800 is straightforward.

So, 10% of 800. To find 10%, I can multiply 800 by 0.10. Let me compute that.

10% of 800 = 0.10 * 800 = 80.

So, 10% of 800 is $80. Therefore, Julieta's tips would be 800 - 80 = $720.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 10% of 800 is 80, then subtracting that from 800 gives 720. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Julieta received $720 in tips, and Rafaela received $800. Now, to find the total amount they received together, I just add those two amounts.

Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips = 800 + 720.

Let me add those. 800 + 720. 800 + 700 is 1580, and then plus 20 is still 1580. So, the total tips are $1580.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. So, 40 customers times $20 each is 40*20. 40*20 is 800, that's correct. Then, 10% of 800 is 80, so 800 - 80 is 720. Then, 800 + 720 is 1520. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, 800 + 720 is 1520? Wait, no, 800 + 720 is 1520? Wait, 800 + 700 is 1580, and then +20 is 1600? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 800 + 720.

Let me add 800 + 720. 800 + 700 is 1580, and then +20 is 1600. Wait, that's 1600. But earlier, I thought it was 1580. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, 800 + 720. Let me do it step by step. 800 + 700 is 1570, and then 80 + 20 is 100, so 1570 + 100 is 1670. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 800 + 720 is 1520? Wait,
