Q: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. How much profit did she earn on her bags?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost Tara incurred by purchasing the canvas bags. She bought 8 packs at $4 each, so the total cost is 8 multiplied by $4, which equals $32.

Next, I'll determine the total revenue she generated from selling the bags. She sold 8 bags at $8 each, so the total revenue is 8 multiplied by $8, resulting in $64.

Finally, to find the profit, I'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue. That is, $64 minus $32, which gives a profit of $32.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   
   Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags at \$4 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4/\text{pack} = \$32
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   
   Tara sold 8 canvas bags at \$8 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 8 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$64
   \]

3. **Determine the Profit:**
   
   Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost.
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$64 - \$32 = \$32
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$32}
\]
