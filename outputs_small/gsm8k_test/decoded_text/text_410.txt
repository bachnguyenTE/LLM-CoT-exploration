Okay, so Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10. That's the starting amount. She went to a trinket shop and bought some taffy. The deal there was "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." Hmm, so for every pound she buys, she gets another pound at half price. She scooped up 2 pounds. Let me figure out how much she spent on the taffy.

First, the deal is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." So for every 1 pound she buys, she pays $3, and then gets another pound at half price. Half of $3 is $1.50. So for each pound she takes, she's paying $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 per 2 pounds. Since she bought 2 pounds, that would be 2 times $4.50, which is $9. So she spent $9 on the taffy.

Wait, let me double-check that. If she buys 1 pound for $3, and then gets another pound at half price, which is $1.50, so total per 2 pounds is $4.50. So for 2 pounds, that's $4.50. So yes, that's correct.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50. And 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. Let me calculate the cost of the magnets. 4 times $0.25 is $1.00. So the magnets cost $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses. The taffy was $9, the seashells were $1.50, and the magnets were $1.00. So total spent is $9 + $1.50 + $1.00. Let me add that up.

$9 + $1.50 is $10.50, and then adding $1.00 makes it $11.50. So she spent a total of $11.50 on taffy, $1.50 on seashells, and $1.00 on magnets. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the taffy was $9, the seashells were $1.50, and the magnets were $1.00. So total is $9 + $1.50 + $1.00.

Let me add them step by step. $9 + $1.50 is $10.50, and then adding $1.00 makes it $11.50. So she spent $11.50 in total.

She started with $10, so how much does she have left? $10 - $11.50. Wait, that can't be right because she can't have negative money. Did I make a mistake in calculating her total expenditure?

Wait, let me go back. The taffy deal: "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." So for 2 pounds, she pays $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. Then she bought 2 pounds of taffy, so that's $4.50. Then she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So 4 times $0.25 is $1.00. So total spent is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00.

Let me add that again: $4.50 + $1.50 is $6.00, and then adding $1.00 makes it $7.00. So she spent $7.000 in total.

Wait, so she started with $10.00, so $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left. So she has $3.00 left.

Wait, but earlier I thought she spent $11.50, but that was incorrect. Let me clarify.

The deal is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." So for each pound she buys, she gets another at half price. So for 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound, and then gets another pound at $1.50, so total is $4.50 for 2 pounds. So that's correct.

Then, the seashells are $1.50, and the magnets are 4 times $0.25, which
