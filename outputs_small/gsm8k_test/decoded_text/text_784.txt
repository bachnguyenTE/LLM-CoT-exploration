Q: Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG (miles per gallon). If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much money is Andy's car consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total distance Andy travels to work each week. He works from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. Since he travels one way each day, the round trip distance is 5 miles multiplied by 2, resulting in 10 miles per day.

Next, I'll calculate the total weekly distance by multiplying the daily round trip distance by the number of working days: 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles/week.

Now, I'll find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses each week. His car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, so the amount of gas used is the total miles driven divided by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.

Finally, to find out how much money Andy spends on fuel each week, I'll multiply the gallons of gas used by the price per gallon: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week.

**Solution:**

To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week in fuel, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Round Trip Distance:**
   
   - **One-way Distance:** 5 miles
   - **Round Trip Distance per Day:** \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day}\)

2. **Determine Weekly Round Trip Distance:**
   
   - **Number of Working Days:** 5 (Monday to Friday)
   - **Weekly Round Trip Distance:** \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week}\)

3. **Calculate Weekly Gas Consumption:**
   
   - **Fuel Efficiency:** 10 MPG (miles per gallon)
   - **Gallons of Gas Used:** \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ MPG}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week}\)

4. **Compute Weekly Fuel Cost:**
   
   - **Price per Gallon:** \$3
   - **Weekly Fuel Cost:** \(5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15/\text{week}\)

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$15}
