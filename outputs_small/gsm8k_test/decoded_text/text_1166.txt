Q: Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?

Okay, so I have this problem about an avocado tree producing fruits over its 10 years of life, but wait, the question says 10 years? Let me check. It says, "during its 10 years of life." Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with that. Anyway, let's see.

The problem states:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- Then, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

Wait, hold on. It says a 10-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. That doesn't make sense. It should be a 10-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Maybe a typo in the problem. Let me assume that's the case.

So, let's parse this step by step.

First, the initial amount is given for a 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits.

Then, a 6-year-old produces 3 times that initial amount. So, 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

A 7-year-old produces 7 times the initial amount. So, 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old. Hmm, but wait, the 10-year-old is mentioned later. Maybe I need to figure out the 10-year-old's production first.

Wait, the problem says during the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount. So, perhaps the 10-year-old is a different tree? Or maybe it's the same tree but in the 10th year.

Wait, the problem is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it.

Let me denote:

Let I be the initial amount of fruits produced by a 5-year-old tree. So, I = 50.

Then:

- 5-year-old: I = 50
- 6-year-old: 3I = 150
- 7-year-old: 7I = 350
- 8-year-old: 200 less than 10-year-old. Let me denote the 10-year-old's production as E. So, 8-year-old: E - 200
- 9-year-old: 0
- 10-year-old: 20I = 1000

Wait, but the 10-year-old tree is mentioned later, but the problem says "during its 10 years of life." So, maybe the 10-year-old is the same tree? Or is it a different tree?

Wait, the problem says: "a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits." So, perhaps the 10-year-old is a different tree? Or maybe it's the same tree but in the 10th year.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again:

"Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old one produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits."

Wait, so the 8-year-old produces 200 less than a 10-year-old. So, if the 10-year-old is a different tree, then the 8-year-old is 200 less than the 10-year-old. But the problem says "a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits." So, maybe the 10-year-old is the same tree, but in the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to parse it.

First, the initial amount is given for a 5-year-old: 50.

Then:

- 6-year-old: 3 * 50 = 150
- 7-year-old: 7 * 50 = 350
