Q: Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?

Okay, so I have this problem about Grandma walking, and I need to figure out how long it takes her to complete her 3-mile walk. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite trail. This trail includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the beach, she walks at a certain speed, and on the sidewalk, she walks at twice that speed. Also, it's given that 40 minutes of her walk are spent on the beach. I need to find the total time she takes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

Hmm, okay. Let me list out the given information:

- Total distance: 3 miles
- Beach distance: 2 miles
- Sidewalk distance: 1 mile
- Speed on beach: let's denote it as \( v \) miles per minute
- Speed on sidewalk: \( 2v \) miles per minute (since it's twice the beach speed)
- Time spent on beach: 40 minutes (which is 44 minutes)

So, the total time will be the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk. I know the time spent on the beach is 44 minutes, so I just need to find the time she spends on the sidewalk and add that to 44 minutes.

But wait, to find the time on the sidewalk, I need to know her speed on the sidewalk. Since speed is distance over time, I can rearrange that to time equals distance over speed. So, time on sidewalk would be \( \frac{1}{2v} \) hours? Wait, no, hold on. The units are in miles and minutes, so the speed is in miles per minute, so time will be in minutes. So, time on sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{2v} \) minutes.

But I don't know the value of \( v \). Hmm, maybe I can find \( v \) using the time spent on the beach.

She walks 2 miles on the beach at speed \( v \), so the time spent on the beach is \( \frac{2}{v} \) minutes. But the problem says that time is 44 minutes. So, \( \frac{2}{v} = 44 \). From this, I can solve for \( v \).

Let me write that equation:

\( \frac{2}{v} = 44 \)

So, solving for \( v \):

\( v = \frac{2}{44} \)

Simplify that:

\( v = \frac{1}{22} \) miles per minute.

Wait, that seems a bit slow, but okay, let's go with it. So, her speed on the beach is 0.5 miles per minute.

Then, her speed on the sidewalk is twice that, so \( 2v = 2 * \frac{1}{2} = 1 \) mile per minute.

So, she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 1 mile per minute, which means it takes her 1 minute to walk that mile.

Wait, that seems really fast, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check.

If she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at 1 mile per minute, that's 1 minute. So, that's correct.

So, the time on the sidewalk is 1 minute.

Therefore, the total time is 44 minutes (beach) + 1 minute (sidewalk) = 45 minutes.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, the trail is 3 miles, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, she walks 2 miles on the beach at 0.5 mph, which is 0.5 miles per minute, and 1 mile on the sidewalk at 1 mile per minute.

But hold on, 0.5 miles per minute is 30 miles per hour, which is pretty slow for walking. That seems unrealistic. Maybe I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, the problem says 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach. So, 44 minutes on the beach, 1 minute on the sidewalk. So, total time is 45 minutes. But 45 minutes seems too short for a 3-mile walk, especially if she's walking 2 miles on the beach at 0.5 mph.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check.

The problem says she walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, the total distance is 3 miles. The time on the beach is 44 minutes, so the time on the sidewalk is 1 minute. So, total time is 45 minutes.

But
