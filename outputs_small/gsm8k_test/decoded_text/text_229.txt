Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?

Okay, so I have this problem about a watermelon farm that produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. She took them home. Then, when she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. The question is asking how many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. The answer choices aren't provided, but I need to figure it out step by step.

First, let me try to understand the problem. There are 120 watermelons in total. Ashlyn takes 30% of them home the first time. Then, the remaining watermelons are left, and the next time she comes back, 3/4 of them are ready. We need to find out how many are not ready after the second harvest.

Let me break it down into steps.

1. **First Harvest:**
   - Total watermelons: 120
   - Percentage ready: 30% (which is 0.3 in decimal)
   - Number of watermelons taken home: 120 * 0.3
   - Let me calculate that: 120 * 0.3 = 36. So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons.

2. **Remaining Watermelons After First Harvest:**
   - Total: 120
   - Taken home: 36
   - Remaining: 120 - 36 = 114
   - So, 114 watermelons are left.

3. **Second Harvest:**
   - Now, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ready.
   - So, number taken home this time: 114 * (3/4)
   - Let me compute that: 114 * 0.75
   - Hmm, 114 * 0.75. Let me think. 100 * 0.75 is 75, and 14 * 0.75 is 3, so total is 75 + 3 = 78. So, 78 watermelons are taken home in the second harvest.

4. **Remaining Watermelons After Second Harvest:**
   - Total remaining after first harvest: 114
   - Taken home in second harvest: 78
   - So, remaining: 114 - 78 = 36

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. So, after the second harvest, 36 watermelons are left, which are not ready. But hold on, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.

Wait, no. Let me think again. After the first harvest, 36 are taken home, so 114 remain. Then, when she comes back, 3/4 of the remaining are ready, so she takes them home. So, 3/4 of 114 is 78, so she takes 78 home, leaving 114 - 78 = 36. So, 36 are not ready. So, the answer is 36.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you take percentages, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, 30% of 120 is 36, correct. So, 120 - 36 = 114. Then, 3/4 of 114 is 78, correct. So, 114 - 78 = 36. So, 36 are not ready.

But wait, the question is asking for the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. So, after the second harvest, 36 are not ready. So, is 36 the answer? Hmm.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the question. It says, "how many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?" So, after the second harvest, 36 are not ready. So, 36 is the answer.

But let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the question is asking for the total number of watermelons that were not ready at the end, regardless of when they were taken home. But that seems unlikely because the question specifies "after the two weeks," so it's after the second harvest.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the total number of watermelons that were not ready at the end, which would be 36. So,
