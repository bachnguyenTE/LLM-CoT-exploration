Q: A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the cost of almonds and walnuts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. I need to find out how much more it costs to buy a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to another mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for each mixture and then find the difference between them. That makes sense. Let me write that down.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Since almonds are $10 per pound, the cost for 1/2 pound would be 1/2 times $10. Similarly, walnuts are $15 per pound, so the cost for 1/3 pound would be 1/3 times $15. Then, I add those two amounts together to get the total cost for the first mixture.

Let me compute that. 

First, 1/2 pound of almonds: (1/2) * $10 = $5. 

Next, 1/3 pound of walnuts: (1/3) * $15. Hmm, 15 divided by 3 is 5, so that's $5.

So, the total cost for the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10. 

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Again, I'll calculate each part separately.

Starting with almonds: 1/5 pound at $10 per pound. So, (1/5) * $10. Let me compute that. 10 divided by 5 is 2, so that's $2.

Then, walnuts: 1/3 pound at $15 per pound. So, (1/3) * $15. 15 divided by 3 is 5, so that's $5.

Adding those together, the total cost for the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Alright, so now I have the total costs for each mixture: $10 for the first mixture and $7 for the second. The question is asking how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second. So, I need to subtract the second total from the first total.

That would be $10 - $7 = $3.

Wait, so the first mixture is $3 more expensive than the second one? Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First mixture: 1/2 pound almonds: 1/2 * 10 = 5. 1/3 pound walnuts: 1/3 * 15 = 5. Total: 5 + 5 = 10. That seems right.

Second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds: 1/5 * 10 = 2. 1/3 pound walnuts: 1/3 * 15 = 5. Total: 2 + 5 = 7. That also seems correct.

Subtracting the two totals: 10 - 7 = 3. So, yes, the first mixture is $3 more expensive. 

Wait, hold on a second. Let me think about this again. The problem says "a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts" versus "a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts." So, in the first mixture, we have more walnuts (1/3 pound) and less almonds (1/2 pound) compared to the second mixture, which has more almonds (1/5 pound) and the same amount of walnuts (1/3 pound). 

Since walnuts are more expensive, having more walnuts in the first mixture should make it more expensive. But in the second mixture, we have more almonds, which are cheaper, so that might offset the extra walnuts. 

So, the difference in cost is $3, which is the amount by which the first mixture is more expensive. That seems to make sense because the extra walnuts in the first mixture are 1/3 pound, which is more than the extra almonds in the second mixture, which is 1/5 pound. 

Wait, let me compute the difference in the amounts of each fruit to see which one is more expensive.

In the first mixture, we have 1/3 pound more walnuts than the second mixture. In the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound more almonds than the first mixture. 

Since walnuts are
