Q: Alani's family decided that the children should write stories of any kind. They were then required to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.

Okay, so I have this problem here about Alani's family and their reading of stories. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Then her brother, Braylen, wrote 40 stories, and her sister, Margot, wrote 60 stories. So, that's the initial number of stories each of them wrote. 

Then, it says that in the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Hmm, okay, so that means each of them wrote twice as many as they did in the first week. I need to calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether after both weeks.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I should find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they doubled their first week's count, I can calculate that by multiplying each of their first week totals by 2.

Starting with Alani: she wrote 20 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she wrote 20 times 2. Let me do that multiplication: 20 * 2. Hmm, 20 times 2 is 40. So, Alani wrote 40 stories in the second week.

Next, Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she doubled that. That would be 40 * 2. Let me calculate that: 40 * 2 is 80. So, Braylen wrote 80 stories in the second week.

Then, Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she doubled that as well. That would be 60 * 2. Let me do that: 60 * 2 is 120. So, Margot wrote 120 stories in the second week.

Now, I need to find the total number of stories they wrote altogether. That means I have to add up all the stories each person wrote over both weeks. So, I have Alani's total, Braylen's total, and Margot's total.

Let me write that down:

- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week)
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week)
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week)

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake there. I should actually add all the stories each person wrote in both weeks, not separately. So, let me correct that.

So, Alani wrote 20 in week 1 and 40 in week 2. So, her total is 20 + 40. Let me compute that: 20 + 40 is 60. So, Alani wrote 60 stories in total.

Braylen wrote 40 in week 1 and 80 in week 2. So, her total is 40 + 80. Let me add those: 40 + 80 is 120. So, Braylen wrote 120 stories in total.

Margot wrote 60 in week 1 and 120 in week 2. So, her total is 60 + 120. Let me add those: 60 + 120 is 180. So, Margot wrote 180 stories in total.

Now, to find the overall total number of stories they wrote altogether, I need to add up Alani's total, Braylen's total, and Margot's total. So, that's 60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot).

Let me add them step by step. First, 60 + 120 is 170. Wait, no, 60 + 120. Let me do that properly.

60 + 120: 60 + 100 is 71, and then +20 is 91. So, 60 + 120 is 186. Then, adding Margot's total, which is 180, to that. So, 186 + 180.

Let me add 186 + 180. 186 + 180 is 366, and then +0 is still 366. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 186 + 180. Let me do it properly.

186 + 180: 100
