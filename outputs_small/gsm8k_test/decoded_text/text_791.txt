Okay, so I have this problem here about a train with 172 people on it. Then, at the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. After that, at the next stop, another 38 people get off. I need to figure out how many people are on the train after these stops. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the train starts with 172 people. That's straightforward. Now, at the first stop, 47 people get off. So, I should subtract 47 from 172 to find out how many are left after that. Let me do the math: 172 minus 47. Hmm, 172 minus 40 is 168, and then minus 3 more is 165. So, after the first stop, there are 165 people on the train.

But wait, then 13 more people get on. So, I need to add those 13 to the current number of people on the train. That would be 165 plus 13. Let me calculate that: 165 plus 10 is 175, and then plus 3 is 178. So, after the first stop, the train has 178 people on it.

Now, moving on to the next stop. Another 38 people get off. So, I need to subtract 38 from the current number of people on the train, which is 178. Let me do that subtraction: 178 minus 38. Hmm, 178 minus 30 is 148, and then minus 8 more is 140. So, after the second stop, there are 140 people on the train.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 172, subtract 47: 172 - 47. Let me do it another way. 172 minus 40 is 132, and then minus 7 is 125. Wait, that's different from what I did before. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Oh, no, wait, 172 minus 47. Let me count down from 172: 172, 171, 170, 169, 168, 167, 166, 165, 164, 163, 162, 161, 160, 159, 158, 157, 156, 155, 154, 153, 152, 151, 150, 149, 148, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, 140, 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, 133, 132, 131, 130, 129, 128, 127, 126, 125. Wait, that's 125. So, 172 minus 47 is 125, not 165. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, let me correct that. After the first stop, it's 125 people. Then, 13 more get on. So, 125 plus 13 is 138. Then, at the next stop, 38 get off. So, 138 minus 38. Let me calculate that: 138 minus 30 is 108, minus 8 is 100. So, 100 people on the train after the second stop.

Wait, that seems different from my initial calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in my first calculation when I thought it was 165. So, let me correct that.

Starting with 172, subtract 47: 172 - 47 = 125. Then, add 13: 125 + 13 = 138. Then, subtract 38: 138 - 38 = 100. So, the final number is 100.

Wait, but let me make
