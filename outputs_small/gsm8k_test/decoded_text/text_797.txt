Q: Carrie is planning the caroling schedule. The choir plans to sing "Deck the Halls" twice and "Jingle Bells" once. If "Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds long and "Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds long, how long will they be caroling?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many times each carol will sing the songs. The choir plans to sing "Deck the Halls" twice and "Jingle Bells" once.

Next, I'll calculate the total duration for each song by multiplying the number of times it's sung by its duration. For "Deck the Halls," that's 2 times multiplied by 150 seconds, and for "Jingle Bells," it's 1 time multiplied by 240 seconds.

Finally, I'll add the total durations of both songs together to find the overall duration of the carol singing.

**Solution:**

To determine the total duration Carrie will be caroling, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of times each song is sung:**
   - "Deck the Halls" is sung **2 times**.
   - "Jingle Bells" is sung **1 time**.

2. **Calculate the total duration for each song:**
   - **"Deck the Halls"**:
     \[
     2 \text{ times} \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **"Jingle Bells"**:
     \[
     1 \text{ time} \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Add the durations of both songs to find the total carol singing time:**
   \[
   300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{540\ \text{ seconds}}
\]
