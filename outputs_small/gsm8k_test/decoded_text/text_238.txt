Q: Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessa. If Jessa is 20 years old, what is the sum of the ages of the three girls?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mary, Joan, and Jessa, and I need to find the sum of their ages. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says, "Mary is two years younger than Joan." Hmm, okay. So if I know Joan's age, I can find Mary's age by subtracting two years. But wait, I don't know Joan's age yet. The problem also mentions that "Jona is five years older than Jessa." So Jessa's age is given as 20 years old. That seems straightforward.

Let me write down what I know:

- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.

So, starting with Jessa, who is 20. Then Joan is five years older than that. So Joan's age would be 20 plus 5. Let me calculate that: 20 + 5 is 27. So Joan is 27 years old.

Now, Mary is two years younger than Joan. Since Joan is 27, Mary's age would be 27 minus 2. Let me do that subtraction: 27 - 2 is 25. So Mary is 25 years old.

Now, I need to find the sum of their ages. That means I have to add up Mary's age, Joan's age, and Jessa's age. So that's 25 (Mary) + 27 (Joan) + 20 (Jessa). Let me add them up step by step.

First, 25 + 27. Hmm, 25 plus 20 is 45, and then plus 7 is 52. So 25 + 27 is 52. Then, I need to add Jessa's age, which is 20. So 52 + 20. Let me see, 52 + 20 is 72. So the total sum of their ages is 72.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Jessa is 20, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25, and Mary is 25 - 2 = 23. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. If Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is 25, then Mary should be 23, not 25. Wait, did I do that right?

Wait, no, hold on. If Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is 25, then Mary is 25 - 2 = 23. So Mary is 23. Then, adding up 23 (Mary) + 25 (Joan) + 20 (Jessa). Let me add 23 + 25 first. 23 + 25 is 48. Then, 48 + 20 is 68. Wait, that's different from before. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I messed up the initial calculation. Let me go back. So, if Jessa is 20, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25. Then Mary is 25 - 2 = 23. So Mary is 23. So adding 23 + 25 + 20. Let me add 23 + 25 first. 23 + 25 is 48. Then 48 + 20 is 68. So the total sum is 68.

Wait, so earlier I thought Mary was 25, but that was a mistake. Let me correct that. So, if Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is 25 years older than Jessa, who is 20, then Joan is 27, and Mary is 25. Wait, no, that can't be. If Joan is 27, Mary is 25. So 27 - 2 is 25. So Mary is 25. So 25 + 27 +20 is 52. Wait, that's different.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me try to write this down more clearly.

Given:

- Jessa's age = 20
- Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 22 +5 = 27
- Mary's age = Joan's age -2 = 27 -2 = 25

So, Mary is 25, Joan is 27, Jessa is 20.

Sum of their ages: 25 + 27 +
