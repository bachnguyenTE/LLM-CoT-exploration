Q: Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate Jen's total working hours for April. She works 7.5 hours each day for 6 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in April. So, I'll multiply 7.5 by 6 to get the weekly hours, and then multiply that by 4 to find the total hours for the month.

Next, I'll determine her total earnings from her hourly rate by multiplying her hourly rate of $1.5 by the total working hours calculated earlier.

Additionally, since Jen had complete attendance, she receives an extra $10. I'll add this amount to her total earnings from the hourly rate to find her total compensation for April.

Finally, I'll present the final amount she will receive.

**Solution:**

Jen's total earnings for April can be calculated by considering both her hourly rate and the additional bonus for complete attendance.

1. **Calculate Total Working Hours:**
   
   - **Hours per day:** 7.5
   - **Days per week:** 6
   - **Weeks in April:** 4

   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Earnings from Hourly Rate:**
   
   - **Hourly Rate:** \$1.50
   - **Total Hours Worked:** 180 hours

   \[
   \text{Earnings from Hourly Rate} = 1.50 \times 180 = \$270.00
   \]

3. **Add Bonus for Complete Attendance:**
   
   - **Bonus:** \$10.00

   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \$270.00 + \$10.00 = \$280.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$280.00}
\]
