Q: Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. He starts working at 8:0 AM and goes until 11:0 PM. I need to figure out how many reports he staple altogether. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably figure out how long he's been working. He starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 11:00 PM. Wait, no, the problem says until 11:00 PM, but it's written as 11:0 PM. Hmm, maybe it's 11:00 PM? I think that's a typo. So, he works from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That makes sense because 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a pretty long shift.

Now, to find out how many reports he can staple in total, I need to calculate the total time he spends working and then see how many 15-minute intervals are in that time. Then, multiply the number of intervals by 30 reports per interval.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total time he works. He starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 11:00 PM. So, from 8:0 AM to 11:0 PM is how many hours?

Wait, 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is actually 15 hours. Because from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM is 3 hours, and then from 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM is another 12 hours. So, 3 + 12 = 15 hours total.

Alternatively, I can calculate the time difference. From 8:00 AM to 11:0 PM is 3 hours, and from 11:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 10 hours. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 3 hours, and then from 11:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 0 hours. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Because from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. So, that's 15 hours total.

So, he works 15 hours.

Now, he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, in 15 minutes, he does 30 reports. So, how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours?

First, let's convert 15 hours into minutes. 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

So, he works for 900 minutes.

Now, each 15-minute interval is 15 minutes, so the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes is 900 / 15.

Let me calculate that: 900 divided by 15. 15 goes into 90 six times (15*6=90), so 15 goes into 900 sixty times. So, 60 intervals.

Each interval, he stumps 30 reports. So, total reports = 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval.

60 * 30 is 1800.

Wait, 60*30: 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30: 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, 60*30 is 1800? Wait, no,
