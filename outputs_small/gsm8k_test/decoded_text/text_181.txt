Q: Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sandra and Fred, and I need to figure out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Hmm, okay. So if I let the number of white carnations be some variable, say W, then the number of red roses would be 4 times that, right? So red roses = 4W.

Next, it mentions that Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and that's equal to five times the white carnations. So, 200 = 5W. Wait, hold on, 200? Is that 200 or 200? Maybe that's a typo. Let me check the original problem again.

It says: "She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations." So, 200 is the number of pink calla lilies. So, 220 = 5W. So, to find W, I can divide both sides by 5. So, W = 220 / 5. Let me calculate that. 220 divided by 5 is 44. So, W = 44. That means the number of white carnations is 44.

Now, since red roses are four times the white carnations, red roses = 4 * 44. Let me compute that. 4 times 40 is 160, and 4 times 4 is 16, so 160 + 16 is 176. So, red roses are 176.

Wait, but the problem says Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. So, Fred must deliver all the red roses by 5 pm. So, the number of red roses Fred must deliver is 176? Wait, no, 4 times 44 is 176, right? So, 176 red roses.

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes. So, white carnations: 220 = 5W, so W = 220 /5 = 44. That's correct. Then red roses are 4 times that, so 4*44. Let me do 4*40=160 and 4*4=16, so 160+16=176. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Fred must deliver 176 red roses by 5 pm. So, the answer is 176.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, red roses = 4*white carnations. Then, she also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, 200 = 5*white carnations. So, white carnations = 200 /5 =44. Then red roses =4*44=176. So, yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the number of red roses Fred must deliver is 176.

**Final Answer**
The number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \boxed{176}.

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( W \) be the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).

She also ordered 220 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Thus, we have:
\[ 220 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{220}{5} = 44 \]

The number of red roses is:
\[ 4W = 4 \times 44 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \(\boxed{176}\).
