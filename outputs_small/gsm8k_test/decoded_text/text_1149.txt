Q: Jen got 3 fish.  They each need $1 worth of food a day.  How much does she spend on food in the month of May?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many days are in May. May has 31 days.

Next, I'll calculate the daily food cost. Each person spends $1 per day, so for 3 people, the daily cost is $3.

Then, I'll multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May to find the total monthly food cost: $3 multiplied by 31 equals $93.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of days in May:**
   
   May has **31 days**.

2. **Calculate the daily food cost:**
   
   Each person needs \$1 worth of food per day.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 3 \text{ people} \times \$1/\text{person/day} = \$3/\text{day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly food cost:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total monthly cost} = 31 \text{ day} \times \$3/\text{day} = \$93
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{93}
\]
