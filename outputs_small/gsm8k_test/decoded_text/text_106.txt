Q: John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?

Okay, so I have this problem here where John has 3 boxes, each with dimensions 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, and I need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the inner volume of a box would be its volume minus the volume taken up by the walls. Since each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, I need to figure out how much space is left inside after subtracting the walls.

Let me visualize one box. It's a rectangular prism, right? So, the outer dimensions are 5 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick on all sides. That means on each side of the box, the inner dimensions will be smaller by 2 inches in each dimension because the wall is on both sides.

Wait, let me make sure. If the wall is 1 inch thick, then on the length, the inner length would be 5 inches minus 1 inch from one end and 1 inch from the other end, so 5 - 2 = 3 inches. Similarly, the inner width would be 6 - 2 = 4 inches, and the inner height would be 4 - 2 = 2 inches. Is that right?

Hold on, maybe I should think about it differently. If the walls are 1 inch thick, then the inner dimensions are calculated by subtracting twice the wall thickness from each dimension. So, for length, it's 5 - 2*1 = 3 inches. For width, it's 6 - 2*1 = 4 inches. For height, it's 4 - 2*1 = 2 inches. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the inner dimensions of one box would be 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. Now, to find the inner volume, I can multiply these together. Let me calculate that: 3 * 4 = 12, and 12 * 2 = 24. So, the inner volume of one box is 24 cubic inches.

But wait, the question is about 3 boxes. So, I need to multiply this inner volume by 3. Let me do that: 24 * 3 = 72. So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit small. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the inner dimensions.

Original outer dimensions: 5x6x4 inches. Each wall is 1 inch thick. So, for each dimension, subtract 2 inches (1 inch from each side). So, 5 - 2 = 3, 6 -2 =4, 4 -2=2. So, inner dimensions are 3x4x2. Volume is 3*4*2=24. Then, 3 boxes would be 24*3=72. Hmm, so 72 cubic inches.

Wait, but 72 seems a bit low. Let me think again. Maybe I should calculate the outer volume first and then subtract the wall volume.

The outer volume of one box is 5*6*4=120 cubic inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner volume is 126 - 126? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the inner volume by considering the inner dimensions as (length - 2*thickness) * (width - 2*thickness) * (height - 2*thickness). So, that would be (5 - 2*1)*(6 - 2*1)*(4 - 2*1) = (5 - 2)*(6 - 2)*(4 - 2) = 3*4*2=24. So, that's 24 per box, times 3 is 72. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the inner volume as the outer volume minus the volume of the walls. But that might be more complicated because the walls are on all sides, so it's not just subtracting a small cube.

Wait, another way: the inner volume is the volume of the space inside the box, which is 1 inch less on each side. So, the inner dimensions are 3x4x2, as I calculated before, so 24 per box, times 3 is 72.

But let me think about the units. Each dimension is in inches, so the volume is in cubic inches. So, 72 cubic inches is the total inner volume.

Wait, but 72 seems a bit low. Let me check the original outer volume. Each box is
