Q: John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John's car breaking down, and I need to figure out how much force he needs to push it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

John's car weighs 1200 pounds, and inside it, he has luggage weighing 250 pounds. He also has two young children, each weighing 75 pounds. The force to move the car is 1% of its weight. I need to find out how much force he needs to push the car.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I think I need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. That means adding up the weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children.

So, the car is 1200 pounds. Then, the luggage is 250 pounds. Each child is 75 pounds, and there are two of them. So, I should calculate the total weight of the luggage and the children first.

Let me write that out:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (75 * 2)

Let me compute that. First, 75 times 2 is 150. Then, adding that to the luggage and the car:

1200 + 250 is... let me see, 1200 + 250. Hmm, 1200 + 200 is 1400, and then +50 is 1450. So, 1450. Then, adding 150 (which is 75*2) gives 1450 + 150. Let me add 1450 + 150. 1450 + 100 is 1550, and then +50 is 1600. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1450 + 150 is 1600? Let me check that again.

Wait, 1450 + 150 is 1600, yes. So, 1450 + 150 is 1600. So, the total weight is 1600 pounds.

Wait, hold on, 1200 + 250 is 1450, and 75*2 is 150, so 1450 + 150 is 1600. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total weight is 1600 pounds. Now, the force needed to move the car is 1% of its weight. So, I need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

To find 1% of a number, you can multiply it by 0.01. So, 1600 * 0.01.

Let me compute that. 1600 divided by 100 is 16. So, 1600 * 0.01 is 160. So, 1% is 16 pounds.

Wait, is that right? 1% of 1600 is 16. Yes, because 10% of 1600 is 160, so 1% is 16. So, the force needed is 16 pounds.

Wait, but let me double-check. 1% is 0.01 in decimal, so 1600 * 0.01 is 160.0, which is 160.0, but since we're dealing with pounds, it's 160 pounds. Wait, hold on, no, 1600 * 0.01 is 160.0, which is 160 pounds. Wait, no, 1600 * 0.01 is 160.0, which is 160 pounds. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 1600 divided by 10 is 160. So, 1600 * 0.1 is 160. So, 1% is 160 pounds. So, 1600 * 0.01 is 16.0 pounds. Wait, no, 1600 * 0.01 is 160, so 1600 * 0.01 is 160, and 1600 * 0.01 is 1
