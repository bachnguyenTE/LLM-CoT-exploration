Q: John buys a cassette with 2 songs.  The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer.  How much time was the total cassette?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John buys a cassette with two songs. The first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first. I need to figure out the total time the cassette lasts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the first song is straightforward—it's 5 minutes. The second song is a bit trickier because it says it's 60% longer than the first. So, I need to calculate what 60% of 5 minutes is and then add that to the original 5 minutes to get the total length of the second song. After that, I can add both songs together to find the total time of the cassette.

Let me write this down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. 

1. The first song is 5 minutes. That's easy.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first. So, I need to find 60% of 5 minutes and then add that to 5 minutes.

To find 60% of 5 minutes, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by 5. So, 60% is the same as 0.66 in decimal form. Let me check that: 60 divided by 100 is 0.66. Yep, that's right.

So, 0.66 multiplied by 5 minutes. Let me do that multiplication. 0.66 times 5. Hmm, 0.6 times 5 is 3, and 0.06 times 5 is 0.3, so adding those together gives 3 + 0.3 = 3.3 minutes. So, 60% of 5 minutes is 3.3 minutes.

Now, the second song is 5 minutes plus 3.3 minutes. Let me add those together. 5 + 3.3 is 8.3 minutes. So, the second song is 8.3 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, I need to add the first song and the second song together. The first song is 5 minutes, and the second is 8.3 minutes. So, 5 + 8.3 is 13.3 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 5 plus 8 is 13, and then plus 0.3 is 13.3. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the total time of the cassette is 13.3 minutes. Hmm, that seems a bit short, but considering the second song is only 60% longer, maybe it's correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the length of the second song differently. If the second song is 60% longer, that means it's 100% + 60% = 160% of the first song. So, 160% of 5 minutes. Let me compute that.

160% as a decimal is 1.6. So, 1.6 multiplied by 5 minutes. 1 times 5 is 5, and 0.6 times 5 is 3, so 5 + 3 is 8. So, that's 8 minutes. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, hold on. If the second song is 60% longer, that means it's 100% + 60% = 160% of the original. So, 160% of 5 minutes is 8 minutes. But earlier, I thought of it as 60% of 5 minutes, which is 3.3 minutes, and then adding that to 5 minutes, giving 8.3 minutes. So, which is correct?

I think I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me clarify. If something is 60% longer, that means it's 100% of the original. So, 100% + 60% = 160%. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 100% is the original, so 60% longer would be 100% + 60% = 160%. So, 160% of the original.

So, 160% of 5 minutes is 1.60 * 5. Let me compute that. 1 * 5 is 5, 0.6 * 5 is 3, 0.02 * 5 is 0.1. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 1.6
