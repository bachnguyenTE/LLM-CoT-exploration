Q: Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. What are their combined weights in pounds?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds. Hmm, that's straightforward. Now, the problem says Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Hmm, let me break that down. 

First, I need to find out how much Alex weighs. The problem mentions Grace's weight, which is 125 pounds. So, I think I should multiply Grace's weight by 4 first. Let me write that down: 4 times 125. 

Wait, 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 25 is 100. So, adding those together, 400 plus 100 is 540. So, 4 times 125 is 500? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. 125 times 4: 100 times 4 is 400, and 25 times 4 is 100, so 400 plus 100 is 540. Yeah, that's correct. So, 4 times 125 is 540 pounds. 

Now, the problem says Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that. So, I need to subtract 2 pounds from 540 pounds. Let me do that: 540 minus 2 is 538. So, Alex weighs 538 pounds. 

Now, the question is asking for their combined weights. So, I need to add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together. Grace is 125 pounds, and Alex is 538 pounds. Let me add those two numbers. 

125 plus 538. Let me add the units place first: 5 plus 8 is 13. I'll write down 3 and carry over 1. Then, the tens place: 2 plus 3 is 5, plus the carried over 1 is 6. Then, the hundreds place: 1 plus 5 is 6. So, putting it all together, that's 663. 

Wait, let me double-check that addition. 125 plus 538. 100 plus 500 is 600, 20 plus 30 is 50, and 5 plus 8 is 13. So, 600 plus 50 is 650, plus 13 is 663. Yeah, that's correct. So, their combined weight is 663 pounds. 

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Grace is 125, 4 times that is 500, wait, no, 4 times 125 is 500? Wait, no, 125 times 4 is 500? Wait, 125 times 4: 100 times 4 is 400, 20 times 4 is 80, 5 times 4 is 20. So, 400 plus 80 is 480, plus 20 is 500. So, 4 times 125 is 500. Then, subtract 2, so 500 - 2 is 500 - 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498. Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, I'm getting confused here. 

Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 498? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 500 minus 2 is 548? Wait, no, 5
