Q: George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Okay, so George needs to pay for dental work, and he needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. Hmm, let me write that down. So, 2 implants times $2000 each. That should be 2 times 2000. Let me calculate that. 2000 times 2 is 4000. So, the total cost for the implants is $4000.

But wait, he also wants a crown on one of the implants. The crown costs an extra $500. So, that's an additional $500. So, I need to add that to the total cost. So, $4000 plus $500. Let me add those together. 4000 plus 500. 4000 plus 500 is 5000. Wait, is that right? 4000 plus 500 is 4900? Wait, no, 4000 plus 500 is 4900. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total cost for the dental work is $4900.

Now, George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he's already saved up $600. I need to subtract that from the total cost to see how much more he needs to pay. So, $4900 minus $600. Let me do that subtraction. 4900 minus 600. 4900 minus 600 is 4300. Wait, is that right? 4900 minus 600. Let me break it down. 4900 minus 600 is 4300, and then minus another 60 is 4240. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should do it step by step.

Wait, 4900 minus 600 is 4300. Then, subtract another 60, so 4300 minus 60 is 4240. Yeah, that's correct. So, George still needs to pay $4240.

He makes $15 per hour at work. So, I need to figure out how many hours he needs to work to make at least $4240. So, let me set up the equation. Let h be the number of hours he needs to work. So, 15h is the total amount he makes. He needs 15h to be greater than or equal to 4240. So, 15h ≥ 4240.

To find h, I need to divide both sides by 15. So, h ≥ 4240 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 4240 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 times 280 is 4200. So, 15 times 282 is 4230. Wait, 15 times 282 is 4230. Then, 4240 minus 4230 is 10. So, 4240 divided by 15 is 282 with a remainder of 10. So, 282.666... hours.

But since he can't work a fraction of an hour, he needs to work full hours. So, he needs to work 283 hours to make at least $4245, which is more than enough to cover the $4240 he needs. So, he needs to work 283 hours.

Wait, let me double-check that. 15 times 283 is 15 times 280 plus 15 times 3. 15 times 280 is 4000, and 15 times 3 is 45. So, 4000 plus 45 is 4045. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 15 times 283 is 15 times 283. Let me do it step by step.

283 times 10 is 2830, times 15 is 2830 plus 2830 is 5660. Wait, that's not right either. Wait, no, 15 times 283 is 15 times 200 is 3000, 15 times 80 is 1200, 15 times 3 is 45. So, 3000
