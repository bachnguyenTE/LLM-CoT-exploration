Q: In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a family of 5, and I need to figure out how many eggs they consume in a week. Let me read it again: "In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?" Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, the family has 5 people. Out of these, three people eat 3 eggs each day. That means the remaining people must be eating fewer eggs. Since there are 5 people in total, subtracting the 3 who eat 3 eggs each day, that leaves 2 people. So, these two people eat 2 eggs each day. Got that.

Now, I need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day and then multiply that by 7 to get the weekly consumption. Let me write this out.

For the three people: Each of them eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total eggs consumed by them per day would be 3 people multiplied by 3 eggs each. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

For the remaining two people: Each of them eats 2 eggs a day. So, the total eggs consumed by them per day would be 2 people multiplied by 2 eggs each. That's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, to find the total daily consumption for the whole family, I need to add the eggs consumed by the first group and the second group. So, 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day.

Wait, let me double-check that. Three people eating 3 eggs each: 3*3=9. Two people eating 2 eggs each: 2*2=4. 9+4=13. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the family consumes 13 eggs each day. Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, I need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 days. So, 13 eggs/day * 7 days.

Let me calculate that. 13*7. Hmm, 10*7=70, and 3*7=21, so 70+21=91. So, 13*7=91. Therefore, the family consumes 91 eggs in a week.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my multiplication. 13 times 7: 10*7=70, 3*7=21, 70+21=91. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 13*7. 10*7=70, 3*7=21, so 70+21=91. Yep, same result.

So, just to recap: 3 people eat 3 eggs each, so 9 eggs. 2 people eat 2 eggs each, so 4 eggs. Total per day is 13. 13 eggs per day times 7 days is 91 eggs.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the total eggs consumed by each group separately and then adding them together. Let me try that.

First group: 3 people * 3 eggs = 9 eggs.

Second group: 2 people * 2 eggs = 4 eggs.

Total eggs: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

Same result as before. So, 13 eggs per day times 7 days is 91 eggs.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total number of eggs consumed each day is 13, so over 7 days, it's 13*7=91.

Wait, 13*7: 10*7=70, 3*7=21, 70+21=91. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I want to do it in a different way, maybe by calculating the total eggs consumed by each group over a week and then adding them together.

First group: 3 people * 3 eggs/day *7 days.

So, 3*3=9 eggs per day, 9*7=63 eggs.

Second group: 2 people *2 eggs/day *7 days.

2*2=4 eggs per day, 4*7=28 eggs.

Total eggs: 63 +28=91 eggs.

Same answer. So, that's another way to get to the same result.

Alternatively, I can think of the total number of eggs consumed by all the people in the family in a week.

But that might complicate things, but let me try
