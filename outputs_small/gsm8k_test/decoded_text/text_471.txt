Q: There are 30 students in Marissa’s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. How many pencils were left?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Marissa's class. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 30 students in Marissa’s class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. So, I think I need to find out the total number of pencils the class had at the beginning. Since each of the 30 students has 10 pencils, I can multiply 30 by 10 to get the total number of pencils.

Let me write that down: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils. So, the class started with 300 pencils in total.

Then, after two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in the class were used. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find out how many pencils were used, which is 1/5 of 300. To calculate that, I can do 330 * (1/5). Let me compute that: 330 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 33 six times (5*6=30), with a remainder of 3. Then bring down the 0, making it 30. 5 goes into 30 six times again. So, 66.6? Wait, that can't be right because 5*66=330. Wait, no, 5*66 is 330. So, 330 divided by 5 is 66.6? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 5*66 is 330, which is less than 330. Wait, maybe I did that wrong.

Wait, 5*60 is 300, right? Because 5*60=300. So, 330-300=30. So, 30 left. So, 30 divided by 5 is 0. So, total is 66.6? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 5*66=330, so 330 divided by 5 is 66. So, 330 divided by 5 is 66. So, 330 pencils were used. So, 330 pencils were used after two months.

So, the remaining pencils after two months would be the total minus the used ones. So, 330 - 330=0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 330 pencils in total, 1/5 of them were used. So, 1/5 of 330 is 66, so 330 -66=264. Wait, so 264 pencils left after two months.

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the initial total. Let me double-check. 30 students, each with 10 pencils. 30*10=300 pencils. Wait, 30*10 is 300, not 330. I think I made a mistake there. So, 30 students, each with 10 pencils: 30*10=300 pencils.

So, total pencils at the start: 300.

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, 1/5 of 300 is 60. So, 60 pencils were used. Therefore, remaining pencils after two months: 300 -60=240.

So, 240 pencils left after two months.

Then, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, 1/3 of 240 is... Let me compute that. 240 divided by 3 is 80. So, 80 pencils were left at the end of the year.

Wait, so the answer is 80? Hmm, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Start: 30 students, each with 10 pencils. So, 30*10=300 pencils.

After two months: 1/5 of 330 is used. 1/5 of 330 is 66.6, but that can't be. Wait, 330 divided by 5 is 66. So, 66 pencils were used. So, 330 -66=264.

Wait, but 330 is 330, so 330 divided by 5 is 66.6,
