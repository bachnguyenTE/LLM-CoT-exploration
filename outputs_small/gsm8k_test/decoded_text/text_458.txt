Q: Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs and the number of puppies with spots. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. That seems straightforward. So, for Jennifer's dog, the number of spotted puppies is 3 out of 8. I can write that as a fraction: 3/8. Maybe I can convert that to a percentage later on.

Then, Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So, similar idea here. 4 out of 12 puppies have spots. That fraction is 4/12. Hmm, I can simplify that, right? Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4. So, 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, that simplifies to 1/3. Okay, so Brandon's dog has 1/3 of its puppies with spots.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of all the puppies that have spots. So, I think I need to combine both dogs' spotted puppies and then find the total number of puppies, and then calculate the percentage.

Let me add up the spotted puppies first. Jennifer has 3, and Brandon has 4. So, 3 plus 4 is 7. So, there are 7 spotted puppies in total.

Now, how many puppies are there altogether? Jennifer's dog has 8, and Brandon's has 12. So, 8 plus 12 is 20. Wait, 8 plus 12 is 20? No, that's not right. 8 plus 12 is 20? Wait, 8 plus 12 is 20? No, 8 plus 12 is 20? Wait, 8 plus 10 is 18, plus 2 is 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, total number of puppies is 20.

So, out of 20 puppies, 7 have spots. So, the fraction is 7/20. Hmm, can I simplify that? 7 and 20, both are divisible by 7? Wait, 20 divided by 7 is not a whole number. Wait, 7 times 2 is 14, 7 times 3 is 21, which is more than 20. So, no, 7 and 20 don't have a common divisor other than 1. So, 7/20 is the simplified fraction.

Now, to find the percentage, I need to convert 7/20 into a percentage. I know that to convert a fraction to a percentage, I can multiply it by 100. So, 7/20 times 100. Let me compute that.

First, 7 divided by 20. Let me do that division. 20 goes into 7 zero times. So, 0., and then 20 goes into 70 three times because 20 times 3 is 60. Subtract 60 from 70, we get 10. Bring down the next 0, making it 100. 20 goes into 100 five times because 20 times 5 is 100. Subtract, we get 0. So, 7 divided by 20 is 0.35. So, 0.35 times 100 is 35%. So, 35%.

Wait, let me double-check that. 20 times 0.35 is 7, right? 20 times 0.3 is 6.6, and 20 times 0.05 is 1. So, 6.6 plus 1 is 7.6? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 20 times 0.35 is 7. So, 20 times 0.35 is 7. So, 7 divided by 20 is 0.35, which is 35%. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together: Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted out of 8, which is 3/8 or 37.5%. Brandon's dog has 4 spotted out of 12, which is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. But when we combine both, it's 7 spotted out of 20 total, which is 35%.

Wait, so is 35% the correct answer? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding or something.

So, 3
