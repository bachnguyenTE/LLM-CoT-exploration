Q: Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Marcy making candles, and I need to figure out how many of her 50,000 candles will both smell like a wet dog and explode. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Marcy makes candles that are 99% guaranteed not to explode. So, out of 50,000 candles, 99% won't explode. That means 1% might explode, right? Let me calculate that. 1% of 50,000 is... well, 1% is 0.01, so 55,000 multiplied by 0.01. Let me do that math: 55,000 * 0.01 is 5,500. So, 5,500 candles might explode.

But wait, the problem also mentions that 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like a wet dog. So, out of all the candles that might explode, 5% of them also have that smell issue. So, I need to find 5% of the 5,500 that might explode.

Let me write that down: 5% of 5,500. To calculate that, I can convert 5% to a decimal, which is 0.05, and then multiply it by 5,5000. So, 5,500 * 0.05. Hmm, 5,500 * 0.05. Let me think, 5,500 * 0.05 is the same as half of 5,500, right? So, half of 5,500 is 2,750. So, 2,750 candles might both explode and smell like a wet dog.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 5% of 5,500 is 2,750. That seems right because 10% of 5,500 is 550, so 5% is half of that, which is 2,750. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, putting it all together: Marcy makes 55,000 candles. 99% are safe, so 1% might explode, which is 5,500. Then, 5% of those 5,500 might also smell like a wet dog. So, 5% of 5,500 is 2,750. Therefore, 2,750 candles will both explode and smell like a wet dog.

Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says "5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like a wet dog." So, does that mean that 5% of all candles, regardless of their danger, have that defect? Or is it specifically 5% of the dangerous ones? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Let me read it again: "5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like a wet dog." So, it's 5% of the more dangerous candles, which are the ones that might explode. So, that part is correct. So, 5% of the 5,500 that might explode is 2,750.

So, I think my initial calculation is correct. So, the answer should be 2,750.

But just to make sure, let me think about the percentages again. 99% are safe, so 1% might explode. 5% of those 1% might also have the smell defect. So, 1% is 5,500, 5% of that is 2,750. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of probabilities: The probability that a candle explodes is 1%, and given that it explodes, the probability that it also smells like a wet dog is 5%. So, the joint probability is 1% * 5% = 0.5%. So, 0.5% of 55,000 is 2,750. Yep, that's the same result.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 2,750.

**Final Answer**
The number of candles that will both smell like a wet dog and explode is \boxed{2750}.

Marcy makes 55,000 candles. 99% of these candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them might explode. 

First, we calculate 1% of 55,
