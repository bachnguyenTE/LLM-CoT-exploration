A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount Gus spent at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the known items. The two bags of chips cost 2 multiplied by $2.00, which equals $4.00. Adding the cost of the fried chicken and soda, the total expenditure is $4.00 plus $8.00 plus $1.00, totaling $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, I'll subtract the amount he spent on the chips, fried chicken, and soda from this total to find out how much he spent on the apple pie. Subtracting $13.00 from $20.00 leaves $7.00.

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

**Solution:**

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. Let's break down the costs of the items he bought:

1. **2 Bags of Chips:**  
   Each bag costs \$2.00, so  
   \[
   2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00
   \]

2. **Bucket of Fried Chicken:**  
   This costs \$8.00.

3. **Bottle of Soda:**  
   This costs \$1.0.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent on these items:

\[
\$4.00 \, (\text{chips}) + \$8.00 \, (\text{fried chicken}) + \$1.00 \, (\text{soda}) = \$13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00. To find out how much he spent on the **apple pie**, subtract the total spent on the other items from the overall total:

\[
\$20.00 \, (\text{total}) - \$13.00 \, (\text{other items}) = \$7.00
\]

**Answer:**  
\boxed{\$7.00}
