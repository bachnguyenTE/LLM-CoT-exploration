Q: John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his speed talking. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John normally speaks at 150 WPM. Hmm, WPM stands for words per minute, right? So that's his speaking speed without any training. Then, after training, his speed becomes 2.5 times faster. I need to find out how long it would take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words. 

Alright, let me break this down. I think I need to calculate his new speaking speed after training and then figure out how long it takes him to transcribe 10 pages at that speed. 

Starting with his original speed: 150 WPM. Wait, no, it's 150 WPM. So that's 150 words per minute. Then, after training, he's 2.5 times faster. So I need to multiply his original speed by 2.5 to get his new speed. 

Let me write that down: New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5. Hmm, 150 times 2.5. Let me calculate that. 150 * 2 is 300, and 150 * 0.5 is 75. So adding those together, 300 + 75 is 375. So his new speed is 375 WPM. Okay, that makes sense. He's now speaking 375 words per minute after training.

Now, each page has 450 words. So, if he needs to speak 10 pages, how many words is that in total? I think I need to multiply the number of pages by the words per page. So, 10 pages * 450 words/page. Let me compute that. 10 * 450 is 4500. So, he needs to speak 4500 words in total.

Now, he speaks at 375 WPM, which is 375 words per minute. So, to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words, I need to divide the total number of words by his speaking speed. So, time = total words / words per minute. 

Calculating that: 4500 words / 375 WPM. Let me do this division. 375 goes into 4500 how many times? Hmm, 375 * 10 is 3750, which is less than 4500. 375 * 12 is 4500. Wait, 375 * 12 is 4500? Let me check: 375 * 10 is 3750, plus 375 *2 is 750, so 3750 + 750 is 4500. Yes, that's correct. So, 375 *12 = 4500. So, 4500 / 375 is 12 minutes. 

Wait, so does that mean it takes him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages? That seems a bit long, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my calculations.

Original speed: 150 WPM. After training, 2.5 times faster: 150 * 2.5. 150 *2 is 300, 150 *0.5 is 75, so 375. That's correct. 

Total words: 10 pages *450 words/page. 10*450 is 4500. Correct. 

Time: 4500 /375. 375*12 is 4500, so 12 minutes. Yeah, that seems right. 

Wait, but 12 minutes is 12 minutes, which is 0.2 hours. But the question didn't specify the unit, just asked for how long. So, 12 minutes is the answer. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of minutes per word? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of how many words he can speak in a minute and then how many minutes per page.

But I think the way I did it is straightforward: total words divided by words per minute. So, 4500 /375 is 12 minutes. 

Wait, let me just verify the multiplication again. 375 *12 is 750, but wait,
