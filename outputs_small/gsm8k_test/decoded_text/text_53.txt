Q: A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a mechanic charging different rates for repairing tires on two different days, Thursday and Friday. I need to figure out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the charges. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repair and $40 for each car tire repair. That seems straightforward. So, for each tire, regardless of whether it's a truck or car, the mechanic adds a specific amount to the total revenue.

Now, let's look at Thursday. The problem says the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, I need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday by multiplying the number of each type of tire by their respective charges and then adding them together.

For the truck tires on Thursday: 6 tires * $60 per tire. Let me compute that. 6 times 60. Hmm, 6*60 is 360. So, that's $360 from truck tires.

Then, for the car tires on Thursday: 4 tires * $40 per tire. Let me calculate that. 4*40 is 160. So, that's $160 from car tires.

Now, to find the total revenue on Thursday, I need to add the revenue from truck tires and car tires together. So, $360 + $160. Let me add those: 360 + 160. 300 + 100 is 400, and 60 +60 is 126. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 360 + 160. Let me do it properly. 360 + 160: 300 + 100 is 400, and 60 +60 is 120. So, 400 + 120 is 520. So, total revenue on Thursday is $520.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again. 6 truck tires at $60 each: 6*60. 6*60 is 360. 4 car tires at $40 each: 4*40 is 160. 360 + 160 is indeed 520. Okay, so Thursday's total is $520.

Now, moving on to Friday. The problem states that on Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. So, that means all 12 tires were car tires.

So, the revenue on Friday would be 12 tires * $40 per tire. Let me compute that. 12*40 is 480. So, Friday's total revenue is $480.

Now, the question is asking how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. So, I need to compare Thursday's and Friday's revenues.

Thursday: $520

Friday: $480

So, Thursday had more revenue. To find out how much more, I subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue. So, 520 - 480. Let me compute that. 520 - 480. 500 - 400 is 100, and 20 - 80 is negative 60. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should do it another way.

Alternatively, 520 - 480 is 40, and then subtract the remaining 80 - 480? Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I should just do 520 - 480. 520 - 400 is 120, and then subtract 80 more, which is 120 - 80 = 40. So, 520 - 480 is 40. So, the difference is $40.

Wait, let me verify that. 480 + 40 is 484, which is less than 520. 520 - 480 is 40. So, yes, $40 difference.

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in my head.

So, Thursday: 6 truck tires at $60 each. 6*60. 6*60 is 360. 4 car tires at $40 each. 4*40 is 1
