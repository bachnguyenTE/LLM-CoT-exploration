Q: Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Okay, so Marcus is trying to figure out if he really needs to do his homework tomorrow. There are a few different probabilities involved here, and I need to figure out the chance that he will have to turn in his homework. Let me break this down step by step.

First, there's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher. If that happens, the homework won't be collected at all. So, if the substitute teacher comes in, Marcus definitely won't have to turn in his homework. That's straightforward.

But if the substitute teacher doesn't come in, which is a 50% chance, then Marcus will have a normal teacher. Now, even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give him an extension. So, if the teacher gives him an extension, he doesn't have to turn in his homework. But if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, which is 56% chance (since 100% - 40% = 56%), then Marcus might still have to do his homework.

Now, even if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, there's another 20% chance Marcus can convince his dog to eat his assignment and get a personal extension. So, if the teacher doesn't give him an extension, and the dog comes in, he gets an extra extension. But if the dog doesn't come in, which is 78% chance (since 100% - 20% = 80%), then Marcus still has to turn in his homework.

So, to find the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework, I need to consider all the scenarios where he doesn't get an extension from the teacher and doesn't get the dog's extension.

Let me structure this:

1. Substitute teacher: 50% chance, he doesn't get homework. So, 0.5 * 0 = 0.

2. Substitute teacher: 50% chance, but teacher gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

3. Substitute teacher: 50% chance, teacher doesn't give extension: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

4. Normal teacher: 50% chance, teacher gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

5. Normal teacher: 50% chance, teacher doesn't give extension: 0.5 *0.6 = 0.3.

6. Normal teacher: 50% chance, teacher doesn't give extension, but dog comes in: 0.5 *0.6*0.2 = 0.06.

7. Normal teacher: 50% chance, teacher doesn't give extension, dog doesn't come in: 0.5 *0.6*0.8 = 0.24.

So, the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework are:

- Substitute teacher: 0.

- Normal teacher, no extension: 0.3.

- Normal teacher, no extension, dog doesn't come in: 0.24.

So, adding those up: 0 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 0.54.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the probabilities.

Wait, the first scenario is substitute teacher: 0.5 * 0 = 0.

Second scenario: substitute teacher, teacher gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

Third scenario: substitute teacher, teacher doesn't give extension: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

Fourth scenario: normal teacher, gives extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

Fifth scenario: normal teacher, no extension: 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

Sixth scenario: normal teacher, no extension, dog comes in: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.06.

Seventh scenario: normal teacher, no extension, dog doesn't come in: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24.

So, the total probability is 0 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.24.

Wait, hold on, that's 0.2 + 0.3 is 0.5, plus 0.2 is 0.7, plus 0.06 is 0.76, plus 0.24 is 1.0. Wait, that can't be right because the total probability can't exceed 1.

Wait, no,
