Q: Jeff’s work is 3 miles away.  He walks there and back each day he works.  How many miles does he walk if he has to work 5 times a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Jeff walks to work and back each day he works, and he has to work 5 times a week. The question is asking how many miles he walks in total during the week. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jeff's work is 3 miles away. So, each day, he walks 3 miles to get to work and then another 3 miles to come back home. That means each day, he walks a total of 3 miles there plus 3 miles back. So, that's 3 + 3, which is 6 miles per day. Is that right? Yeah, because 3 miles each way, so 3 times 2 is 6. So, he walks 6 miles each day.

Now, he works 5 times a week. So, each day he walks 6 miles, and he does this 5 times. So, to find the total miles he walks in a week, I need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works. That would be 6 miles/day multiplied by 5 days. Let me write that down: 6 * 5.

Calculating that, 6 times 5 is 30. So, does that mean he walks 30 miles in a week? Wait, 6 times 5 is 30, right? Yeah, 6*5 is 30. So, 30 miles in total.

Let me just double-check my reasoning. Each day, he walks 3 miles each way, so 3 + 3 = 6 miles. Then, he does this 5 times a week, so 6 * 5 = 30 miles. That seems correct.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe. Let's see. If he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, that's 6 miles each day. So, over 5 days, it's 5 times 6, which is 30. Yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 2 times 3 miles each day, which is 6, and then 5 times that. So, 2*3*5. 2*3 is 6, 6*5 is 30. So, same result.

Wait, another way: 3 miles each way, so 3*2=6 per day. 6 per day times 5 days is 30. Yeah, that's the same as before.

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 30 miles.

But just to make sure, let me visualize it. If he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, that's 6 miles each day. So, over 5 days, that's 6*5=30. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just a multiplication of of the daily distance by the number of working days. So, 6 miles times 5 days is 30 miles.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 30 miles.

**Final Answer**
The total miles Jeff walks in a week is \boxed{30}.

Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, which totals 6 miles per day. He works 5 times a week, so we need to calculate the total miles he walks in 5 days.

First, we find the daily distance:
\[ 3 \text{ miles (to work)} + 3 \text{ miles (back home)} = 6 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we multiply the daily distance by the number of working days:
\[ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is \(\boxed{30}\).
