Q: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon.  She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Grandma Jones baking apple pies for a fireman's luncheon. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says she baked 5 apple pies. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, I think I need to find out how many pieces of pie there were in total before anyone took them. Since each pie is cut into 8 pieces, and there are 5 pies, I can multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie. That should give me the total number of pie pieces.

So, 5 pies multiplied by 8 pieces per pie. Let me write that down: 5 * 8. Hmm, 5 times 8 is 40. So, there were 40 pieces of pie in total before the guests started eating.

Then, the problem says that after the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. So, that means that some pieces were taken by the guests. I need to find out how many pieces were taken. 

To find out how many pieces were taken, I can subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. So, that would be 40 total pieces minus 14 remaining pieces. Let me do that subtraction: 40 - 14. 

Hmm, 40 minus 10 is 49, and then minus another 4 is 45. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. 40 minus 10 is 30, but since it's 14, which is 10 plus 4, so 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 is 29. Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I should just do it straight.

40 minus 14: 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 more is 26. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me do it properly. 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 is 26. So, 40 -14 is 36, and 36 -10 is 26. So, 40 -14 is 36, and 36 -10 is 26. So, 40 -14 is 36, and 36 -10 is 26. So, 40 -14 is 36, and 36 -10 is 26. So, 40 -14 is 26. Wait, that seems off because 14 is 10 +4, so 40 -10 is 30, and 30 -4 is 26. Yeah, that's correct. So, 40 -14 is 26.

So, that means 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests. So, the answer should be 26.

Wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces: 5*8=40. Remaining pieces:14. So, 40-14=26. Wait, hold on, 40-14 is 26? Wait, 40-10 is 30, 30-4 is 26. So, yes, 26. So, 26 pieces were taken.

Wait, but hold on, 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so 5*8=40. If 14 are left, then 40-14=26. So, 26 pieces taken. So, the answer is 26.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. It says "how many pieces were taken by the guests?" So, 40 total, 14 remaining, so 40-14=26. So, 26 pieces taken. So, 26 is the answer.

Wait, but 26 seems a bit low. Let me see. 5 pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so 40 pieces. If 14 are left, that's 14 out of 40. So, 14 is a significant portion, so 26 taken is a lot. Wait, 14 out of 40 is 35%, so 26 is 6.5% of 40. That seems correct.

Wait, 14 out of 40 is 35%, so 26 is 6.5% of 40. So, that seems
