Okay, so Tim is getting a promotion that gives him a 5% raise on his current $20000 monthly salary. Plus, he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. I need to figure out how much he'll make in a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out what his new monthly salary will be after the 5% raise. His current salary is $20000, right? So, a 5% raise means he's getting 5% of $20000 added to his current salary. Let me calculate that.

5% of $20000 is... well, 10% is $2000, so 5% would be 5 times that. Let me do the math: 5 * $20000. Hmm, 5 * 20000. Let me compute that. 5 * 20000 is 100000. So, $10000. So, the raise is $10000. Therefore, his new monthly salary after the raise is his original salary plus the raise. So, $200000 + $10000 = $30000. Okay, so his new monthly salary is $30000.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 5% of 20000 is indeed 10000, so adding that to 20000 gives 30000. Yeah, that's correct. So, his new monthly salary is $30000.

Now, he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. So, half a month's salary is half of $30000. Let me calculate that. Half of 30000 is 15000. So, his bonus is $15000.

So, in total, his monthly income after the raise and bonus is his new salary plus the bonus. That would be $30000 + $15000. Let me add those up. 30000 + 15000 is 35000, and then plus another 1000 is 36000. So, his total monthly income is $36000.

Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 5% of 20000 is 1000, so 20000 + 1000 is 21000. Then, 5% of 21000 is 1050, so 21000 + 1050 is 22150. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, hold on, maybe I confused the steps.

Wait, no, actually, the raise is 5% of the original salary, which is 20000, so 5% is 1000, so 20000 + 1000 is 21000. Then, the bonus is half a month's salary, which is half of 21000, which is 1050. So, his total monthly income is 21000 + 1050, which is 22050. Wait, that's different from before. So, which one is correct?

Wait, I think I messed up the order of operations. Let me clarify. The raise is 5% of his current salary, which is 20000. So, 5% of 20000 is 10000, so his new salary is 22000. Then, the bonus is half a month's salary, which is half of 22000, which is 11000. So, his total monthly income is 22000 + 11000, which is 33000.

Wait, so now I'm confused because I got two different results. Let me figure out where I went wrong.

First approach: 5% of 20000 is 1000, so new salary is 21000. Then, half of 21000 is 10550. So, total is 21000 + 10550 = 31550. Hmm, that's not right either.

Wait, no, hold on
