Q: Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for a batch of suckers and 70 ounces for a batch of fudge. The question is asking how much sugar he needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how much sugar is required for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch is 30 ounces, I can multiply 30 by 8. Let me write that down: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces. So, that's the sugar needed for the suckers part.

Next, I need to calculate the sugar required for 1 batch of fudge. The problem says he needs 70 ounces for one batch, so that's straightforward. 70 ounces is the amount for 1 batch. So, no multiplication needed here, just 70 ounces.

Now, to find the total sugar needed, I should add the two amounts together. That would be 240 ounces (for the suckers) plus 70 ounces (for the fudge). Let me add those: 240 + 70. Hmm, 240 plus 70 is 310. So, the total sugar needed is 310 ounces.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the suckers: 30 times 8. 30*8, let's do it step by step. 30*8 is 240, right? Yeah, because 30*8 is 240, and 3*8 is 24, so 240. That seems correct.

For the fudge, it's 70 ounces for 1 batch. So, that's just 70. Adding that to 240: 240 + 70. 240 + 70 is 310, and then plus the remaining 0 is 310? Wait, no, 240 + 70. Let me add the units place: 0 + 0 is 0. Tens place: 4 +7 is 11, so carry over 1. Hundreds place: 2 +0 is 2, plus the carried over 1 is 3. So, 310. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, no, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, 240 +70 is 317? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 240 +70. Let's break it down: 240 +70. 200 +70 is 270, plus 40 is 310. So, 240 +70 is 310? Wait, that can't be right because 240 +70 is 317? Wait, no, 240 +70 is 240 +70. Wait, 240 +70 is 240 +70. 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 240 +70. 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 317? Wait, 240 +70 is 240, plus 7 is 247, plus 0 is 247. Wait, no, 240 +70 is 240 +70. 240 +70 is 310, plus 0 is 310? Wait, no, 240 +7
