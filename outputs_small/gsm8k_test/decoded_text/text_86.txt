Q: Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?

Okay, so I have this problem about Greg's alarm. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says Greg has an alarm that rings three times a day. When it goes off, it continues ringing until Greg turns it off. 

On the first time it went off, it rang four times. Then, the second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. The question is asking how many times did the alarm ring in all.

Wait, hold on. The first time it went off, it rang four times. So that's the first ring. Then, the second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Hmm, so does that mean the duration of the second ring is three times the duration of the first ring? Or is it the number of rings? The wording is a bit confusing.

Let me read it again: "The first time it went off, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time." So, the first ring was four times, meaning four rings. The second time, the duration was three times as long as the first time. So, if the first ring was four times, the second ring was three times that duration, which would be 4 * 3 = 12 rings? Wait, that doesn't make sense because rings are events, not durations.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the duration of the second ring is three times the duration of the first ring. So, if the first ring was four seconds, the second ring would be 12 seconds. But the problem doesn't specify the duration of the first ring, so maybe I need to figure that out.

Wait, no, the problem says the first time it went off, it rang four times. So, that's four rings. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, if the first time was four rings, the second time would be 3 * 4 = 12 rings? But that seems like the duration is increasing, but the number of rings is the same? Or is the duration the number of rings?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The problem says, "the first time it went off, it rang four times." So, that's four rings. Then, "the second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time." So, if the first time was four rings, the second time would be 3 * 4 = 12 rings? But that would mean the second time it went off, it rang 12 times, which is three times as long as the first time. But that seems a bit confusing because rings are events, not durations.

Alternatively, maybe the duration of the second ring is three times the duration of the first ring. So, if the first ring was, say, 4 seconds, the second ring would be 12 seconds. But again, the number of rings is the same, so the total number of rings would be 4 + 12 + something.

Wait, but the problem is asking how many times did the alarm ring in all. So, it's not about the duration, but the number of rings. So, the first time, it rang four times. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, if the first time was four rings, the second time would be 3 * 4 = 12 rings? But that would mean the second time it went off, it rang 12 times, which is three times as long as the first time. But that seems like the duration is increasing, but the number of rings is the same.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the problem again.

Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?

So, the alarm rings three times a day. So, each day, it rings three times. But the problem is talking about the first time, second time, third time. So, each time it rings, it rings three times. So, each ring is a separate event.

Wait, but the first time it went off, it rang four times. So, that's four rings. Then, the second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, if the first time was four rings, the second time would be 3 * 4 =
