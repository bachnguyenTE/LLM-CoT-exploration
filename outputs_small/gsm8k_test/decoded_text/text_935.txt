Q: Fern is trying to decide between buying the Widgeteer 3000, which makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000, which makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6. How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days?

First, I need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each widget machine over the month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It produces 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.
- So, the total widgets are 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 4,320 widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It produces 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day for 30 days.
- So, the total widgets are 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 3,240 widgets.

Next, I'll calculate the total revenue from each machine by multiplying the number of widgets by the selling price of $6 per widget.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Revenue = 4,320 widgets * $6/widget = $25,920.

For the WidgetMaster 9900:
- Revenue = 3,240 widgets * $6/widget = $19,440.

Finally, to find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 will make compared to the WidgetMaster 9900, I'll subtract the revenue of the latter from the revenue of the former.

Difference = $25,920 - $19,440 = $6,480.

To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9900, we'll follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Widgets Produced by Each Machine**

**Widgeteer 3000:**
- **Production Rate:** 60 widgets per hour
- **Operating Hours per Day:** 24 hours
- **Days in Month:** 30 days

\[
\text{Total Widgets (Widgeteer 3000)} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 4,\!320 \, \text{widgets}
\]

**WidgetMaster 9900:**
- **Production Rate:** 45 widgets per hour
- **Operating Hours per Day:** 24 hours
- **Days in Month:** 30 days

\[
\text{Total Widgets (WidgetMaster 9900)} = 45 \, \! \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \! \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3,\!240 \, \text{widgets}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue from Each Machine**

Each widget sells for **\$6**.

\[
\text{Revenue (Widgeteer 3000)} = 4,\!320 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$25,\!920
\]

\[
\text{Revenue (WidgetMaster 9900)} = 3,\!240 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$19,\!440
\]

### **Step 3: Determine the Difference in Revenue**

\[
\text{Difference} = \$25,\!920 - \$19,\!440 = \$6,\!480
\]

### **Final Answer**

Fern will make **\$6,480** more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9900.

\[
\boxed{\$6,\!480}
\]
