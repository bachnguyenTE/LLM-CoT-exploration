Okay, so I have this problem here: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade at their lemonade stand. Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three people: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell. Together, they sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. The other two, Micah and Mitchell, sold an equal number of glasses. So, I need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.

Alright, so let's break this down. The total number of glasses sold is 32. Julie sold 14, so that means the remaining glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together would be 32 minus 14. Let me write that down:

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together = 32 - 14

Calculating that, 32 minus 14 is... let me do the subtraction. 32 minus 10 is 31, minus 4 more is 28. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 32 minus 10 is 22, then minus 4 is 18. Hmm, no, that's not correct either. Wait, maybe I should just do it straight.

32
-14

Starting from the right, 2 minus 4 can't do that, so I need to borrow from the tens place. So, 12 minus 4 is 8. Then, the tens place: 2 minus 1 is 1. So, 32 minus 14 is 18. Yeah, that's right. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses.

But wait, the problem says they sold an equal number of glasses. So, both Micah and Mitchell sold the same number. So, if together they sold 18 glasses, each of them must have sold half of that. So, 18 divided by 2 is 4. So, each of them sold 4 glasses.

Wait, hold on, 18 divided by 2 is 4? Wait, 2 times 4 is 8, yes. So, Micah sold 4 glasses, and Mitchell sold 4 glasses.

So, now, the question is, how many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah? Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 4 glasses. So, 14 minus 4 is 0. So, Julie didn't sell any more glasses than Micah.

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me double-check my calculations. So, total glasses sold: 32. Julie sold 14. So, 32 minus 14 is 18. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold 18. Since they sold equal numbers, each sold 9? Wait, hold on, wait, 18 divided by 2 is 4, not 9. Wait, 18 divided by 2 is 9, but 18 is the total for both. So, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, each sold 9 glasses.

Wait, hold on, now I'm confused. Let me go back.

Wait, 32 total. Julie sold 14. So, 32 minus 14 is 18. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold 18. So, each sold half of that, which is 4. So, 4 each. So, Julie sold 14, Micah sold 4, so 14 minus 4 is 10. So, Julie sold 10 more than Micah.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, which is it?

Wait, let me clarify. The total sold by Micah and Mitchell is 18, so each sold 9. So, that would mean Micah sold 9, and Mitchell sold 9. So, Julie sold 14, so 14 minus 9 is 5. So, Julie sold 5 more than Micah.

Wait, so which is correct? 18 divided by 2 is 9, or 32 minus 14 is 18, so 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, that would mean Micah and Mitchell each sold 9. So, Julie sold 14, so 14 minus 9 is 5.

Wait, so which
