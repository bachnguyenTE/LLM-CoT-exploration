Q: Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Greg is putting clean sheets on different beds every week. Specifically, he's using 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed each week. So, that's a total of 5 beds. Now, each of these beds has multiple sheets, right? I think each twin bed has 2 sides, so that's 2 sheets per twin bed. And the king size bed has 2 sides as well, so that's 2 sheets. So, let me calculate the total number of sheets he uses each week.

For the twin beds: 4 beds * 2 sheets each = 8 sheets. For the king bed: 1 bed * 2 sheets = 2 sheets. So, adding those together, Greg uses 8 + 2 = 10 sheets per week. Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay, let's go with that for now.

Now, his laundry machine can only handle 2 sets of twin sheets at a time and 1 set of king sheets at a time. Hmm, so each load is a combination of twin sets and a king set. I need to figure out how many such combinations he can make each week and then extrapolate that to a year.

First, let's break down the sheets into twin and king sets. Each twin set is 2 sheets, and each king set is 2 sheets. So, Greg uses 8 twin sheets and 2 king sheets each week. But his machine can only process 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets at a time.

Wait, so each load is 2 twin sets and 1 king set. So, each load requires 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets. Each set is 2 sheets, so each twin set is 2 sheets, and each king set is 2 sheets.

So, each load requires 2 * 2 = 4 twin sheets and 1 * 2 = 2 king sheets.

But Greg uses 8 twin sheets and 2 king sheets each week. So, how many loads can he do each week?

Let me think. Each load takes away 4 twin sheets and 2 king sheets. So, how many times can he do this with 8 twin sheets? 8 / 4 = 2. Similarly, with 2 king sheets, he can do 2 / 2 = 1. So, the number of loads is limited by the smaller number, which is 1. So, he can do 1 load each week.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check. Each load requires 2 twin sets and 1 king set. Each twin set is 2 sheets, so 2 sets would be 4 sheets. Each king set is 2 sheets, so 1 set is 2 sheets. So, each load is 4 twin sheets and 2 king sheets.

Greg uses 8 twin sheets and 2 king sheets each week. So, for twin sheets: 8 / 4 = 2 loads. For king sheets: 2 / 2 = 1 load. So, the limiting factor is the king sheets, so he can only do 1 load per week.

But wait, is that correct? Because each load is 2 twin sets and 1 king set, so each load is 4 twin sheets and 2 king sheets. So, in one week, he uses 8 twin sheets and 2 king sheets. So, he can do 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets. But since he can't do both at the same time, he can only do the one that uses fewer loads. So, he can only do 1 load per week because the king sheets only allow 1 load, while the twin sheets allow 2 loads.

So, that means each week, he does 1 load. Therefore, in a year, how many weeks are there? 52 weeks. So, 52 loads per year.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the machine can handle multiple loads at the same time? The problem says his laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. So, does that mean he can do 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one go, or does it mean he can do 2 loads of twin sets and 1 load of king sets?

I think it's the latter. So, each load is 2 twin sets and 1 king set. So, each load is a single operation. So, each week, he can do 1 load because the king sheets only allow 1 load, while the twin sheets allow 2 loads. So, he can
