Q: Joey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble. He scores 26 points. Then Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. By how many points is Joey now winning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Joey and Marcy scoring points in Scrabble. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Joey has 214 points before his turn. Then he scores 26 points. So, I think I need to add those two amounts together to find out how many points Joey has after his turn. Let me write that down:

214 (Joey's initial points) + 26 (his score) = ?

Hmm, 214 plus 26. Let me do the addition. 214 plus 20 is 234, and then plus 6 is 240. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. 214 plus 26 should be 240? Wait, 214 plus 20 is 234, plus 6 is 240. Yeah, that's correct. So Joey now has 240 points.

Then, the problem mentions Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. So, I need to add Marcy's points to her current points. Let me write that:

225 (Marcy's initial points) + 10 (her score) = ?

225 plus 10 is 235. That seems straightforward. So Marcy now has 235 points.

Wait, the question is asking by how many points Joey is now winning. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means. Is it the difference between Joey's points and Marcy's points? Or is it something else?

Let me read the question again: "By how many points is Joey now winning?" So, I think it's asking how many more points Joey has than Marcy. So, I need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points.

So, Joey has 240 points, Marcy has 235 points. So, 240 minus 235 is... let me calculate that. 240 minus 200 is 240, minus 35 is 205. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it step by step.

240 minus 235:

Start from the units place: 0 minus 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. So, 10 minus 5 is 5. Then, the tens place is now 3 (since we borrowed 1), so 3 minus 3 is 0. The hundreds place is 2 minus 2, which is 0. So, the result is 5. Wait, that can't be right because 240 minus 235 is 5? That seems too small. Wait, no, 235 plus 5 is 240, so yes, that's correct. So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

First, Joey's points: 214 + 26. Let me add 214 + 26. 214 + 20 is 234, plus 6 is 240. That's correct.

Marcy's points: 225 + 10. 225 + 10 is 235. Correct.

Difference: 240 - 235. Let's do it another way. 240 - 235. 240 minus 200 is 40, minus 35 is 5. So, 5 points. So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "By how many points is Joey now winning?" So, is it 5 points? Or is it something else?

Alternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.

"By how many points is Joey now winning?" Hmm, maybe it's asking how many points Joey has more than Marcy, which is 5 points. So, the answer is 5.

But let me think again. Maybe the question is asking for the difference in their scores, which is 5. So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Alternatively, maybe it's asking how many points Joey has after his turn, which is 240, and how many points Marcy has, which is 235, so the difference is 5. So, yeah, 5 points.

Wait, but the initial problem says "By how many points is Joey now winning?" So, maybe it's the difference between Joey's current points and Marcy's current points, which is 5. So, the answer is 5.

Alternatively, maybe
