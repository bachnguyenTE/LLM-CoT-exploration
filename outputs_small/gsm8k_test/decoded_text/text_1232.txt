Q: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Eve starts with 20 pomelos. She gives some to her friend, and after that, she has 1/4 of what she originally had. So, I need to find out how many she gave away.

Alright, so let's break it down. She originally had 20 pomelos. If she gives away some, she's left with 1/4 of 20. Let me calculate that first. 1/4 of 20 is... 20 divided by 4, which is 5. So, after giving some away, she has 5 pomelos left.

Wait, so she started with 20 and ended up with 5. That means she gave away 20 minus 5, which is 15. So, she gave away 15 pomelos? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up an equation to make sure. Let me denote the number of pomelos she gave away as x. So, the equation would be:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Calculating the right side, 1/4 of 20 is 5, so:

20 - x = 5

Then, solving for x, subtract 5 from both sides:

20 - 5 = x

Which gives x = 15. So, she gave away 15 pomelos. That matches my initial calculation.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using fractions or something else?

Alternatively, if she has 1/4 left, that means she gave away 3/4 of her original amount. So, 3/4 of 20 is... 20 multiplied by 3/4. Let me compute that: 20 * 3 = 60, divided by 4 is 15. So, 15 pomelos again. So, that's consistent.

Hmm, so both methods give me 15. So, that seems to be the answer.

But just to make sure, let me visualize it. She starts with 20. If she gives away 15, she's left with 15. 15 is 3/4 of 20, which is 15. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about the problem again. It says she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5, which is what she has left. So, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15. So, that's correct.

Is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check: "Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had." So, yes, that's 1/4 of 20, which is 5. So, 20 - 5 = 15. So, she gave away 15.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of fractions, 1/4 is the remaining, so 3/4 is given away. 3/4 of 20 is 15. So, same answer.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the problem in another way. Suppose she gave away x pomelos, so she has 20 - x left. And that equals 1/4 of 20, which is 5. So, 20 - x = 5. Solving for x, x = 20 - 5 = 15. So, same answer.

Alternatively, if I think about the ratio. She has 1/4 left, so the ratio of what she has to what she started with is 1/4. So, the ratio of what she gave away is 3/4. So, 3/4 of 20 is 15. So, she gave away 15.

Wait, but is there a possibility that the problem is saying she gave her friend some pomelos, but maybe she gave some to her friend and some to her other friend? But no, the problem says she gave her friend some, so it's just one friend. So, it's just one transaction.
