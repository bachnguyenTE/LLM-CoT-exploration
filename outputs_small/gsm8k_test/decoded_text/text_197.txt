Okay, so I have this problem here about the city of Soda. Let me read it again: there are 23,786 inhabitants in Soda. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. The rest are children. I need to find out how many kids there are in Soda. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but let me make sure I do this step by step.

First, I know that the total population is the sum of men, women, and children. So, if I have the total and the number of men and women, I can subtract those two from the total to get the number of children. That makes sense because if I add up all the men, women, and kids, it should equal the total population.

Let me write that down as an equation. Let me denote the number of children as C. So, the total population is 23,786, which is equal to the number of men plus the number of women plus the number of children. In symbols, that would be:

23,786 = 8,417 (men) + 9,092 (women) + C (children)

So, to find C, I need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. That is:

C = 23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092

Wait, hold on, the number of women is 9,092. Let me make sure I write that correctly. So, 23,786 minus 8,417 minus 9,092. Hmm, okay, let me do the subtraction step by step.

First, subtract the number of men from the total population. So, 23,786 minus 8,417. Let me compute that. 23,786 minus 8,417.

Let me break it down:

23,786
-8,417
________

Starting from the rightmost digit: 6 minus 7. Hmm, can't do that, so I need to borrow from the next digit. The 8 becomes 7, and the 6 becomes 16. 16 minus 7 is 9.

Next digit: 7 minus 1. Wait, the next digit is 7 (from 23,786) minus 4 (from 8,417). So, 7 minus 4 is 3.

Next digit: 3 minus 8. Hmm, can't do that. So, I need to borrow from the next digit. The next digit is 2 (from 23,786). So, 2 becomes 1, and the 3 becomes 13. 13 minus 8 is 5.

Next digit: 1 minus 0 is 1.

So, putting it all together, 23,786 minus 8,417 is 15,369. Let me check that: 8,417 plus 15,369 should equal 23,786.

8,417 + 15,369. Let's add them:

8,417
+15,369
________
23,786

Yes, that adds up correctly. So, 23,786 minus 8,417 is 15,369.

Now, I need to subtract the number of women, which is 9,092, from this result. So, 15,369 minus 9,092.

Let me write that down:

15,369
-9,092
________

Starting from the rightmost digit: 9 minus 2 is 7.

Next digit: 6 minus 9. Hmm, can't do that. So, I need to borrow from the next digit. The next digit is 3 (from 15,369). So, 3 becomes 2, and the 6 becomes 16. 16 minus 9 is 7.

Next digit: 2 minus 0 is 2.

Next digit: 5 minus 9. Hmm, can't do that. So, I need to borrow from the next digit. The next digit is 1 (from 15,369). So, 1 becomes 0, and the 5 becomes 15. 15 minus 9 is 6.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure. So, 15,369 minus 9,092.

Starting from the units place: 9 -
