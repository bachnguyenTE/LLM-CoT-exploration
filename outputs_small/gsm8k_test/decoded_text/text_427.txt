Okay, so I have this problem here about Kenny selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Kenny has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He wants to buy a ticket that costs $100. He also keeps 1/3 of the cards he sells and goes to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. The question is, how many cards did he start with?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Kenny is selling his cards, getting $1.5 per card. He sells some number of them, keeps 1/3 of those, and uses $50 for spending cash. He needs $100 for the amusement park ticket. So, I think I need to figure out how many cards he sold, then add the ones he kept to get the total he started with.

Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of cards he starts with is N. He sells some of them, let's say he sells S cards. So, the total money he gets from selling S cards is 1.5 * S dollars. 

He keeps 1/3 of the cards he sells, so he keeps (1/3) * S cards. But does he keep the value of those cards? Wait, the problem says he keeps 1/3 of them, but it doesn't specify if that's 1/3 of the number of cards or 1/3 of the money. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "He keeps 1/3 of them." So, it's 1/3 of the cards, not 1/3 of the money. So, he sells S cards, keeps (1/3)S cards, and uses the rest for spending cash. So, the money he keeps is 1.5 * (1/3)S, which is 0.5S dollars. 

He also has $50 in spending cash. So, the total money he has after selling and keeping some cards is the money from selling the cards plus the money he has in spending cash. So, that would be 1.5S + 50. 

But wait, he needs $100 for the amusement park ticket. So, the total money he has after selling and keeping some cards should be equal to $100. So, 1.5S + 50 = 100. 

Wait, let me write that equation down:

1.5S + 50 = 100

So, solving for S:

1.5S = 100 - 50
1.5S = 50
S = 55 / 1.5
S = 36.666...

Wait, that can't be right. He can't sell a fraction of a card. So, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Let me go back. Maybe the $50 is the amount he has in spending cash, so he uses that to buy the ticket. So, the total money he has is the money from selling the cards plus the spending cash, which is 1.5S + 50. This total should be equal to the ticket price, which is $100. So, 1.5S + 50 = 100. That's what I did before, which gives S = 36.666... So, that's not a whole number, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that he keeps 1/3 of the cards he sells, but the value of those cards is also part of his total. So, perhaps the total money he has is the money from selling the cards plus the value of the cards he keeps, plus the spending cash. But that seems like it would complicate things more.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash." So, he sells some cards, keeps 1/3 of them, and uses the rest for spending cash. So, the total money he has is the money from selling the cards plus the spending cash. So, 1.5S + 50 = 100. So, that's the same equation as before, which gives S = 36.666...

But that's not a whole number, so maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the $50 is the amount he has in spending cash, so he uses that to buy the ticket. So, the total money he has is the money from selling the cards plus the spending cash, which is 1
