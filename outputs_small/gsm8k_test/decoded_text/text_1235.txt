Q: Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?

Okay, so Michael is traveling on the interstate, and he's going at an average speed of 50 km per hour. He's doing this for 3 days, and the total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The question is asking what percentage of this distance he's covered. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how far Michael has traveled in total during those 3 days. Since he's traveling at a constant speed, I can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the time he's been traveling each day. It just says he's traveling for 3 days. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that he's traveling the same amount of time each day? Or perhaps the total time is 3 days? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, let me read the question again: "Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50 km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?"

So, it says he's traveling for 3 days, and the total distance is 6000 km. So, maybe the total time he's been traveling is 3 days? Or is it 3 days of driving? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me parse it again: "If he goes on like this for 3 days." So, he's going like this for 3 days, meaning he's driving for 3 days. So, the total time he's been driving is 3 days. So, I can calculate the total distance he's covered in 3 days by multiplying his speed by the total time.

But wait, the speed is given in km per hour, and the time is in days. I need to convert days into hours to make the units consistent. So, 3 days is equal to 3 × 24 hours, which is 72 hours.

So, total distance covered would be 55 km/hr × 72 hours. Let me calculate that.

55 × 72. Let's break it down: 50 × 72 = 3600, and 5 × 72 = 360. So, 3600 + 360 = 3960 km.

Wait, so he's covered 3960 km in 3 days. The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. So, to find the percentage he's covered, I can use the formula:

Percentage = (Distance Covered / Total Distance) × 100

So, plugging in the numbers: (3960 / 6000) × 100.

Let me compute 3960 divided by 6000 first. 3960 ÷ 6000. Hmm, 3960 ÷ 6000 is equal to 0.66. Because 6000 × 0.66 = 3960.

So, 0.66 × 100 = 66%. So, he's covered 66% of the distance.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 55 km/h for 72 hours: 55 × 72. 55 × 70 is 3850, and 55 × 2 is 110, so 3850 + 111 = 3961. Hmm, that's 3961 km, which is approximately 3960 km. So, 3960 divided by 6000 is indeed 0.66, which is 66%.

So, the percentage is 66%.

Wait, but let me make sure I interpreted the time correctly. The problem says he's going for 3 days, but it doesn't specify whether that's the total time or the daily time. But since the speed is given in km per hour, and the answer is a percentage, it's more likely that the 3 days refer to the total driving time, not the number of days he's been driving. So, 3 days of driving, each day for some time, totaling 3 days.

Alternatively, if it was 3 days of driving, each day for 24 hours, that would be 72 hours, which is what I did. So, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, if it was 3 days of driving, each day for a different number of hours, but since the speed is
