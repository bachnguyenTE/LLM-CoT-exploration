Q: Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour. How fast does the faster car go?

Okay, so Rani is obsessed with sports cars, and she's trying to figure out how fast the fastest car can go. She found out that this fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the speed of the second fastest car first, and then multiply that by 1.25 to get the speed of the fastest car. 

Let me break it down step by step. The problem says the second fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour. So, if the second car is 5 times faster than the average, that means I need to multiply 120 by 5 to get its speed.

Let me write that down: 120 mph * 5. Hmm, 120 times 5. Let me calculate that. 100 times 5 is 500, and 20 times 5 is 100, so adding those together, 500 + 100 is 6100. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 120 * 5. Let me do it more carefully. 100 *5 is 500, and 20*5 is 100, so 500 + 100 is 650. Oh, okay, so 120 *5 is 650. So the second fastest car goes 650 miles per hour.

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. So, I need to find 1.25 times 650. Hmm, 1.25 is the same as 5/4, right? So, 650 multiplied by 5/4. Alternatively, I can think of it as 650 + 1.25*650, but that might be more complicated. Maybe it's easier to just multiply 650 by 1.25.

Let me do 650 *1.25. Hmm, 650 *1 is 650, and 650 *0.25 is 162.5. So, adding those together, 650 + 162.5 is 812.5. So, the fastest car goes 812.5 miles per hour.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so 650 *5/4. Let me compute 650 divided by 4 first. 650 divided by 4 is 162.5, and then multiplied by 5 is 812.5. Yeah, that's the same as before. So, 812.5 mph. So, the fastest car goes 812.5 miles per hour.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, starting from the average car, which is 120 mph. The second fastest is 5 times that, so 120*5=650. Then, the fastest is 1.25 times the second, so 650*1.25=812.5. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of 1.25 as 1 + 0.25, so 650 + (650*0.25). 650*0.25 is 162.5, so 650 + 162.5 is 812.5. Yep, same result.

So, I think that's correct. The fastest car goes 812.5 mph. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It's straightforward once you break it down step by step.

**Final Answer**
The faster car goes \boxed{812.5} miles per hour.

Rani is trying to determine how fast the fastest sports car can go. She found out that this fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, and the second fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[
120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 650 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we calculate the speed of the fastest car, which is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car:
\[
650 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 =
