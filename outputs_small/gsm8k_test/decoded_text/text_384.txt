Q: Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially. He sold 3/5 of his land and was left with 12.8 hectares.

Let’s denote the initial amount of land as \( x \) hectares.

He sold \( \frac{3}{5}x \) hectares, so the remaining land is \( x - \frac{3}{5}x \).

This remaining land is equal to 12.8 hectares, so the equation is:
\[ x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Calculating the value:
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

Let's determine how much land Mr. Ruther had at first.

**Given:**
- Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land.
- After selling, he was left with 12.8 hectares.

**Let:**
- \( x \) = the initial amount of land in hectares.

**Step 1:** Calculate the remaining land after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of it.

\[
\text{Remaining land} = x - \frac{3}{5}x
\]

**Step2:** Simplify the equation.

\[
\text{Remaining land} = \frac{2}{5}x
\]

**Step3:** Set up the equation based on the given remaining land.

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

**Step4:** Solve for \( x \).

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
x = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
