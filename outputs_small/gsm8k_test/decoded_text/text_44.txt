Q: Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Okay, so Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles, and I need to figure out his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles. Hmm, so the number of candles depends on the amount of beeswax he has. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how much beeswax Charlie has. Hmm, maybe I need to figure that out or see if it's given somewhere else. Wait, the problem says "for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles." So, if he has 'x' pounds of beeswax, he can make 10x candles. But since the problem doesn't specify the amount, maybe I need to assume he uses all the beeswax he has, or perhaps it's given in the problem? Wait, let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says: "For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. If he sells each candle for $2.0 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?"

Wait, so maybe the cost is $10 per pound of beeswax and wicks? So, if he uses 1 pound of beeswax and wicks, it costs $10.00. So, each pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. So, if he makes 10 candles from 1 pound, then each candle would cost him 10 cents? Wait, no, because 1 pound gives 10 candles, so each candle would cost 1/10 of a pound, which would be $1.00 /10 = $1.00 per candle? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me parse the problem again.

He can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax. So, if he has 1 pound, he can make 10 candles. The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.000. So, the cost per candle is $10.00 divided by 10 candles, which is $1.00 per candle. So, each candle costs him $1.000 to make.

But wait, if he sells each candle for $2.000, then his profit per candle is $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 per candle. So, if he makes and sells 20 candles, his total revenue would be 20 * $2.00 = $40.00. His total cost would be 20 * $1.00 = $20.00. So, his net profit would be $40.000 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies." So, that's the cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks. So, if he makes 10 candles from 1 pound, then the cost per candle is $10.00 /10 = $1.00 per candle. So, each candle costs him $1.00 to make, and he sells each for $2.00, so profit per candle is $1.00. So, 20 candles would give him 20 * $1.00 = $20.00 profit.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if he uses 1 pound of beeswax and wicks, he can make 10 candles, so the cost is $10.00 for 10 candles, so each candle is $1.00. So, yes, each candle is $1.00 in cost, so selling at $2.00 each, profit is $1.00 per candle. So, 20 candles would be 20 * $1.00 = $22.00 profit.

Wait, but the problem says "he makes and sells 20 candles." So, is he making 20 candles, or is he making 10 candles from 1 pound? Wait, the problem says "for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles." So, 1 pound gives 10 candles. So, if he makes 20 candles, how much does he need?

Wait, 1 pound gives 1
