Q: A man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. How many sandwiches does this family eat in one week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the daily consumption of each family member.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Next, I'll calculate the total daily consumption by adding the daily amounts of all family members.

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Finally, to find the weekly consumption, I'll multiply the daily total by 7 days.

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches per week.

To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of each family member:**
   - **Man:** 5 sandwiches/day
   - **Wife:** 4 sandwiches/day
   - **Son:** 2 sandwiches/day

2. **Add the daily consumption of all family members:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches/day}
   \]

3. **Multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days):**
   \[
   11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{77}
\]
