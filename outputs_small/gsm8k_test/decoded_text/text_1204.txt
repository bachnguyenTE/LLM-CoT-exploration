Q: Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?

Okay, so I have this problem here where twenty tourists found 700 shells in a mall parking lot. They divided into three groups: Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters. The Alphas found 40% of the shells, and the The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. I need to figure out how many shells the Gogetters found. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 20 tourists in total, and they split into three groups. The first group is Alphas, who found 40% of the shells. Then, the The finders group found 60% of the remaining shells after the Alphas had taken their share. The rest went to the Gogetters, and I need to find out how many shells that was.

So, the total number of shells is 700. Let me write that down:

Total shells = 700

First, the Alphas found 40% of these shells. So, I need to calculate 40% of 700. To do that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.

40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form. So, 0.40 multiplied by 700.

Let me compute that:

0.40 * 700

Hmm, 0.4 times 700 is 280, right? Because 0.4 is 2/5, and 700 divided by 5 is 140, so 2/5 is 140. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.4 * 700.

Wait, 0.4 * 700. Let me compute 700 * 0.4.

Well, 700 * 0.4 is the same as 700 * 4 / 10, which is 2800 / 10, which is 280. So, 280 shells found by the Alphas.

So, Alphas found 280 shells.

Now, the remaining shells after the Alphas have taken their share would be 700 - 280.

Let me compute that: 700 - 280 = 420.

So, 420 shells are left after the Alphas.

Then, the The finders group found 60% of these remaining shells. So, 60% of 420.

Again, converting 60% to decimal is 0.60.

So, 0.60 * 420.

Let me compute that. 420 * 0.60 is the same as 420 * 6 / 10, which is 2520 / 10, which is 252.

So, The finders found 252 shells.

Now, the shells found by Gogetters would be the remaining shells after Alphas and The finders have taken theirs.

So, total shells: 700

Subtract shells found by Alphas: 700 - 280 = 420

Subtract shells found by The finders: 420 - 252 = 168

So, Gogetters found 168 shells.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Alphas: 40% of 700 is 280. That seems right because 10% is 70, so 40% is 4*70=280. Wait, hold on, 10% is 70, so 40% is 4*70=280. Wait, 70*4 is 280? Wait, 70*4 is 280, right? Because 70*2 is 140, so 70*4 is 280. So, yes, 280.

Then, 700 - 280 is 420. Correct.

Then, The finders found 60% of 420. 60% is 0.60. 420 * 0.60.

Let me compute 420 * 0.60 is 252, and 420 * 0.06 is 252. So, 252 + 252 is 504? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait
