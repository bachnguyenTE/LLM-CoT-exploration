Q: Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Grayson is recycling cans and bottles and earning money for that. Each week, she gets some money from recycling, and I need to figure out how much she earns in a four-week month. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out how much she earns each week. The problem says that an aluminum can is worth two cents, and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. So, each week, she recycles both cans and bottles. 

She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water each week. So, I need to calculate the earnings from the cans and the earnings from the bottles separately and then add them together for the total weekly earnings.

Let me write that down:

- Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents per can
- Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents per bottle

Then, add those two amounts together to get the total cents earned each week. After that, since the question is about a four-week month, I'll multiply the weekly earnings by four.

Alright, let's compute each part.

Starting with the cans: 3 cans * 2 cents. So, 3 times 2 is 6. So, she earns 6 cents from the aluminum cans each week.

Now, the plastic bottles: 5 bottles * 3 cents. 5 times 3 is 15. So, she earns 15 cents from the plastic bottles each week.

Adding those together: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents. So, Grayson earns 21 cents each week from recycling.

Now, to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, I need to multiply the weekly earnings by 4.

So, 21 cents * 4 weeks. Let me compute that. 21 * 4 is 84. So, 21 * 4 = 84.

Wait, hold on, 21 * 4 is 84? Let me double-check that. 20 * 4 is 80, and 1 * 4 is 4, so 80 + 4 is 84. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up.

So, recapping:

- 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
- 5 bottles *3 cents = 15 cents
- Total per week: 6 + 15 = 21 cents
- Total for four weeks: 21 * 4 = 84 cents

Yes, that seems right. So, 84 cents is the total she earns in a four-week month.

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. Each step seems straightforward, and I double-checked the multiplication. So, I'm confident that the answer is 84 cents.

**Final Answer**
Grayson earns \boxed{84} cents from the four-week month.

Grayson recycles cans and bottles and earns money for that. Each week, she recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles. 

- Earnings from aluminum cans per week: \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents}\)
- Earnings from plastic bottles per week: \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\)
- Total weekly earnings: \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\)

For a four-week month, the total earnings are:
- Total earnings for four weeks: \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\)

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from the four-week month.
