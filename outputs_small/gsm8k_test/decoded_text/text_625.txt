Q: Arianna plants a garden that has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. How many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. Right now, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. I need to figure out how many flowers have actually bloomed. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me find out the total number of flowers in the garden. There are 10 rows, each with 20 flowers. So, I think I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row. That would be 10 multiplied by 20. Let me write that out:

Total flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
Total flowers = 10 × 20

Hmm, 10 times 20. Well, 10 times 20 is 220. So, there are 220 flowers in total in the garden. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem says that only 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. So, I need to find 4/5 of 220. To How do I do that? I think I need to multiply 220 by 4/5. Let me write that down:

Bloomed flowers = Total flowers × (4/5)
Bloomed flowers = 220 × (4/5)

Hmm, okay, so 220 multiplied by 4/5. Let me think about how to compute that. Maybe I can simplify the multiplication by dividing 220 by 5 first and then multiplying by 4. That might be easier.

So, 220 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 goes into 220 how many times? 5 times 40 is 200, so that's 44. So, 220 divided by 5 is 44. Then, I multiply that by 4. 44 times 4 is 176. So, 220 multiplied by 4/5 is 176.

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I can do it another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 4/5 is the same as 0.8 in decimal form. So, if I take 220 and multiply it by 0.8, that should give me the same result.

220 times 0.8. Let me compute that. 220 times 0.8 is the same as 2/5 of 220, right? Because 0.8 is 4/5, which is 0.8. Alternatively, 220 times 0.8 is 220 times 8 divided by 10. So, 220 times 8 is 1760, and then divided by 10 is 176. So, that's the same answer as before. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of 220 divided by 5 is 44, and 44 times 4 is 176. So, both methods give me 176. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed is 176.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, 10 rows, each with 20 flowers. 10 times 20 is 220. That's straightforward. Then, 4/5 of 220. So, 220 divided by 5 is 44, and 44 times 4 is 176. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, if I think about 4/5 as 0.8, 220 times 0.8. Let me compute 220 times 0.8. 220 times 0.8 is 176. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 220 as 200 + 2. So, 220 is 220 + 2. So, 220 times 0.8 is (220 × 0.8) = (220 × 0.8). Hmm, 220 times 0.8 is 176. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 220 divided by 5 is 44, and 44 times 4 is 176. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 220 divided by 5 is 44, and 44 times 4 is 1
