Q: Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, I subtract 23 from 100 to find that Beck has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this exchange, Boris will have 100 minus 10, which equals 90 apples. Meanwhile, Beck will have 77 plus 10, which is 77 apples.

Finally, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange, I subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number Boris has: 90 minus 77 equals 13. Therefore, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of apples Beck has.**

\[
\text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

**Step 2: Boris gives Beck 10 apples.**

- **Boris's new apple count:**
  
  \[
  100 - 10 = 90
  \]
  
- **Beck's new apple count:**
  
  \[
  77 + 10 = 87
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.**

\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 13
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{13}
\]
