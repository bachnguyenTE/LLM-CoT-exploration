Q: Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client’s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?

Okay, so Kim is starting his own housekeeping business and wants to figure out his weekly profit. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to understand all the components involved in calculating his profit.

He already has 3 clients, but he's talking to 5 more potential clients. So, in total, he's planning to work with 3 + 5 = 8 clients. That makes sense because he's already got some clients but is expanding his business.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. Hmm, so for each client, he needs 2 bottles and 1 pack. Let me write that down:

- Bottles of bleach per client: 2
- Packs of cloths per client: 1

Now, the costs are given: each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each pack of cloths costs $5. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the materials for all 8 clients.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bottles of bleach. Each client needs 2 bottles, and each bottle is $2. So, per client, the cost for bleach is 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4. Since he has 8 clients, the total cost for bleach would be 8 clients * $4/client = $32.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the packs of cloths. Each client needs 1 pack, and each pack is $5. So, per client, the cost for cloths is 1 pack * $5/pack = $5. For 8 clients, the total cost for cloths is 8 clients * $5/client = $40.

So, adding both costs together, the total expenses for materials would be $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72. Wait, that adds up to $72? Let me double-check that. 8 * 4 is 32, and 8 *5 is 40. 32 + 40 is indeed 72. So, total expenses are $72.

Now, his total income each week is $92. Profit is calculated as total income minus total expenses. So, profit = $92 - $72 = $2.

Wait, that seems low. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Maybe I miscounted the number of clients or the costs.

He has 3 clients already, and is talking to 5 more, so 3 + 5 = 8. That seems correct. Each client needs 2 bottles and 1 pack. So, 8 * 2 = 16 bottles and 8 *1 = 8 packs.

Calculating the cost again: 16 bottles at $2 each is 16 * 2 = $32. 8 packs at $5 each is 8 *5 = $40. So, total cost is $32 + $40 = $72. Wait, hold on, that's different from before. Earlier, I thought it was $72, but in my first calculation, I thought it was $72, but then I wrote $72 again. Wait, no, in the first calculation, I thought 8 *4 was 32, and 8*5 was 40, which adds to 72. So, that's correct.

Wait, so earlier, I thought the total expenses were $72, but then I wrote $72 again. So, total expenses are $72. Then, his total income is $92. So, profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me go through it again.

Total clients: 3 +5 =8.

Total bottles needed: 8 *2 =16 bottles.

Total packs needed:8 *1=8 packs.

Cost for bottles:16 * $2 = $12.

Cost for packs:8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses: $12 + $40 = $52.

Wait, now I'm confused. So, which is correct? Earlier, I thought 8 *4 was 32, but that was for 8 bottles. Wait, no, 8 bottles at $2 each is 16, not 32. So, 8 bottles would be 8*2=16, not 32. So, I think I made a mistake in the first calculation.

So, let me recast the entire calculation.

Total clients: 8.

Each client needs 2 bottles and 1 pack.

Total bottles needed:8 *2=16.

Total packs needed:8 *1=8.

Cost per bottle: $2.
