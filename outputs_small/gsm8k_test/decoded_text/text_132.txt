Q: Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?

Okay, so Pam and Fred went to a carnival, and I need to figure out how many tickets they used that day. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Then, both of them decided to ride the luge 2 times each. Each ride costs 6 tickets. I need to calculate the total number of tickets they used.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out how many times each of them rode the roller coaster. Pam rode it 2 times, so that's straightforward. Fred rode it 4 times. So, together, they rode the roller coaster 2 + 4 = 6 times. Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets, so I can multiply the number of rides by the tickets per ride to find out how many tickets they used for the roller coaster.

So, for the roller coaster, that would be 6 rides * 6 tickets per ride. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36. So, they used 36 tickets just for the roller coaster.

Now, moving on to the luge. The problem says each of them rode the luge 2 times. So, Pam rode it 2 times, and Fred also rode it 2 times. That means together, they rode the luge 2 + 2 = 4 times. Each luge ride also costs 6 tickets, so I need to multiply the number of luge rides by the tickets per ride.

That would be 4 rides * 6 tickets per ride. Let me do that multiplication: 4 * 6 is 24. So, they used 24 tickets for the luge.

Now, to find the total number of tickets they used that day, I need to add the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge together. So, 36 tickets for the roller coaster plus 24 tickets for the luge.

Adding those together: 36 + 24. Let me add the units place first: 6 + 4 is 10. Wait, that can't be right. 36 + 24. Let me write it down vertically to make sure I don't make a mistake.

```
 36
+24
----
```

Starting from the right, 6 + 4 is 10. So, I write down 0 and carry over 1. Then, 3 + 2 is 5, plus the carried over 1 is 6. So, the total is 60. So, 36 + 24 is 60.

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, Fred 4 times. That's 6 rides. 6 rides * 6 tickets = 36 tickets. Then, luge: each rode 2 times, so 4 rides. 4 *6=24. 36 +24=60. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as each person's rides and then sum them up. But since both Pam and Fred rode the roller coaster and luge, it's better to calculate the total rides first and then multiply by the tickets per ride.

Wait, another way: total roller coaster rides: 2 +4=6. Total luge rides:2 +2=4. Total rides:6 +4=10. Each ride is 6 tickets, so 10 *6=60. Yep, same result.

So, I think 60 is the correct total number of tickets used that day.

**Final Answer**
The total number of tickets used that day is \boxed{60}.

Pam and Fred went to a carnival and rode the roller coaster and luge multiple times. Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets, and each luge ride also costs 6 tickets.

First, we calculate the number of rides for the roller coaster:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides: \(2 + 4 = 6\).

Next, we calculate the number of rides for the luge:
- Pam rode the luge 2 times.
- Fred rode the luge 2 times.
- Total luge rides: \(2 + 2 = 4\).

Now, we calculate the total number of tickets used for each type of ride:
- Tickets for roller coaster: \(6 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 36 \text{ tickets}\).
- Tickets for luge: \(4 \text{ rides} \times 6
