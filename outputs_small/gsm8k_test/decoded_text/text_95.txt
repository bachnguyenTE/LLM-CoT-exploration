Q: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Grade 5 students, and I need to figure out how many girls are not in the girl scout. Let me read it again: There are 200 Grade 5 students in total, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. I need to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the total number of students is 200. Wait, is that 200 or 200? Maybe a typo, but I think it's 200. So, 220 students in total. Let me confirm that. Yeah, 220 is the total number of Grade 5 students. So, 220 students in total.

Now, 2/5 of these are boys. So, I need to find out how many boys there are. To do that, I can calculate 2/5 of 220. Let me write that down: Number of boys = (2/5) * 220. Let me compute that. 220 divided by 5 is 44, and 44 times 2 is 88. So, there are 88 boys in Grade 5.

Since the total number of students is 220, the number of girls would be the total minus the number of boys. So, number of girls = 220 - 88. Let me subtract that: 220 - 88 is 132, and then subtract another 8, which gives 124. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 220 minus 88. Let me do it properly. 220 minus 80 is 132, but wait, 88 is 80 + 8, so 220 - 80 is 140, and then minus 8 is 132. So, 132 girls. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my math again.

Wait, 220 divided by 5 is 44, so 2/5 is 88. So, 2/5 is 44, so 2/5 is 88. So, 220 - 88 is 132. Yeah, that's correct. So, 132 girls. Okay, so 132 girls in total.

Now, the problem says that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, I need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout. That would be (2/3) * number of girls. So, number of girls in girl scout = (2/3) * 132. Let me compute that.

First, 132 divided by 3 is 44, because 3 times 44 is 132. So, 132 divided by 3 is 44. Then, 44 times 2 is 88. So, 88 girls are in the girl scout.

But the question is asking for how many girls are not in the girl scout. So, I need to subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. So, number of girls not in girl scout = total girls - girls in girl scout = 132 - 88.

Let me compute that: 132 minus 88. 132 - 88. 132 minus 80 is 52, and then minus 8 more is 44. So, 44 girls are not in the girl scout.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total students: 220. 2/5 are boys: 220 divided by 5 is 44, times 2 is 88. So, 88 boys. 220 minus 88 is 132 girls. 2/3 of 132 is 88. 132 minus 88 is 44. So, 44 girls are not in the girl scout.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using fractions step by step.

Alternatively, I can think of the total number of students as 220. 2/5 are boys, so 3/5 are girls. Wait, is that right? Because 2/5 are boys, so the rest are girls. So, 1 - 2/5 is
