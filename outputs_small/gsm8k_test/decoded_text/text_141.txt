Q: There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about bees in a hive. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says there are 700 bees in total. It also mentions the relationships between the different types of bees: worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Specifically, it says there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. I need to find out how many worker bees there are.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably assign variables to each type of bee to make it easier to work with. Let me think... If I let the number of queens be a variable, say Q, then maybe I can express the number of baby bees and worker bees in terms of Q. That seems like a good approach.

So, let's say the number of queens is Q. Then, the problem says there are twice as many baby bees as queens. So, the number of baby bees would be 2 times Q, right? So, baby bees = 2Q.

Similarly, it says there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if the number of baby bees is 2Q, then the number of worker bees would be twice that, which is 2*(2Q) = 4Q. So, worker bees = 4Q.

Now, the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. So, that would be Q (queens) + 2Q (baby bees) + 4Q (worker bees) = total bees.

Let me write that out: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So, queens are Q, baby bees are 2Q, worker bees are 4Q. Adding them together gives the total number of bees, which is 700. So, Q + 2Q + 4Q equals 700.

Let me compute that. Q + 2Q is 3Q, and 3Q + 4Q is 7Q. So, 7Q = 700.

To find Q, I can divide both sides by 7. So, Q = 700 / 7. Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 7 is 100. So, Q = 100.

So, the number of queens is 100. Now, since the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, that would be 2*100 = 200 baby bees. And the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so that's 2*200 = 400 worker bees.

Wait, let me double-check that. If queens are 100, baby bees are 200, and worker bees are 400, then adding them up: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Yep, that adds up correctly.

So, the number of worker bees is 400. That seems straightforward, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in interpreting the relationships.

The problem says twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if there are 200 baby bees, then worker bees should be 400, which is indeed twice 200. Similarly, twice as many baby bees as queens: 200 is twice 100. So, all the relationships check out.

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 400 worker bees.

**Final Answer**
The number of worker bees is \boxed{400}.

Let \( Q \) be the number of queens. According to the problem, the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees is given as 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
7Q = 700
\]
Solving for \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[
Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is
