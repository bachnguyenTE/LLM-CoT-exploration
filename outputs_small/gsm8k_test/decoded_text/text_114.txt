Q: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jamal and Brittany's phone photos. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Hmm, okay, so if I let the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold be some number, say B, then Jamal's phone can hold 6 times that, right? So that would be 6B. But wait, the problem also says that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

It says, "The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo." So, that means B, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, is equal to 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. So, if I let the number of birds be, say, D, then B = 50D. Wait, 50 sounds like 50, but in math problems, sometimes 50 is used as a coefficient, but here it's written as 50. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's 50 times? Hmm, maybe it's 50 times? Wait, no, 50 is 50. Wait, no, 50 is fifty, 50 is fifty. Wait, maybe it's 50 times? Hmm, the problem says "50 times more." So, 50 times more than the number of birds. So, that would be 50 multiplied by the number of birds. So, B = 50 * D. So, if I let D be the number of birds, then B is 50 times D.

But wait, the problem also says that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if B is the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, then Jamal's phone can hold 6 times that, so 6B. But we are told that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, 6B = 1800. So, B is 1800 divided by 6, which is 300. So, B is 300.

But wait, B is also equal to 50 times D, so 300 = 50 * D. Wait, hold on, 50 times D? So, 300 = 50 * D. So, D is 300 divided by 50. Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 50 is 6, so 300 divided by 50 is 6. So, D is 6. So, the number of birds is 6.

Wait, but the question is asking how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. So, is D the number of ducks? So, the answer is 6. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

So, let's go through it again. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if B is Brittany's capacity, then Jamal's is 6B. But it's also given that B is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. So, B = 50 * D, where D is the number of birds. So, substituting, 6B = 1800, so B is 300. Then, 300 = 50 * D, so D is 6. So, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, 50 times more is a bit confusing. Is it 50 times the number of birds, or 50 more than the number of birds? Because sometimes "times more" can be ambiguous. So, if it's 50 times more, that could mean 50 times the number, or 50 more than the number. But in this case, the problem says "50 times more than the number of birds." So, that would mean 50 multiplied by the number of birds. So, B = 50 * D. So, that's how I interpreted it.

But just to make sure, let's think about it. If it was 50 more, then B would be 50 + D, but that would be 50 + D, which doesn't make much sense because D is a number of birds, so it's a count. So, 50 times more is more appropriate.

So,
