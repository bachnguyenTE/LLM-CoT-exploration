Q: There is space for 20 pencils in the box. If there are 4 pencils missing from the box, how many pairs of pencils are in the box?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of pencils that were originally in the box. The problem states that there is space for 200 pencils and currently there are 4 pencils missing.

To find the total number of pencils, I'll add the number of missing pencils to the number of pencils that are currently in the box. So, 200 (total space) minus 4 (missing pencils) equals 216 pencils in the box.

Next, I need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. A pair consists of 2 pencils, so I'll divide the total number of pencils by 2.

Dividing 216 by 2 gives me 108 pairs of pencils.

**Solution:**

We are given:
- Total space available in the box: 200 pencils
- Number of pencils missing from the box: 4

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of pencils currently in the box.

\[
\text{Total pencils} = \text{Total space} - \text{Missing pencils} = 200 - 4 = 216
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of pairs of pencils.

\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{2} = \frac{216}{2} = 108
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{108}
\]
