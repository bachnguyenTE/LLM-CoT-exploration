Okay, so I have this problem here about Ava, Cole, and Xavier's heights after the summer. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. The question is asking for the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now.

Alright, so I need to find out how tall Cole and Xavier are now and then subtract their heights to find the difference. Let me break this down.

Starting with Xavier. He was 4 feet tall before the summer. Hmm, I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet would be 4 times 12 inches. Let me calculate that. 4 times 12 is 48 inches. So Xavier was 48 inches tall before the summer. Then he grew 3 inches over the summer. So his new height is 48 inches plus 3 inches. That should be 51 inches. Let me write that down: Xavier's current height is 51 inches.

Now, moving on Cole. He was 50 inches tall before the summer. He grew 2 inches over the summer. So his current height is 50 inches plus 2 inches. That should be 52 inches. So Cole is now 52 inches tall.

Now, I need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights. So that would be 52 inches minus 51 inches. Let me subtract that: 52 minus 51 is 51 inches. So the difference is 51 inches.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Xavier was 4 feet, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so 48 + 3 is indeed 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches, grew 2 inches, so 50 + 2 is 52 inches. Then, 52 minus 51 is 51 inches. That seems right.

But just to make sure, let me convert Xavier's original height from feet to inches again. 4 feet is 48 inches, correct. 48 + 3 is 51 inches. And Cole was 50 inches, so 50 + 2 is 52 inches. 52 minus 51 is 51 inches. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. If I subtract 51 from 52, I get 1 inch, not 51 inches. Wait, no, that's not right. 52 minus 51 is 1 inch. Wait, that can't be. Because 52 inches is taller than 51 inches by 1 inch. So the difference is 1 inch. Hmm, that seems small, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I messed up the subtraction. 52 minus 51 is 1. So the difference is 1 inch. So the answer is 1 inch. But let me make sure.

Wait, 52 inches minus 51 inches is 1 inch. So yes, the difference is 1 inch. So the answer is 1 inch.

But hold on, let me think about the units. Both heights are in inches, so the difference is in inches. So 1 inch is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial conversion. So Xavier was 4 feet tall. 4 feet is 48 inches, correct. 48 inches plus 3 inches is 51 inches. So that's correct. Cole was 50 inches, plus 2 inches is 52 inches. So 52 minus 51 is 1 inch. So the difference is 1 inch.

Wait, but 1 inch is a very small difference. Is that realistic? Maybe, but I think the problem is just asking for the difference, so 1 inch is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert Xavier's original height to inches and then do the subtraction. So 4 feet is 48 inches, plus 3 inches is 51 inches. Cole is 50 inches, so 50 inches. 52 minus 51 is 1 inch. So yeah, 1 inch is the difference.

Wait, but hold on, 50 inches is 5 feet 5 inches? Wait, no, 50 inches is 4 feet 2 inches because 12 inches is a foot. So 50 inches is 4 feet 2 inches. So 4 feet 2
