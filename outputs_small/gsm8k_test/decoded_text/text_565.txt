Q: Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. The problem says he ate a third of the sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches in total, I can calculate a third of 12. To do that, I can divide 12 by 3. Wait, no, 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches. Let me write that down: 12 ÷ 3 = 4. That makes sense because a third of 12 is 4.

Next, I need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. The problem states he ate a quarter of the sandwiches. So, I should calculate a quarter of 12. A quarter is the same as dividing by 4, right? So, 12 ÷ 4 is 3. Therefore, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches. I can write that as: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

Now, I have to find out how many sandwiches are left after both of them ate their shares. So, I need to subtract the sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor from the total number of sandwiches. That means I'll subtract 4 (Cody's share) and 3 (Trevor's share) from 12.

Let me do the subtraction: 12 - 4 - 3. Hmm, 12 minus 4 is 8, and then 8 minus 3 is 5. So, that would mean there are 5 sandwiches left. Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 12 sandwiches. Cody ate 1/3, which is 4, so 12 - 4 = 8. Then Trevor ate 1/4 of the original 12, which is 3, so 8 - 3 = 5. Yeah, that seems right. So, 5 sandwiches are left.

Alternatively, I can think of it another way. Maybe find the total number of sandwiches they ate together and subtract that from the original total. So, if Cody ate 4 and Trevor ate 3, together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. Then, 12 - 7 = 5. That also gives me 5 sandwiches left. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using fractions? Let me try that. The total number of sandwiches is 12. Cody ate 1/3, so that's 12*(1/3) = 4. Trevor ate 1/4, so that's 12*(1/4) = 3. So, together, they ate 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, 12 - 7 = 5. Yep, same result.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can represent this with equations. Let me denote the total number of sandwiches as T, which is 12. Then, the number of sandwiches Cody ate is (1/3)*T, and Trevor ate (1/4)*T. So, the total eaten is (1/3 + 1/4)*T. Let me compute that.

First, I need to add 1/3 and 1/4. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 4 is 12. So, converting both fractions: 1/3 is 4/12 and 1/4 is 3/12. Adding them together: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. So, together, they ate 7/12 of the total sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is T - (7/12)*T. Since T is 12, that's 12 - (7/12)*12. Simplifying, (7/12)*12 is 7, so 12 - 7 = 5. Again, same answer. So, this method also confirms that 5 sandwiches are left.

I think I've covered multiple ways to approach this problem, and each time, I arrive at the same conclusion: 5 sandwiches are left. It seems pretty straightforward once I break it down step by step. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 5 is the correct answer.

Just to recap:

1. Total sandwiches: 12
2. Cody ate: 1
