Q: Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Wendy wants to add 20 more than double the number of books to her shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many books are currently in the system. Since it's a 6x6 grid, that means there are 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of books, I should multiply the number of rows by the number of columns. So, 6 multiplied by 6. Let me write that down:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. 6 times 6 is 36? No, that's not correct. 6 times 6 is actually 36? No, that's 36. I must have messed up the multiplication. Let me recalculate: 6*6 is 36. Yeah, that's right. So, the system currently holds 36 books. Hmm, that seems low, but maybe it's a small shelf.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. So, first, I need to find double the current number of books. If there are 36 books, double that would be 36*2. Let me compute that: 36*2 is 72. So, double the number of books is 72.

But Wendy wants to add 20 more than that. So, I need to add 20 to 72. That would be 72 + 20. Wait, 72 + 20 is 92. So, she needs to add 92 books to the system.

But hold on, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says, "Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books." So, is it double the current number plus 20, or double the total number of books plus 20? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the way it's phrased is "20 more than double the number of books." So, it's double the number of books, which is 72, and then add 20. So, 72 + 20 is 92. So, 92 books.

But let me think again. If it were double the total number of books, which would be 2*36=72, and then add 20, that would be 72 + 20=92. So, same result. So, regardless of how you parse it, it seems like it's 92 books.

Wait, but 72 + 20 is 92, and 72 + 20 is 92. So, same answer either way. So, Wendy needs to add 92 books to the system.

But hold on, let me make sure. The system has 36 books. She wants to add 20 more than double that. So, double is 72, plus 20 is 92. So, 92 books. So, total books will be 36 + 92=128.

Wait, but the question is asking how many books will she need to carry to complete her task. So, does that mean she needs to add 92 books, or does it mean she needs to carry 92 books? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says, "How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?" So, maybe she needs to carry 92 books to add to the system. But that seems a bit odd because she's adding books, not carrying them. Maybe it's a translation issue or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's asking how many books she needs to add, which would be 92. But the question says "how many books will she need to carry to complete her task." So, perhaps she needs to carry 92 books to add to the system.

But let me think again. If the system has 36 books, and she wants to add 20 more than double that. So, double is 72, plus 20 is 92. So, she needs to add 92 books. So, the number of books she needs to carry is 92.

Alternatively, if she's moving books into the system, she might need to carry 92 books. So, maybe the answer is 92.

But let me double-check my calculations. 6 rows, 6 columns: 6*6=36. Double that is 72. 20 more than that is 92. So, yes, 92 books
