Q: Tim grows 5 trees.  Each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree.  How many lemons does he get in a decade?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of trees Tim has. He grows 5 trees.

Next, I'll calculate the number of lemons each tree produces annually. Each tree yields 6 lemons per year.

Then, I'll find the total number of lemons produced by all trees in one year by multiplying the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree: 5 trees × 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year.

After that, I'll calculate the total number of lemons produced over a decade by multiplying the annual production by 10: 30 lemons/year ×10 years = 360 lemons.

Finally, I'll present the final answer clearly.

**Solution:**

1. **Number of Trees:**
   - Tim grows **5 trees**.

2. **Lemons per Tree per Year:**
   - Each tree yields **6 lemons** per year.

3. **Total Lemons per Year:**
   - Total lemons = Number of trees × Lemons per tree
   - Total lemons = 5 trees × 6 lemons/tree = **30 lemons/year**

4. **Total Lemons in a Decade:**
   - A decade has **10 years**.
   - Total lemons in 10 years = Total lemons/year × 10
   - Total lemons in 10 years = 30 lemons/year × 10 = **360 lemons**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
