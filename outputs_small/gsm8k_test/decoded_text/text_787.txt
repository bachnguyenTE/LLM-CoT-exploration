Q: Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Samwell's appliances store, and I need to figure out how many OLED TVs they sold this week. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

It says that for this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. They sold a total of 40 TVs. Hmm, wait, 40 TVs? That seems a bit high because 40 is a lot, but maybe it's a typo. I think it's probably supposed to be 40 TVs, but let me double-check. No, wait, 40 is also a number, but in the context of sales, 40 seems too high. Maybe it's 40 TVs? Or maybe it's 40 units? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says "a total of 40 TVs," so I think that's correct. So, 40 TVs in total. So, 40 TVs sold, and we need to find out how many were OLED TVs.

Alright, so let's break this down. The sales are divided into three categories: smart TVs, analog TVs, and OLED TVs. The fractions given are one-fourth for smart TVs and one-eighth for analog TVs. The rest are OLED TVs.

So, first, I need to find out how many TVs are smart TVs and how many are analog TVs, and then subtract the sum of those from the total to get the number of OLED TVs.

Let me write this down step by step.

Total TVs sold = 40

Smart TVs = (1/4) * Total TVs

Analog TVs = (1/8) * Total TVs

OLED TVs = Total TVs - Smart TVs - Analog TVs

So, let me compute each part.

First, compute the number of smart TVs:

Smart TVs = (1/4) * 40

Hmm, 1/4 of 40 is 10, right? Because 40 divided by 4 is 10. So, 10 smart TVs.

Next, compute the number of analog TVs:

Analog TVs = (1/8) * 40

Hmm, 1/8 of 40. Let me think. 40 divided by 8 is 5. So, 5 analog TVs.

So, now, let's add the smart and analog TVs together:

Smart TVs + Analog TVs = 10 + 5 = 15

So, 15 TVs are either smart or analog.

Therefore, the remaining TVs must be OLED TVs.

So, OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Smart + Analog TVs) = 40 - 15 = 25

Wait, so 25 OLED TVs?

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Smart TVs: 1/4 of 40 is 10. That seems right.

Analog TVs: 1/8 of 40 is 5. That also seems correct.

Adding them together: 10 + 5 = 15. So, 15 TVs accounted for.

Subtracting from total: 40 - 15 = 25. So, 25 OLED TVs.

Wait, but 25 seems a lot. Let me think again. If 1/4 is smart, that's 10, 1/8 is analog, that's 5, so 15. So, 40 -15 is 25. Yeah, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me think about the fractions. 1/4 is 0.25, 1/8 is 0.125. So, 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375. So, 0.375 of the total is accounted for by smart and analog TVs. So, 0.375 * 40 = 15 TVs, which matches what I had before.

So, 40 -15 =25. So, 25 is the number of OLED TVs.

Wait, but 25 is a lot. Let me think about the fractions again. 1/4 is 10, 1/8 is 5, so 15. So, 15 is 1/8 of 40, which is 5. So, 15 is 1/8 of 40, which is 5. So, 15 is 1/8 of 40, which is 5. So, 15 is 1/8 of 40, which is 5. So, 15 is 1/
