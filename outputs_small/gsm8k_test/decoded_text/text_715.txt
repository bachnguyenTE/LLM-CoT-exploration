Q: A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the original price per computer, which is $700.

Next, I'll calculate the new price after a 10% increase. To do this, I'll find 10% of $770, which is $77. Adding this to the original price gives the new price per computer as $847.

Finally, I'll multiply the new price per computer by the total number of computers, 500, to find the total amount paid. This results in $423,500.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the original price per computer:**
   
   \[
   \text{Original Price} = \$700
   \]

2. **Calculate the new price after a 10% increase:**
   
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$700 = 0.10 \times 700 = \$77
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$700 + \$77 = \$777
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 500 \times \$777 = \$423,\!500
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$423,\!550}
\]
