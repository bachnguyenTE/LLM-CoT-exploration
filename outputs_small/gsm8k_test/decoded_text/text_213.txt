Q: While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers by the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Sloane counting customers at a dollar store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers. That's straightforward. Then, on the next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. Hmm, so that would be 100 plus 50, right? Let me write that down to keep track.

First day: 100 customers.

Second day: 100 + 50 = 155 customers.

Okay, so by the end of the second day, how many customers have there been in total? Well, that would be the sum of the first and second day. So, 100 + 155. Let me add those together. 100 plus 100 is 200, and then plus 55 is 275. So, by the end of the second day, there have been 275 customers.

Now, the problem says that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. So, that means by the end of the third day, the total is 500. I need to find out how many customers were counted on the third day. 

Let me think. If by the end of the second day, there were 275 customers, and by the end of the third day, it's 500, then the number of customers on the third day must be the difference between these two totals. So, I can subtract the total by the end of the second day from the total by the end of the third day.

So, that would be 500 minus 275. Let me do that subtraction. 500 minus 200 is 300, and then minus 75 is 225. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Alternatively, I can break it down differently. 500 minus 275. Hmm, 500 minus 200 is 300, and then minus 75 is 225. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the number of customers on the third day is 225.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first day: 100, second day: 155, total after two days: 255. Third day: 225. So, 255 plus 225 is 480. Wait, that doesn't add up to 500. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back. It says, "the total number of customers by the third day was 500." So, that means the total after three days is 500. So, if I have the first day as 100, second day as 155, then the third day must be 500 minus (100 + 155). Let me compute that.

100 + 155 is 255. So, 500 minus 255 is 245. Wait, so is it 245? But earlier, I thought it was 225. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the second day. Let me read the problem again. It says, "the next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day." So, first day: 100, next day: 100 + 50 = 150. Wait, hold on, is that 50 or 50? The way it's written is 50 more, so 50. So, 100 + 50 is 155. So, that's correct.

So, first day: 100, second day: 155, total after two days: 255. Third day: 500 - 255 = 245. So, 245. So, why did I get 225 earlier? Maybe I added 100 + 155 incorrectly.

Wait, 100 + 155 is 255, right? 100 + 100 is 200, plus 55 is 255. So, 500 - 255 is 245. So, that's correct. So, the third day's count is 245.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the problem
