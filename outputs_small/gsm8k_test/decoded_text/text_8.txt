Q: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John driving and trying to get home. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what's happening. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something. Then he tries to get home, but he gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours, then drives for half an hour at 30 mph, and then the rest of the time at 80 mph. I need to find out how far he is from home after these 4 hours.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Maybe I should calculate the distance he traveled in each part of his trip and then see where he ends up.

First part: He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. So, distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? So, 60 mph * 3 hours. Let me calculate that. 60 times 3 is 180. So, he's 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Then he turns around, so he starts heading back. Now, he tries to get home in 4 hours, but he gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours. So, in those 2 hours, he's stuck in traffic, which is 0 mph. So, he doesn't move during that time. So, after 2 hours, he's still 180 miles away from home.

Then, he spends the next half-hour driving at 30 mph. So, half an hour is 0.5 hours. So, distance covered in that time is 30 mph * 0.5 hours. Let me compute that. 30 times 0.5 is 15. So, he adds another 15 miles towards home. So, his distance from home is now 180 - 15 = 165 miles.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? Because he was 180 miles away, then he drove back 15 miles, so he's 165 miles away from home. Hmm, okay.

Then, he spends the remaining time driving at 80 mph. The total time he has is 4 hours. He already spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving, so that's 2.5 hours. So, the remaining time is 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours. So, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph. Let me calculate that. 80 * 1.5 is 120. So, he adds another 120 miles towards home. So, his distance from home is now 165 - 120 = 45 miles.

Wait, so he started 180 miles away, then drove back 15 miles, then drove another 120 miles towards home. So, 180 -15 +120 = 285 miles from home? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, no, actually, when he turns around, he's 180 miles away. Then, he spends 2 hours in traffic, so he's still 180 miles away. Then, he drives 0.5 hours at 30 mph, so he covers 15 miles towards home, so now he's 180 -15 = 165 miles away. Then, he drives 1.5 hours at 80 mph, so 80 *1.5 is 120 miles. So, he's 165 -120 = 45 miles away from home. So, he ends up 45 miles away from home.

Wait, but that seems like he's getting closer to home. But let me double-check my calculations.

First part: 3 hours at 60 mph. 60*3=180. So, 180 miles away.

Then, he turns around, so he's 180 miles away from home.

Then, he spends 2 hours in traffic, so he's still 180 miles away.

Then, he drives 0.5 hours at 30 mph. 30*0.5=15. So, he's 180 -15=165 miles away.

Then, he drives 1.5 hours at 80 mph. 80*1.5=120. So, 165 -120=45 miles away.

So, yes, he ends up 45 miles away from home.

Wait, but is that correct? Because he started 180 miles away, then
