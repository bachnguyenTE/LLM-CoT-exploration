Q: Justin has a jar with many coins in it. The jar has 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. What is the total dollar amount in the jar?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Justin has a jar with a bunch of coins, and I need to figure out how much money is in the jar in total. The coins are quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Let me see, I remember that each type of coin has a different value, so I need to calculate the total value for each type and then add them all together. 

First, let me list out the number of each type of coin and their respective values. Quarters are worth 25 cents, dimes are 10 cents, nickels are 5 cents, and pennies are 1 cent. Since the question is asking for the total in dollars, I should convert each total amount from cents to dollars at the end, or maybe just work in cents and then convert at the end. Hmm, maybe working in cents is easier because I can just add them up and then divide by 100 to get dollars. Let me think about that.

So, the jar has 32 quarters. Each quarter is 25 cents, so I can calculate the total value of the quarters by multiplying 32 by 25. Let me write that down: 32 * 25. Hmm, 32 times 20 is 64, and 32 times 5 is 160, so adding those together, 64 + 160 is 124. So, the quarters are worth 124 cents. Okay, that seems right.

Next, the dimes. There are 95 dimes, each worth 10 cents. So, 95 * 10. Well, 95 times 10 is straightforward, it's 950 cents. So, the dimes add up to 950 cents. That seems a lot, but okay, 95 dimes is 950 cents.

Then, nickels. There are 120 nickels, each worth 5 cents. So, 120 * 5. Let me calculate that. 120 times 5 is 600. So, the nickels are worth 600 cents. That's a significant amount, but again, 120 nickels is 600 cents.

Lastly, the pennies. There are 750 pennies, each worth 1 cent. So, 750 * 1 is 750 cents. So, the pennies are worth 750 cents.

Now, I need to add up all these amounts in cents to get the total. Let me write them down:

- Quarters: 124 cents
- Dimes: 950 cents
- Nickels: 600 cents
- Pennies: 750 cents

So, adding them together: 124 + 950 + 600 + 750. Let me do this step by step.

First, 124 + 950. Let me add 124 and 950. 124 + 950. 124 + 900 is 1024, and then +50 is 1024 + 50 = 1074. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 124 + 950. Let me think again. 124 + 950. 124 + 900 is 1024, and then +50 is 1074. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, actually, 124 + 950. Let me do it another way. 124 + 950. 124 + 900 is 1024, and then +50 is 1079. Wait, now I'm confused. Maybe I should just add them digit by digit.

Let me write it down:

  124
+950
------
Starting from the right: 4 + 5 is 9. 2 + 5 is 7. 1 + 9 is 10. So, 1074. Okay, so 124 + 950 is 1074. That's correct.

Now, adding the next number, which is 600. So, 1074 + 600. Let's do that. 1074 + 600. 1074 + 600. 1074 + 600 is 1674, and then +60 is 1680. Wait, no,
