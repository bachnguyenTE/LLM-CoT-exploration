Q: Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How much more did Kelly pay than Becky?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Becky and Kelly both bought apples, but they got different discounts and prices. I need to figure out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at Becky's purchase. She bought 20 apples, each costing 45 cents. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for Becky before any discounts. That should be 20 apples multiplied by 45 cents each. Let me write that out:

20 apples * $0.45/apple

Hmm, 20 times 45 is... wait, 20 times 45. Let me compute that. 20 times 45 is 100, and 2 times 45 is 90, so adding those together, 100 + 90 is 200. So, 20 apples at 45 cents each would be $2.20. Wait, is that right? 20 times 45 is 220? Wait, no, 20 is 20, 20 times 45. Maybe I should do it another way. 45 times 20. 45 times 2 is 90, and 45 times 20 is 900? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should just do 45 * 20.

45 * 20 is 900, and 45 * 20 is 900, so 900 + 900 is 1800? Wait, that can't be right because 45 * 20 is 900. Wait, no, 45 * 20 is 900. So, 20 apples at 45 cents each is 900 cents, which is $9.00. Wait, that makes more sense. So, 20 apples at 45 cents is 90 cents, so 20 apples would be 900 cents, which is $9.00. Okay, so that's correct.

But wait, the problem says Becky received a $1 discount. So, does that mean she got $1 off her total? So, her total before discount was $9.00, and then she got a $1 discount. So, her total cost would be 9.00 - 1.00 = $8.00. So, Becky paid $8.000 for the apples.

Now, let's move on to Kelly. She bought 20 apples for 50 cents each. So, similar to Becky, let's compute her total before any discounts. 20 apples * $0.50/apple.

20 * 50 is 1000 cents, which is $10.00. So, her total before discount is $10.00. But she received a 10% discount. So, I need to calculate 10% of $10.00 and subtract that from her total.

10% of 10 is 1.00, so her total after discount is 10.00 - 1.00 = $9.00. So, Kelly paid $9.00 for the apples.

Now, the question is asking how much more Kelly paid than Becky. So, I need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total.

Kelly paid $9.00, Becky paid $8.00. So, 9.00 - 8.00 = $1.00.

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.000 more than Becky.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Becky: 20 apples at 45 cents each. 20 * 45. Let me compute 20 * 45. 20 * 40 is 880, and 20 * 5 is 110, so 880 + 110 is 990 cents, which is $9.90. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, 22 * 45 is 990 cents, which is $9.90. So, that's $9.90 before discount. Then, she got a $1 discount, so 9.90 - 1.00 = 8.90, which is $8.90.

Wait, so earlier I thought it was $9.00, but actually, 22 * 45
