Q: Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how long it takes Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp based on her peeling and sautéing rates.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the cooking time for 90 shrimp, I'll calculate the time required for each task separately.

For peeling:
- 6 shrimp per minute means she can peel 90 shrimp in 15 minutes.

For cooking:
- 30 shrimp in 10 minutes means she can cook 90 shrimp in 5 minutes.

Adding both times together, it will take Emily a total of 10 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we'll analyze her peeling and cooking rates separately and then combine the results.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Time to Peel 99 Shrimp**
- **Rate of Peeling:** Emily can peel **6 shrimp per minute**.
- **Total Shrimp to Peel:** 99 shrimp.

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total Shrimp}}{\text{Peeling Rate}} = \frac{99}{6} = 16.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Time to Cook 99 Shrimp**
- **Rate of Cooking:** Emily can **sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes**.
- **Total Shrimp to Cook:** 99 shrimp.

First, find the cooking rate per minute:

\[
\text{Cooking Rate} = \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ shrimp per minute}
\]

Now, calculate the time needed to cook 99 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = \frac{\text{Total Shrimp}}{\text{Cooking Rate}} = \frac{99}{3} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Step 3: Combine the Two Times**
Emily needs to both peel and cook the shrimp. Since these tasks can be done simultaneously, we add the two times together:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook} = 16.5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 19.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{19.5 \text{ minutes}}
\]
