Q: 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?

Okay, so I have this problem about cheerleaders building a human pyramid, and I need to figure out how tall the pyramid is in feet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th is 60 inches tall. So, in total, there are 10 cheerleaders, with 9 being 64 inches and 1 being 60 inches. That means the heights are mostly around 64 inches, but there's one who's a bit shorter.

Now, they build a human pyramid where the structure is as follows: starting from the bottom, there are 4 girls. Then, on top of those 4, there are 3 girls. Then, on top of those 3, there are 2 girls, and finally, the very top is the shortest girl. So, the pyramid has 4 layers: 4, 3, 2, and 1.

I need to figure out the total height of the pyramid. Since each layer is built on top of the layer below, I think the height of the pyramid would be the sum of the heights of all the girls in each layer. But wait, is that correct? Or is it the height of each individual in the pyramid, considering that each layer is a certain height?

Hmm, maybe I need to think about it differently. Each layer is a certain height, and the total height of the pyramid would be the height of the base layer plus the heights of the layers above. But actually, no, that doesn't make sense because each layer is built on top of the one below, so the height of the pyramid would be the height of the base layer, which is 4 girls, each 64 inches tall. But wait, that seems too straightforward.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because each subsequent layer is built on top of the previous one, so the height of each layer is the height of the person standing on top of them. So, the bottom layer is 4 girls, each 64 inches tall, so the base of the pyramid is 4*64 inches. Then, the next layer is 3 girls, each 64 inches tall, so that layer is 3*64 inches. Then, the next layer is 2 girls, each 64 inches tall, so 2*64 inches. Finally, the top layer is 1 girl, 60 inches tall.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because each layer is built on top of the one below, so the height of the pyramid would be the height of the base layer, which is 4*64 inches, plus the height of the next layer, which is 3*64 inches, and so on. But that would be adding up all the layers, which would give the total height of the pyramid.

Wait, but actually, each layer is a certain height, and the total height of the pyramid is the height of the base layer. Because the base layer is the widest part, and the height of the pyramid is determined by how tall the base is. So, if the base is 4 girls, each 64 inches tall, then the base is 4*64 inches tall. Then, the next layer is 3 girls, each 64 inches tall, so that layer is 3*64 inches tall, but since it's on top of the base, the total height of the pyramid would be the base height plus the height of the next layer. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the next layer is on top of the base, so the total height would be the base height plus the height of the next layer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If each layer is built on top of the one below, then the height of the pyramid is the height of the base layer. Because the base is the widest part, and the height of the pyramid is how tall the base is. So, if the base is 4 girls, each 64 inches tall, then the base is 4*64 inches tall. Then, the next layer is 3 girls, each 64 inches tall, so that layer is 3*64 inches tall, but since it's on top of the base, the total height of the pyramid would be the base height plus the height of the next layer. But that would be 4*64 + 3*64 inches, which is 7*64 inches. But that seems too tall because the top layer is 60 inches.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.
