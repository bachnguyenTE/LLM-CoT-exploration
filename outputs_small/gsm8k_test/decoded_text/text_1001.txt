Q: Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?

Okay, so Jordan wants to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake. She needs to figure out the latest time she can start making the cake so that it's ready to serve at 5:00 pm. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the cake-making process has several steps: making the batter, baking the cake, cooling it, and frosting it. Each of these steps takes a certain amount of time. Let me list out the times for each step:

1. Baking the batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Wait, the user wrote "20 minutes" and "30 minutes," but in the original problem, it's written as 20 minutes and 30 minutes. I think that's a typo, probably meant 20 minutes and 30 minutes. So, batter: 20 minutes, cake: 30 minutes. Cooling: 2 hours, frosting: 10 minutes.

So, the total time from start to finish is 20 + 30 + 120 +10 minutes. Let me calculate that:

20 minutes is 20, which is 20 minutes? Wait, no, 20 minutes is 20 minutes? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 20 minutes is 20 minutes, but 30 minutes is 30 minutes. So, 20 + 30 is 53 minutes, and 2 hours is 120 minutes, and 10 minutes is 10 minutes. So total time is 53 + 120 +10 = 183 minutes.

Wait, 20 + 30 is 50, plus 120 is 170, plus 10 is 180 minutes. Wait, 20 + 30 is 50, 50 + 120 is 170, 170 +10 is 180 minutes. So total time is 180 minutes, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.

So, Jordan needs 1 hour and 20 minutes from the start of making the cake until it's ready to serve at 5:00 pm.

Therefore, to find the latest start time, we need to subtract 1 hour and 20 minutes from 5:00 pm.

Let me do that calculation. 5:00 pm minus 1 hour is 4:00 pm. Then, minus 20 minutes, so 4:00 pm. But wait, 1 hour and 20 minutes is 80 minutes, so 5:00 pm minus 1 hour is 4:00 pm, minus 20 minutes is 3:40 pm.

Wait, let me double-check that. If she starts at 3:40 pm, then 1 hour and 20 minutes later would be 5:00 pm. So, yes, that makes sense.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. The cake needs to be ready at 5:00 pm, so the last step is frosting, which takes 10 minutes. So, the cake needs to be ready by 4:50 pm to allow 10 minutes to frost it. So, the last step is at 4:50 pm.

But before that, it needs to cool for 2 hours. So, the cake needs to be ready by 4:50 pm minus 2 hours, which is 2:55 pm. So, the cake needs to be ready by 2:55 pm to allow 2 hours to cool.

Then, before that, it needs to bake for 30 minutes. So, the cake needs to be ready by 2:55 pm minus 30 minutes, which is 2:25 pm. So, the cake needs to be ready by 2:25 pm to allow 30 minutes to bake.

Then, before that, it needs to be made for 20 minutes. So, the cake needs to be ready by 2:25 pm minus 20 minutes, which is 2:05 pm.

Wait, so if she starts making the cake at 2:05 pm, it will take 20 minutes to make the batter, then 30 minutes to bake, then 120 minutes to cool, and then 10 minutes to frost. Let me add those up:

20 + 30 + 120 +10 = 183 minutes, which
