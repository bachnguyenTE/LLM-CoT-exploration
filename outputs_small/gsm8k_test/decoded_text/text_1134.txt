Q: Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks. If she continues to save the same amount each week, how many more weeks will it take for her to have saved a total of $60?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Jane saves each week. She has saved $4 over 8 weeks, so her weekly savings amount to $4 divided by 8 weeks, which is $0.50 per week.

Next, I'll calculate how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. Subtracting her current savings of $4 from the target of $60 leaves her needing an additional $62.

Finally, to find out how many more weeks she needs to save, I'll divide the additional amount required, $62, by her weekly savings rate, $0.50. This results in 124 weeks.

**Solution:**

Jane saves **\$4** every week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save to reach a total of **\$60**, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the additional amount needed:**
   
   \[
   \$60 - \$4 = \$62
   \]

2. **Determine how many weeks are needed to save the additional amount:**
   
   \[
   \frac{\$62}{\$0.50 \text{ per week}} = 124 \text{ weeks}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{124}
\]
