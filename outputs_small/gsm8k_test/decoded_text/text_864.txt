Q: George, a grade six teacher, ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so George ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic. There are 50 students, and each student gets ten burritos. Then Mr. George eats 20 of them. I need to find out how many burritos are left after everyone has their share. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many burritos the students will eat. There are 50 students, and each gets 10 burritos. So, I can calculate the total number of burritos the students eat by multiplying the number of students by the number of burritos each gets. That would be 50 times 10. Let me write that out:

50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Okay, so the students eat 550 burritos. Now, George ordered 600 burritos in total. So, to find out how many are left after the students have eaten, I need to subtract the number of burritos the students ate from the total number ordered. That would be:

660 burritos (total ordered) - 550 burritos (students ate) = 110 burritos.

Wait, hold on, 660 minus 550. Let me do that subtraction carefully. 660 minus 550. Starting from the units place: 6 minus 5 is 1. Then the tens place: 6 minus 5 is 1. Then the hundreds place: 6 minus 5 is 1. So, 660 minus 550 is 110. So, 110 burritos left? Wait, 660 minus 550 is 110? Hmm, let me check that again because 550 plus 110 is 661, which is not 660. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Let me try another way. 660 minus 550. Let's break it down:

660 minus 500 is 160. Then, subtract the remaining 50 burritos: 160 minus 50 is 110. So, 660 minus 550 is 110. So, 110 burritos left. Okay, that makes more sense because 550 plus 110 is 660. So, 110 is the correct number.

But wait, hold on, Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. So, do I need to subtract that as well? The question says, "calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic." So, does that include Mr. George's share? Let me read the question again.

"Calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?" So, it's the leftover after everyone has their share, which includes the students and Mr. George. So, yes, I think I need to subtract both the students' share and Mr. George's share.

So, the students ate 550, Mr. George ate 20, so total eaten is 550 + 20 = 570 burritos. Then, subtract that from the total ordered: 660 - 570 = 90.

Wait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 110, but now it's 90. Which one is correct?

Let me go back to the question. It says, "calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic." So, the leftover is after all the students and Mr. George have eaten. So, yes, I need to subtract both the students' share and Mr. George's share.

So, let's recalculate:

Total ordered: 660

Students ate: 550

Mr. George ate: 20

Total eaten: 550 + 20 = 570

Leftover: 660 - 570 = 90.

So, 90 leftover burritos.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 110. So, which is correct? Let me check the initial calculation.

Total ordered: 660

Students ate: 550

Leftover after students: 660 - 550 = 110

Then, Mr. George ate 20, so leftover after Mr. George: 110 - 20 = 90.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the leftover is 90.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought 660 - 550 is 110,
