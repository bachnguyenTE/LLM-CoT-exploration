Okay, so I have this problem here where a family of parents and a child go to the cinema. The adult ticket costs $12, and a child ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3. I need to figure out how much they pay in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's identify the different items they are purchasing. There are two types of tickets: adult and child. The family consists of parents and a child, so that's three people in total. Wait, hold on, is it three people or two parents and one child? The problem says a family of parents and a child, so that should be two parents and one child, making it three people. So, two adults and one child.

Now, the cost for each adult ticket is $12. So, for two adults, that would be 2 multiplied by $12. Let me write that down: 2 * $12. Let me calculate that. 2 times 12 is 24. So, the cost for the adults is $24.

Next, the child ticket is $8. Since there's only one child, that's just $8. So, the cost for the child is $8.

Now, let's add up the cost of the tickets. The adults cost $24 and the child costs $8. So, 24 + 8. Hmm, 24 plus 8 is 32. So, the total cost for the tickets is $32.

But wait, the problem also mentions buying 2 popcorns, each costing $3. So, I need to calculate the cost of the popcorns as well. Each popcorn is $3, and they buy two of them. So, that's 2 * $3. Let me compute that: 2 * 3 is 6. So, the cost for the popcorns is $6.

Now, to find the total amount they pay, I need to add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns together. The tickets cost $32 and the popcorns cost $6. So, 32 + 6. Let me add that up. 32 plus 6 is 38. So, the total amount they pay is $38.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, two adults at $12 each: 2*12=24. One child at $8: 8. So, 24+8=32. Then, two popcorns at $3 each: 2*3=6. 32+6=38. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding all the costs together. So, 2 adults: 2*12=24, 1 child: 8, 2 popcorns: 6. So, 24+8=32, 32+6=38. Yep, same result.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward: calculate the cost of tickets and popcorns separately and then add them together. So, the total is $38.

**Final Answer**
The total amount they pay is \boxed{38} dollars.

The family consists of two parents and one child. The cost for adult tickets is $12 each, and the cost for a child ticket is $8. They also buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3.

First, calculate the cost for the adult tickets:
\[
2 \text{ adults} \times \$12 = 2 \times 12 = \$24
\]

Next, calculate the cost for the child ticket:
\[
1 \text{ child} \times \$8 = 8
\]

Add the cost of the tickets together:
\[
\$24 + \$8 = \$32
\]

Then, calculate the cost for the popcorns:
\[
2 \text{ popcorns} \times \$3 = 2 \times 3 = \$6
\]

Finally, add the cost of the popcorns to the total cost of the tickets:
\[
\$32 + \$6 = \$38
\]

The total amount they pay is \boxed{38} dollars.
