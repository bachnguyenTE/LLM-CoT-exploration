Q: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jerome and his friends coming to visit. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that there are 4 friends who came to visit. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. Hmm, okay, so that's straightforward. So, Friend 1 pressed 20 times.

Then, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Hmm, so I need to calculate 1/4 more than 20. Let me write that down. If the first friend pressed 20 times, then 1/4 of that is 20 divided by 4, which is 5. So, 1/4 more would be 20 + 5, which is 27. So, Friend 2 pressed 27 times.

Next, the third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Wait, hold on, the problem says 10 times more, but that seems like a typo because 10 is the same as 10. Maybe it's supposed to be 10 times more? Or maybe it's 10 times more? Let me check the original problem again. It says, "The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend." Yeah, so it's 10 times more. So, Friend 3 pressed 10 times more than Friend 4.

But wait, Friend 4 pressed 60 times. So, if Friend 3 pressed 10 times more than Friend 4, that would be 60 +10*60? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 10 times more would mean multiplying by 10, so 60*10=600. But that seems like a lot. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe it's 10 times more than the fourth friend, meaning 10 times the number of presses. So, if Friend 4 pressed 60 times, then Friend 3 pressed 60*10=600 times. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says, "The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend." So, "10 times more" is a bit ambiguous. It could mean 10 times as many as the fourth friend, which would be 60*10=600, or it could mean 10 times as many as the fourth friend plus the fourth friend, which would be 60+60=120. But in common language, "10 times more" usually means 10 times as many, not 10 times more than the original. So, I think it's 60*10=600.

So, Friend 3 pressed 600 times.

Wait, but let me double-check. If Friend 4 pressed 60, then 10 times more would be 60 + (10*60)=60+600=660. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 10 times more is 10 times the original. So, 10*60=600. So, Friend 3 pressed 600 times.

So, now, let's summarize:

Friend 1: 20 presses

Friend 2: 27 presses

Friend 3: 600 presses

Friend 4: 60 presses

Wait, but the problem says the third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, if Friend 4 pressed 60 times, then Friend 3 pressed 60*10=660 times? Wait, hold on, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?"

Wait, so Friend 4 pressed 60 times, and Friend 3 pressed 10 times more than Friend 4. So, 11 times more than Friend 4 would be 60 + (1*60)=126? Or is it 11 times more, meaning 11 times the number of presses? So, 11*60=66. That doesn't make sense because 11 times more would be 66, but 11 times more is ambiguous.

Wait, maybe it's 10 times more, but the problem says
