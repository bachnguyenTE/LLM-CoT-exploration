Q: According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total calories in the 300g bag of chips by multiplying the calories per serving by the number of servings. Since each serving has 250 calories and there are 5 servings, the total calories are 250 multiplied by 5, which equals 1250 calories.

Next, calculate the remaining calories you can consume by subtracting the calories already consumed from the daily target. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so subtracting that from 2000 gives 380 calories remaining.

Finally, find out how many grams of chips you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per gram. Since each gram of chips provides 0.1 calories, dividing 380 by 0.1 results in 3800 grams.

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie target, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Calories in the 300g Bag:**
   
   - **Calories per Serving:** 250 calories
   - **Number of Servings:** 5
   - **Total Calories:** \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories

2. **Determine the Remaining Calories You Can Consume:**
   
   - **Daily Calorie Target:** 2000 calories
   - **Calories Already Consumed:** 1800 calories
   - **Remaining Calories:** \( 2000 - 1800 = 380 \) calories

3. **Find Out How Many Grams of Chips You Can Eat:**
   
   - **Calories per Gram:** 0.1 calories
   - **Grams You Can Eat:** \( \frac{380}{0.1} = 3800 \) grams

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3800\ \text{grams}}
\]
