Q: Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?

Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes when there are 16 ounces to a pound.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to group them into boxes, each containing 8 crayons. So, I think I need to figure out how many boxes he needs. That should be the total number of crayons divided by the number of crayons per box.

So, 220 divided by 8. Wait, 220 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 8 goes into 22 two times, which is 16, subtract 16 from 22, that leaves 6. Bring down the 2, making it 62. 8 goes into 62 seven times, which is 56, subtract 56 from 62, that leaves 6. Bring down the 0, making it 60. 8 goes into 60 seven times again, which is 56, subtract 56 from 60, leaves 4. So, 222 divided by 8 is 27.75. Hmm, that's 27 boxes with 8 crayons each, which is 216 crayons, and then 6 crayons left over. Wait, but 27 boxes times 8 is 216, plus 6 is 222. So, actually, he can't have a fraction of a box, so he needs 28 boxes for the 224 crayons, but wait, 222 is 27 boxes with 6 left over. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I should just calculate how many boxes he needs. Since each box holds 8 crayons, the number of boxes is 222 divided by 8. So, 222 divided by 8 is 27.75. But you can't have a fraction of a box, so he needs 28 boxes. But wait, 28 boxes times 8 crayons each is 224, which is more than 222. So, he can't have 28 boxes because that would require 224 crayons, but he only has 222. So, maybe he can only use 27 boxes, which would hold 216 crayons, leaving 6 crayons. But the problem says he wants to separate them into groups of 8, so maybe he can't have a partial group. So, perhaps he can't use 28 boxes because that would require 224, which is more than he has. So, maybe he can only use 27 boxes, which would hold 216 crayons, leaving 6 crayons. But the problem says he wants to separate them into groups of 8, so maybe he can't have a partial group. So, perhaps he can't use 28 boxes because that would require 224, which is more than he has. So, maybe he can only use 27 boxes, which would hold 216, leaving 6.
