Q: How many girls are in the school if 40% of a school population is made up of 240 boys?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "How many girls are in the school if 40% of a school population is made up of 240 boys?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I know that percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this. The problem says that 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. So, I need to find out the total number of students in the school and then subtract the number of boys to get the number of girls.

Let me write down what I know:

- 40% of the school population = 240 boys
- Total population = ?
- Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys

So, if 40% corresponds to 240 boys, I can set up an equation where 40% of the total population equals 240. In mathematical terms, that would be:

0.40 * Total = 240

I need to solve for the Total. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 0.40.

Total = 240 / 0.40

Hmm, let me calculate that. 240 divided by 0.40. Hmm, 0.40 is the same as 40/100, which is 4/10. So, dividing by 0.40 is the same as multiplying by 10/4. Let me see:

240 * (10/4) = 240 * 2.5

Wait, 240 times 2.5. Let me compute that. 240 * 2 is 480, and 240 * 0.5 is 120. So, 480 + 120 is 600. So, 240 * 2.5 is 600.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Alternatively, I can think of 0.40 as 40%, so 40% of the total is 240. So, 40% is 240, so 1% is 240 divided by 40. Let me compute that.

240 divided by 40 is 6. So, 1% is 6. Therefore, 100% is 6*100=600. So, the total population is 600.

Wait, that's the same answer as before. So, the total number of students is 600. Then, the number of girls is total minus boys, which is 600 - 240 = 360.

So, the number of girls is 360.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify.

If 40% of 600 is 240, then 0.40 * 600 = 240. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 600, and 240 are boys, so 600 - 240 is 360 girls. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a proportion. If 40% is 240, then 1% is 6, so 100% is 600. So, girls would be 600 - 240 = 360. Yep, same answer.

Wait, another way to think about it: If 40% is 240, then 10% is 240 divided by 4, which is 60. So, 10% is 60, 20% is 120, 30% is 180, 40% is 240. So, 10% is 60, so 100% is 60*10=600. So, same result.

So, girls are 600 - 240=360.

Wait, but hold on, 40% is 240, so 10% is 60, so 100% is 600. So, girls are 600 -240=360. Yeah, that's consistent.

I think that's solid. So, the number of girls is 360.

**Final Answer**
The number of girls in the school is \boxed{360}.
