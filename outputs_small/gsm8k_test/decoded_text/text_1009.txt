Q: Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, and one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, and one-half of the students under 16 are male. In total, how many female students are enrolled at this school?

Okay, so I have this problem about Brook Hills High School with 3000 students. Let me try to figure out how many female students there are. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the school has 3000 students in total. Half of them are over 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is... let me calculate that. Half of 3000 is 1500. So, 1500 students are over 16 years old. Got that.

Now, of these 1500 students over 16, one-fourth are male. So, one-fourth of 1500 is... let me do the math. 1500 divided by 4 is 375. So, 375 male students are over 16 years old. That means the rest are female. So, 1500 minus 375 is... 1500 - 375. Let me subtract that. 1500 - 375 is 1125. Wait, no, 1500 - 375. Hmm, 1500 - 300 is 1200, and then subtract 75 more, which is 1125. So, 1125 female students over 16 years old. Okay, that's the male-female split for the older group.

Now, the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old. So, half of 3000 is 1500. So, 1500 students are under 16. And one-half of these are male. So, half of 1500 is 750. So, 750 male students are under 16. That means the rest are female. So, 1500 - 750 is... let me calculate. 1500 - 700 is 800, and then subtract 50 more, which is 750. So, 750 female students under 16.

Now, to find the total number of female students, I need add the female students over 16 and under 16. So, 1125 + 750. Let me add those together. 1125 + 700 is 1825, and then add 50 more, which is 1875. So, 1875 female students in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, total students: 3000. Half over 16: 1500. One-fourth of those are male: 375. So, 1500 - 375 is 1125. Then, half of the total are under 16: 1500. Half of those are male: 750. So, 1500 - 750 is 750. Then, 1125 + 750 is 1875. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to confirm. Let's see. If half the students are over 16, that's 1500, and one-fourth of those are male, so 375 male over 16, so 1125 female over 16. Then, the other half, 1500, are under 16, with half male, so 750 male under 16, so 750 female under 16. So, 1125 + 750 is 1875. Yeah, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions. Let's see, total students: 30000. Let me represent the number of male students and female students.

Number of male students over 16: 1/4 of 1500, which is 375. Number of male students under 16: 1/2 of 1500, which is 750. So, total male students: 375 + 750 = 1125. Therefore, total female students: 3000 - 1125 = 1875. Yep, same result.

So, I think 1875 is the correct number of female students. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the answer.
