Q: Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. How much milk does she collect every day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many sheep Mary has. She has a total of 30 sheep.

Next, she divides her sheep into two equal groups, each containing 15 sheep.

She receives 1 kilogram of milk from each group of 15 sheep. Therefore, from each group, she collects 1 kg of milk.

Finally, to find the total amount of milk she collects daily, I add the milk from both groups: 1 kg + 1 kg = 2 kg.
</think>

**Solution:**

Mary has a total of **30 sheep**.

1. **Divide the Sheep:**
   - Mary divides her sheep into two equal groups.
   - Each group has **15 sheep**.

2. **Calculate Milk from Each Group:**
   - From the first group of 15 sheep, she receives **1 kg** of milk.
   - From the second group of 15 sheep, she receives **2 kg** of milk.

3. **Total Milk Collected Daily:**
   - **1 kg + 2 kg = 3 kg**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3\ \text{kg}}
\]
