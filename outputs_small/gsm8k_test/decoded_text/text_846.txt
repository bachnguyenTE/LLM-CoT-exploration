Q: Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many groups can perform at Vicki's pop concert. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the concert is 2 hours long. Hmm, I should convert that into minutes because the other time units are in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours would be 120 minutes. Got that down.

Now, each group needs to perform, but there are some setup and exit times. Each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit. Let me add those up: 2 + 6 +2. That equals 10 minutes per group. Okay, so each group takes 10 minutes in total.

Additionally, there's a 10-minute intermission. So, that's a break between groups, right? So, the total time for each group plus the intermission would be 10 minutes (stage time) +10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes per group.

Wait, hold on. Is the intermission after each group or after the entire concert? The problem says she allows a 10-minute intermission. It doesn't specify after each group, so I think it's after the entire concert. So, the total time per group is 10 minutes, and then after that, 10 minutes. So, the total time per group including intermission is 20 minutes.

But wait, actually, the 10-minute intermission is a break between groups, not after the last group. So, if there are multiple groups, each group is followed by a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time per group is 10 minutes (stage and exit) plus 10 minutes (intermission) = 20 minutes per group.

But wait, no. Let me think again. If the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes, and each group takes 10 minutes (stage + exit) plus 10 minutes intermission. So, each group effectively takes 20 minutes. But that can't be right because 120 divided by 20 is 6, but that seems low.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit. So, that's 2 +6 +2 =10 minutes per group. Then, after each group, there's a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time per group is 10 minutes (stage + exit) +10 minutes (intermission) =20 minutes per group.

But wait, if the intermission is after each group, then the total time per group is 20 minutes, but the intermission is only after the last group. So, if there are N groups, the total time would be (N *20) +10 minutes for the intermission. But that can't be, because the intermission is only after the last group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the concert is 120 minutes, and each group takes 10 minutes (stage + exit) plus 10 minutes intermission, then each group plus intermission is 20 minutes. But if there are N groups, the total time would be (N *20) minutes. But that can't be because 20 minutes per group would make the total time way too long.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me see.

Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit. So, that's 2 +6 +2 =10 minutes per group. Then, after each group, there's a 10-minute intermission. So, the total time per group is 10 minutes (stage + exit) +10 minutes (intermission) =20 minutes per group.

But wait, if the intermission is after each group, then the total time would be (N *20) minutes. But that can't be because 20 minutes per group would make the total time way too long.

Wait, perhaps the intermission is only after the last group. So, the total time would be (N *20) +10 minutes. But that still seems too long.

Wait, maybe I need to model this differently. Let's think of each group as taking 10 minutes (stage + exit) and then a 10-minute intermission. So, each group plus intermission is 20 minutes. But if there are N groups, the total time would be (N *20) minutes. But that can't be because 20 minutes per
