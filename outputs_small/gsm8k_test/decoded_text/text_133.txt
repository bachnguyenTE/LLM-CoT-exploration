Q: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Walt walking miles over three days. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. That's straightforward. Then, on Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Hmm, so if he walked 4 miles on Monday, then on Tuesday, he walked 6 multiplied by that. Let me write that down.

Monday: 4 miles  
Tuesday: 6 * 4 miles

Let me calculate that. 6 times 4 is 24. So, on Tuesday, he walked 24 miles. Got that.

Now, the problem also mentions that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. So, we know the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday, and we need to find out how many he walked on Wednesday. 

Let me break this down. The total miles from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. So, if I add up the miles from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it should equal 41. 

Let me denote Wednesday's miles as W. So, the equation would be:

Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = Total  
4 + 24 + W = 41

Wait, hold on. 4 + 24 is 28. So, 28 + W = 41. To find W, I need to subtract 28 from both sides.

So, W = 41 - 28  
W = 13

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Monday: 4 miles  
Tuesday: 24 miles  
Wednesday: 13 miles  
Total: 4 + 24 + 13 = 41 miles

Yes, that adds up correctly. So, 4 + 24 is 28, and 28 + 13 is 41. Perfect, that matches the total given in the problem. 

I think that's it. So, the answer should be 13 miles on Wednesday.

**Final Answer**
Walt walked \boxed{13} miles on Wednesday.
</think>

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is calculated as follows:

\[
6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. Let \( W \) be the miles Walt walked on Wednesday. The equation for the total miles is:

\[
4 + 24 + W = 41
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
28 + W = 41
\]

Solving for \( W \):

\[
W = 41 - 28 = 13
\]

Thus, Walt walked \boxed{13} miles on Wednesday.
