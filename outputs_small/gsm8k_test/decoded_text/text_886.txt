First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The singer has 50 microphones, right? Wait, no, hold on. The problem says he has 50 microphones. Wait, that's a typo, probably should be 50. Because 50 is a bit odd, but maybe it's a typo. So, assuming it's 50 microphones, which is 50. But wait, 50 is 50, which is 50? Wait, no, 50 is 50, which is 50. Wait, no, 50 is 50, which is 50. Wait, no, 50 is 50, which is 50. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check.
