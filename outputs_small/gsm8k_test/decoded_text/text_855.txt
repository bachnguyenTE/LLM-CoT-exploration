Q: I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how old I am. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I take it slowly, I think I can handle it.

First, let me list out all the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am two years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. When we add all our ages together, the total is 87.

And the question is asking how old I am.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find my age. Let me assign variables to each of my siblings' ages to make this easier. Variables are like placeholders for numbers, so I can work with them algebraically.

Let me start by defining my variables:

- Let me call my age as "M."
- My brother's age can be called "B."
- My sister's age can be called "S."
- My mom's age can be called "Mo."

Now, let's translate the given information into equations.

1. I am three years younger than my brother. So, if I subtract 3 from my brother's age, I get my age. That would be:
   M = B - 3

2. I am two years older than my sister. So, if I subtract 2 from my sister's age, I get my age. That would be:
   M = S + 2

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. So, if I take three times my brother's age and subtract 1, I get my mom's age. That would be:
   Mo = 3B - 1

4. The sum of all our ages is 87. So, if I add up my age, my brother's age, my sister's age, and my mom's age, it equals 87. That would be:
   M + B + S + Mo = 87

Alright, so now I have four equations:

1. M = B - 3
2. M = S + 2
3. Mo = 3B - 1
4. M + B + S + Mo = 87

So, I have four equations with four variables: M, B, S, Mo. That should be solvable.

Let me see how to approach this. Since I have expressions for M and Mo in terms of B, maybe I can substitute those into the other equations.

Starting with equation 4: M + B + S + Mo =87.

I can substitute M and Mo from equations 1 and 3 into equation 4.

So, replacing M with (B - 3) and Mo with (3B -1), equation 4 becomes:

(B - 3) + B + S + (3B -1) =87

Let me simplify that:

First, expand the terms:

B - 3 + B + S + 3B -1 =87

Now, combine like terms:

B + B + 3B is 5B.

-3 -1 is -4.

So, 5B + S -4 =87

Then, add 4 to both sides:

5B + S =87 +4

5B + S =91

So, equation 4 simplifies to 5B + S =91.

Hmm, okay. So, now I have 5B + S =91.

But I also have equation 2: M = S +2. So, maybe I can express S in terms of M, but I don't know M yet.

Wait, maybe I can express S in terms of B as well.

From equation 2: S = M -2.

But from equation 1: M = B -3.

So, substituting M into equation 2:

S = (B -3) -2 = B -5.

So, S = B -5.

Alright, so now I have S in terms of B: S = B -5.

So, going back to equation 4, which is 5B + S =91.

But since S = B -5, substitute that into equation 4:

5B + (B -5) =91

Simplify:

5B + B -5 =91

6B -5 =91

Add 5 to both sides:

6B =91 +5

6B =96

Divide both sides by 6:

B =96 /6

B=13

Wait, so my brother is 13 years old?

Let me check that.

If B=13, then from equation 1: M =13 -3=10.

So, I am 1
