Q: Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Candy and her thread spools. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says she has different colored spools: 15 light blue, 45 dark blue, 40 light green, and 50 dark green. And the question is asking what percent of her spools are blue. Hmm, okay.

Alright, so I think I need to find the total number of spools she has and then figure out how many of those are blue. Then, to find the percentage, I can use the formula: (number of blue spools / total spools) * 100%. That makes sense.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. She has:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

So, first, I should add all these up to get the total number of spools. Let me do that.

15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green). Let me add them one by at a time.

15 + 45 is 60. Then, 60 + 40 is 100. Wait, no, 60 + 40 is 100? Wait, 60 + 40 is 100? Hmm, no, 60 + 40 is 100, and 6 + 4 is 10, so 100 + 10 is 110? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 15 + 45 is 60, then 60 + 40 is 100, and 100 + 50 is 150. Wait, 15 + 45 is 60, 60 + 40 is 100, 100 + 50 is 150. Yeah, that's correct. So total spools are 150.

Now, how many are blue? She has light blue and dark blue. So that's 15 + 45. Let me add those. 15 + 45 is 60. So, 60 blue spools.

So, the number of blue spools is 60, and the total spools are 150. So, to find the percentage, I can do (60 / 150) * 100%.

Let me compute 60 divided by 150. Hmm, 60 divided by 150. Well, 60 is a third of 150 because 150 divided by 3 is 50, so 60 is 10 more than 50, which is 1/3. So, 60 is 40% of 150? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 60 divided by 150 is equal to 0.4, right? Because 150 times 0.4 is 62, which is not 60. Wait, maybe I should do it another way.

Let me do 60 divided by 150. So, 60 ÷ 150. Let me simplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 15. 60 ÷15 is 4, and 150 ÷15 is 10. So, 4/10, which is 0.4. So, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4 is 40%? Wait, no, 0.4
