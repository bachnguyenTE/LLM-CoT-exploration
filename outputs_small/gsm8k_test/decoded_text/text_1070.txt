Q: Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants that he makes.  He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.  The grocery store currently has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off.  If the butter costs $4.00 a pound, how much will it cost him to purchase 6 pounds of butter?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dennis making croissants, and I need to figure out how much it will cost him to buy 6 pounds of butter. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants he makes. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Hmm, so if each dozen requires 1 pound, then 6 dozen would require 6 pounds of butter, right? Let me write that down:

Number of dozens needed = 6
Butter per dozen = 1 pound
Total butter needed = 6 * 1 = 6 pounds

Okay, so he needs 6 pounds of butter. Now, the grocery store has a promotion: buy one pound, get half off. The regular price is $4.00 per pound. I need to figure out how much it will cost him with this promotion.

Wait, the promotion is "buy one pound, get one half off." So, for every pound he buys, he gets an additional pound at half price. That means for every two pounds, he pays full price for the first and half price for the second. Let me think about how that works.

If he buys 1 pound, he pays $4.00. If he buys 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. Similarly, for 3 pounds, it would be 2 sets of 1 pound each, so 2*$4.00 + 1*$2.00 = $12.00 + $2.00 = $14.00. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Actually, the promotion is "buy one pound, get one half off." So, for every pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, if he buys 1 pound, he gets 1 pound at half price. So, for 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. For 3 pounds, he would pay $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 = $10.00. Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as for every pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, for every two pounds, he pays full price for the first and half price for the second. So, for 2 pounds, it's $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00. For 3 pounds, it's 2 sets of 1 pound each, so 2*$4.00 + 1*$2.00 = $8.00 + $2.00 = $10.00. Wait, that seems correct.

But in the problem, he needs 6 pounds. So, let's see how many sets of 2 pounds he can buy. 6 divided by 2 is 3. So, he can buy 3 sets of 2 pounds each. Each set costs $6.00. So, 3 sets would be 3*$6.00 = $18.00.

Wait, but let me verify that. If he buys 2 pounds, it's $6.00. Then, buying another 2 pounds, it's another $6.00, and another 2 pounds, another $6.00. So, 3 sets would be 3*$6.00 = $18.00. That seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for every pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, for 6 pounds, he would be paying full price for 5 pounds and half price for 1 pound. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the promotion is "buy one, get one half off." So, for every pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, if he buys 6 pounds, he would get 6 pounds at half price? That doesn't make sense because the promotion is "buy one, get one half off." So, for each pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, for 6 pounds, he would be paying full price for 5 pounds and half price for 1 pound. Wait, that seems more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as for every pound he buys, he gets another pound at half price. So, for 1 pound, he pays full. For 2 pounds, he pays full for the first and half for the second. For 3 pounds, he pays full for the first two and half for the third.
