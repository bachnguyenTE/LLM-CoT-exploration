Q: Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. If she continues to walk dogs at the same rate, how much would she earn after 12 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine Ella's hourly rate by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours she worked. She earned $333 for 3 hours, so her hourly rate is $33 divided by 3, which equals $11 per hour.

Next, to find out how much she would earn after working 12 hours at the same rate, I multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours. That is, $11 multiplied by 12 hours, resulting in $132.

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after working for 12 hours.

**Solution:**

Ella earns money by dog walking at a constant rate. To find out how much she would earn after working for 12 hours, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Ella's hourly rate:**
   
   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours Worked}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate earnings for 12 hours:**
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 Hours} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Total Hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{132}
