Q: Every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a car's tires and how many years before they need to be replaced. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that every 2 miles, a car drives its tires and they rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. I need to find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced. Hmm, okay.

Let me break this down. I think I need to find out how many rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a year and then see how many years it takes for them to reach the maximum number of rotations before replacement. That makes sense.

So, first, let's find out how many rotations happen per mile. The problem says every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, if I can find rotations per mile, that might help. 

If every 2 miles, it's 725 rotations, then per mile, it would be 725 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 725 ÷ 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile. Okay, so every mile, the tires rotate 362.5 times.

Now, Jeremy drives 4000 miles a month. So, to find the number of rotations per month, I can multiply the rotations per mile by the number of miles driven each month. That would be 362.5 rotations/mile × 4400 miles/month. Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me compute that.

Wait, 362.5 multiplied by 4400. Let me see, 362.5 is the same as 362 and a half, right? So, 362.5 × 4400. Maybe I can break this down. 362.5 × 4400. Hmm, 362.5 is 362.5, so 362.5 × 4400.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 4400 as 44 × 100, so 362.5 × 44 × 100. Let me compute 362.5 × 44 first. 362.5 × 40 is 14,500, and 362.5 × 4 is 1,450. So, adding those together, 14,500 + 1,450 = 15,950. Then, multiply by 100, which is 1,595,000. So, 362.5 × 4400 = 1,595,000 rotations per month.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my math again. 362.5 × 4400. Maybe I should do it differently. 362.5 × 4400 is the same as 362.5 × 44 × 100. So, 362.5 × 44 is 15,950, as I had before, and then times 100 is 1,595,000. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, Jeremy's tires rotate 1,595,000 times per month. Now, each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. So, how many months until the tires reach that number?

To find the number of months, I can divide the total rotations by the monthly rotations. So, 10,440,000 ÷ 1,595,000. Let me compute that.

First, let me write both numbers out:

10,440,000 ÷ 1,595,000.

Hmm, both numbers are in thousands, so maybe I can simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 1,000. So, that becomes 10,440 ÷ 1,595.

Wait, 10,440 ÷ 1,595. Let me see if I can simplify this fraction. Let's see if both numbers are divisible by 5. 10,440 ÷ 5 is 2,088, and 1,595 ÷5 is 319. So, now it's 2,088 ÷ 319.

Hmm, 319 goes
