Q: The light on a lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. How long will it take the light to blink 459 times?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute, I'll divide the total number of blinks by the total time in minutes.

Next, I'll calculate the total time required for the light to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate per minute.

Finally, I'll present the calculated time in minutes.

To determine how long it will take for the lighthouse's light to blink 459 times, follow these steps:

1. **Find the blinking rate:**
   
   The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find the rate per minute:
   
   \[
   \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time for 459 blinks:**
   
   Using the rate of 51 blinks per minute:
   
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{9 \text{ minutes}}
\]
