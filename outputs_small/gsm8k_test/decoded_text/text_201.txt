Q: John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?

Okay, so I have this problem here where John won an award at work. The award gives him a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in his salary. He makes $2000 a week, and he gets this raise every week throughout the year. The award was given on the first day of the year. The question is asking how much money John made that year. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the components of John's earnings. He gets a one-time monetary reward of $5000. That seems straightforward. Then, he gets a 5% raise every week. So, his salary increases by 5% each week. He makes $2000 a week, and this happens every week throughout the year. The award was given on the first day of the year, so I assume that means he gets the raise on the first day, and then continues to get the raise every week after that.

Wait, so does that mean he gets the 5% raise every week, starting from the first day? So, on the first day, he gets the 5% raise, and then every subsequent week, he gets a 5% raise on his current salary. So, his salary increases each week, not just once at the end of the year.

So, to calculate his total earnings for the year, I need to consider two parts: the one-time monetary reward and the total salary he earned throughout the year with the weekly raises.

Let me break it down. The monetary reward is $5000, which is a one-time amount, so that's easy. The main part is calculating his total salary for the year.

He makes $2000 a week, and he gets a 5% raise every week. So, his salary increases each week. So, the first week, he makes $2000, the second week, he makes 5% more than that, the third week, 5% more than the second week, and so on.

So, this is a case of compound interest, where each week his salary is multiplied by 1.05 (since 5% raise is the same as multiplying by 1.05). So, his salary each week is 2000 * (1.05)^(n-1), where n is the week number.

Therefore, to find his total salary for the year, I need to calculate the sum of his weekly salaries for 52 weeks, starting from $2000 and increasing by 5% each week.

So, the formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 is $2000, r is 1.05, and n is 52 weeks.

So, plugging in the numbers, the total salary S would be 2000*(1.05^52 - 1)/(1.05 - 1). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute 1.05^52. That's a big exponent. I might need to use logarithms or a calculator for that. Alternatively, I can approximate it, but since it's a precise calculation, I should use a calculator.

Wait, but since I'm just thinking through this, maybe I can recall that 1.05^52 is 1.05^52. Let me compute that step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. So, S = 2000*(1.05^52 - 1)/0.05.

Wait, 1.05 - 1 is 0.05, so denominator is 0.05.

So, S = 2000*(1.05^52 - 1)/0.05.

But 2000 divided by 0.05 is 2000 * 2 = 4000.

So, S = 4000*(1.05^52 - 1).

So, now I need to compute 1.05^52.

Hmm, 1.05^52. Let me see, 1.05^10 is approximately 1.62889, 1.05^20 is approximately 3.392916, 1.05^30 is approximately 6.324598, 1.05^40 is approximately 13.200996, and
