Q: Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Okay, so Millie is opening a lemonade stand and wants to figure out her profit per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand all the costs and revenues involved.

She spends $18 to buy enough supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, let me calculate the total number of cups she can make. If one pitcher is 12 cups, then 3 pitchers would be 3 times 12, which is 36 cups. Wait, 3 times 12 is 36? Yeah, 12, 24, 36. So, she can make 36 cups of lemonade? That seems a bit low, but okay, maybe she can make more if she makes multiple pitchers. Anyway, moving on.

She sells each cup for $1. So, each cup brings in $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. So, in one hour, she sells 4 cups. Since each cup is $1, her revenue per hour is 4 times $1, which is $4. That seems straightforward.

Now, her total cost is $18 for the supplies. But wait, is that a one-time cost or a cost per hour? The question says she spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers. So, that's a one-time expense. So, she has to pay $18 upfront to make the lemonade. But she sells it, so maybe that cost is spread out over the time she's running the stand.

The question is asking for her profit per hour she spends running the lemonade stand. So, I think we need to figure out how much she makes per hour after covering her costs.

First, let's figure out how much she makes per hour. She sells 4 cups per hour, each cup for $1, so $4 per hour. Then, her total cost is $18. So, if she sells all the lemonade, how much does she make in total?

Wait, she can make 36 cups, right? Because 3 pitchers, each 12 cups? Wait, no, each pitcher is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, 1 pitcher is 12 cups? Wait, no, 1 pitcher is 12 cups. So, 3 pitchers would be 36 cups. Wait, 12 cups is 12 cups? No, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups? Wait, no, 12 cups is 12 cups. So, 3 pitchers would be 36 cups. So, 36 cups total.

So, she sells 4 cups per hour, so how many hours does it take her to sell all 36 cups? Let me calculate that. 36 cups divided by 4 cups per hour is 9 hours. So, she needs 9 hours to sell all the lemonade.

So, her total revenue is 9 hours times $4 per hour, which is $36. Her total cost is $18. So, her profit is total revenue minus total cost, which is $36 minus $18, which is -$12. Wait, that can't be right. She's making $36, but she spent $18. So, she actually has a loss of $12.

But the question is asking for her profit per hour she spends running the lemonade stand. So, if she's making $36 in 9 hours, that's $0.33 per hour. But she spent $18, so maybe the $18 is a one-time cost, and the $10 is the cost per hour? Wait, no, the problem says she spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers. So, that's a one-time cost.

So, maybe the $18 is a fixed cost, and she has variable costs? Or is it just a fixed cost? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's a fixed cost. So, she has to pay $18 regardless of how much she sells.

So, her total revenue is $36, and her total cost is $18, so her profit is -$12. But the question is asking for her profit per hour she spends running the lemonade stand. So,
