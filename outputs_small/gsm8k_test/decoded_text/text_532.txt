Q: Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. How many years separate the age of the two now? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, right now, how old is Jame? If in 5 years he'll be 27, then right now he must be 27 minus 5. Let me write that down:

Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Okay, so Jame is 22 now. Now, moving on to his cousin. It says, "In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age." Hmm, okay. So, let's break that down.

First, in 8 years, the cousin's age will be... Well, let's denote the cousin's current age as C. So, in 8 years, the cousin will be C + 8 years old.

Now, it says that this cousin's age in 8 years will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age is 2 * 22, which is 44. Then, 5 years younger than that would be 44 - 5 = 39.

So, in 8 years, the cousin will be 39 years old. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

C + 8 = 39

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from both sides:

C = 39 - 8 = 31

So, the cousin is currently 31 years old. Wait, that seems a bit young for a cousin, but okay, maybe it's a baby or something. Anyway, moving on.

Now, the question is asking how many years separate the age of the two now. So, that would be the difference between the cousin's current age and Jame's current age.

So, let's compute that:

Cousin's age - Jame's age = 31 - 22 = -9

Wait, that can't be right. A negative number doesn't make sense in this context. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back and check. So, Jame is 22 now. In 8 years, he'll be 22 + 8 = 30. The cousin in 8 years will be 5 years younger than twice his age. So, twice 30 is 60, minus 5 is 55. So, cousin in 8 years will be 55. Therefore, cousin's current age is 55 - 8 = 47.

Wait, hold on, that's different from before. So, if in 8 years, cousin is 55, then now she is 55 - 8 = 47. So, cousin is 47 now, and Jame is 22 now. So, the difference is 47 -22 = 25 years.

Wait, so earlier I thought cousin was 31, but that was incorrect. Let me see where I went wrong.

I think I misapplied the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

"In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age."

So, twice his age in 8 years. So, twice what? Is it twice his current age or twice his age in 8 years?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "twice his age." So, it's twice his age in 8 years. So, if in 8 years, his age is C + 8, then twice that is 2*(C + 8). Then, 5 years younger than that would be 2*(C + 8) -5.

So, the cousin's age in 8 years is 2*(C + 8) -5.

So, let me write that equation:

C + 8 = 2*(C + 8) -5

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

"In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age."

So, cousin's age in 8 years = 2*(Jame's age in 8 years) -5

So, cousin's age in 8 years = 2*(J +8) -5, where J is Jame's current age.

But we know that J is 22, so:

Cousin's age in 8 years = 2*(22 +8) -5 = 2*(30) -5 = 60 -5 =55
