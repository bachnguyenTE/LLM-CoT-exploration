Q: A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  How many sunflower seeds are there altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about sunflowers and their seeds. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small one. I need to find the total number of seeds altogether. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I know that a dozen is 12, so 3 dozen seeds would be 3 times 12. Let me write that out: 3 × 12. Let me calculate that. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 2 is 6, so 30 + 6 is 39. So, a small sunflower has 39 seeds. That seems right.

Now, the large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small one. Hmm, okay, so I need to find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds and then add that to the original number. Wait, 50% is a bit confusing because it's written as 50, not 50%. Maybe that's a typo? Let me check the problem again. It says 50% more seeds. So, it's 50%, which is 50 per 100, or 50/100. Let me convert that to a decimal to make it easier.

50% as a decimal is 0.50. Wait, no, that's not right. 50% is 50 per 100, which is 50/100, which is 0.5. Wait, no, 50% is 50 per 100, so 50/100, which is 0.5. So, 50% is 0.5. So, 50% more seeds would be 0.5 times the number of seeds in the small sunflower.

So, the small sunflower has 39 seeds. So, 50% more would be 39 + (0.5 × 39). Let me calculate 0.5 × 39. Half of 39 is 19.5, right? So, 39 + 19.5 is 58.5. So, the large sunflower has 58.5 seeds? Wait, that can't be right because seeds are whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 50% more seeds. So, 50% of 39 is 19.5, so adding that to 39 gives 58.5. But seeds can't be half. Maybe I need to reconsider. Is 50% more seeds 50% more than the small one, or is it 50% of the small one? Let me read the problem again.

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower." So, it's 50% more than the small one. So, 50% of 39 is 19.5, so 39 + 19.5 is 58.5. Hmm, that's still a fraction. Maybe I should think of it as 50% more, which is 1.5 times the original. So, 1.5 × 39. Let me calculate that.

1.5 × 39. Let's break it down: 1 × 39 is 39, and 0.5 × 39 is 19.5. So, 39 + 19.5 is 58.5. So, same result. Hmm, so that's 58.5 seeds. But that's a decimal. Maybe the problem expects a whole number? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, 3 dozen is 36, not 39. Wait, hold on, 1 dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 3 ×12, which is 36, not 39. Oh! I think I messed up there. 3 ×12 is 36, not 39. So, that was my mistake. So, the small sunflower has 36 seeds, not 39. Okay, that makes more sense.

So, 36 seeds. Then, 50% more seeds. Wait, 50% is 50 per 100, which is 0.5. So, 50% of 36 is 0.5 ×36. Let me calculate that. 0.5
