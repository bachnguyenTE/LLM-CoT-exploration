Q: Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Roger spent on buy coffee and a donut. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that Roger buys coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound. But he had to buy a more expensive brand that's 20% more expensive. Hmm, wait, is that 20% or 20 dollars? The wording says "20% more," so I think that's 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal. So, the more expensive brand is 20% more expensive than the normal brand. 

So, the normal price is $5 per pound. To find the price of the more expensive brand, I need to calculate 20% of $5 and add that to the original price. Let me write that down:

20% of $5 is 0.2 * 5 = $1.00. 

So, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1.00 = $6.00 per pound. 

Wait, hold on, 20% is 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal. So, 0.2 times 5 is 1.0, so yes, $1.0. So, the more expensive brand is $6.00 per pound. Got it.

Next, Roger buys a week's worth of coffee. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, a week is 7 days. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. 

He buys 7 pounds at $6.00 per pound. Let me calculate that:

7 * 6.00 = ?

Let me do the multiplication step by step. 7 times 6 is 42, and 7 times 0.00 is 0.21. So, adding those together, 42 + 0.21 = $42.21. 

So, the coffee costs $42.21. 

He also buys a donut for $2. So, I need to add that to the coffee cost.

Total cost = coffee cost + donut cost = $42.21 + $2.00 = $62.21.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 20% more than $5 is indeed $6.00 per pound. Then, 7 pounds would be 7 * 6.00 = $42.00. Wait, no, 7 * 6 is 42, so $42.00. Then, adding the donut, which is $2.00, so total is $42.00 + $2.00 = $48.00. 

Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the decimal point earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 20% of $5 is 1.00, so $5 + $1.00 = $6.00 per pound. Then, 7 pounds would be 7 * 6.00 = $42.00. Then, adding the donut, which is $2.00, so total is $42.00 + $2.00 = $44.00. 

Wait, so which is it? Is the more expensive brand $6.00 per pound, so 7 pounds is $42.00, plus $2.00 for the donut, totaling $44.00. 

But earlier, I thought 7 * 6.00 is $42.21, but that was a miscalculation. Let me correct that.

Wait, 6.00 per pound, so 7 * 6.00. Let me compute 7 * 6 = 42, and 7 * 0.00 = 0.21, so total is 42 + 0.21 = $42.21. So, that's $42.21 for coffee. Then, adding the donut, which is $2.00, so total is $42.21 + $2.00 = $44.21.

Wait, so which is correct? Is the more expensive brand $6.00 per pound, so 7 pounds is $42.21, or is it $6.00 per pound, so 7 pounds is $42.00?

Wait, the problem says the normal brand is $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand is 20% more. So, 20% of 5 is 1.00, so 5 +
