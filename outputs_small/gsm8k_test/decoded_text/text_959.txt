Q: Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?

Okay, so Coach brought a bag of basketballs to practice, dumped them all out, and then Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey picked them up. They all went over to the bag and carried them back. The problem says that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey. It also mentions that Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls. We need to find the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let's figure out how many balls each person carried. It says Jason carried 2 balls. Then, Jordan carried twice as many as Jason. So if Jason has 2, Jordan must have 2 times 2, which is 4. Got that. Then, Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey. So if Jason has 2, then Jeffrey must have half of that, right? So 2 divided by 2 is 1. So Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, then that means if I let Jeffrey's balls be J, then Jason's balls would be 2J. But the problem says Jason carried 2 balls, so 2J = 2. So solving for J, we get J = 1. Yeah, that makes sense. So Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

So now, we have the number of balls each person carried: Jordan has 4, Jason has 2, and Jeffrey has 1. To find the total number of balls, we just add them all together. So 4 + 2 + 1 equals... let me add that. 4 plus 2 is 6, and 6 plus 1 is 7. So the total number of balls is 7.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check. If Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, and Jason carried 2, then Jordan has 4. Then, Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so 2 is twice 1, which is correct. So adding them up: 4 + 2 +1 is indeed 7. So the total number of balls is 7.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using variables. Let me try that. Let’s let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be J. Then, Jason carried twice as many, so that's 2J. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so that's 2*(2J) = 4J. But the problem says Jason carried 2 balls, so 2J = 2. Solving for J, we get J = 1. So Jeffrey carried 1, Jason carried 2, Jordan carried 4. Adding them up: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a ratio. The ratio of balls carried by Jordan to Jason is 2:1, and Jason to Jeffrey is 2:1. So combining these ratios, the ratio of Jordan to Jason to Jeffrey is 4:2:1. So if we let the number of balls Jordan carried be 4x, Jason be 2x, and Jeffrey be x, then the total is 4x + 2x + x = 7x. But we know that Jason carried 2 balls, which is 2x. So 2x = 2, so x =1. Therefore, the total is 7x =7*1=7. So that also gives us 7.

Wait, so is the answer 7? It seems consistent across different methods. So I think that's the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \boxed{7}.

Coach brought a bag of basketballs to practice and dumped them all out. Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey picked up and carried all the balls. It is given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Jason carried 2 balls.

1. Let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( J \).
2. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we have:
   \[
   \text{Jason's balls} = 2J
   \]
3. Given that Jason carried 2 balls, we set up the equation:
   \[
   2J = 2 \implies J = 1
   \]
4. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
5. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4
   \]
6. The total number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey is:
   \[
   4 + 2 + 1 = 7
   \]

Thus, the total number of
