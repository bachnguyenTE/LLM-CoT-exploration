Q: Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, how many milliliters of water will Hannah need to drink?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 kilometers and she has to run 8 laps, I'll multiply 0.25 by 8 to find the total distance.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water required per kilometer, which is 60 milliliters.

Finally, I'll perform the multiplication to find the total milliliters of water Hannah needs to drink.

**Solution:**

Hannah needs to drink **60 ml** of water for each kilometer she runs. Her gym teacher tells her to run **8 laps**, and each lap is **0.25 km**.

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Laps} \times \text{Distance per Lap}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = \text{Total Distance} \times \text{Water per Kilometer}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{120 \text{ ml}}
\]
