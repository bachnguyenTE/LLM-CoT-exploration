Q: Josie grows grapes on her 10-acre farm.  Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.  How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes every year. Hmm, I need to figure out how many barrels of wine she gets from her farm each year. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that each acre produces 5 tons. Since she has 10 acres, I should multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre to get the total tons produced in a year. So, 10 acres times 5 tons per acre. Let me write that out: 10 * 5. Hmm, 10 times 5 is 50. So, her farm produces 50 tons of grapes each year. Wait, 50? Yeah, that seems right.

Now, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, for each ton, she gets 2 barrels. So, if she has 50 tons, each of those tons can be converted into 2 barrels. So, I need to multiply the total tons by 2 to get the total barrels. So, 50 tons * 2 barrels per ton. Let me calculate that: 50 * 2. Hmm, 50 times 2 is 100. Wait, 50 is fifty, so fifty times two is one hundred. So, 50 * 2 is 100. So, that would mean she gets 100 barrels of wine per year.

Wait, let me double-check that. 10 acres times 5 tons per acre is 50 tons. 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton is 100 barrels. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is 100.

I think that's it. So, the answer should be 100 barrels of wine per year.

**Final Answer**
Josie's farm produces \boxed{100} barrels of wine per year.

Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. To find the total barrels of wine produced, we multiply the total tons by 2:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Thus, Josie's farm produces \boxed{100} barrels of wine per year.
