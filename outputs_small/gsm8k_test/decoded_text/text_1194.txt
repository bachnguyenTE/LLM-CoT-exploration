Q: From her science class study, Brady learned that each whale in the sea has 40 gallons of blood. She also learned that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.

Okay, so I have this problem here about whales and sharks and their blood gallons. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Hmm, so if a whale has 40 gallons, a shark must have 3 times that amount. Let me write that down to make it clear.

So, for one whale: 40 gallons.

For one shark: 3 times 40 gallons. Let me calculate that. 3 multiplied by 40. Hmm, 3 times 40 is 120. So, each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Now, the question is asking for the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have. So, if one shark is 120 gallons, then ten sharks would be 10 times that amount. Let me write that out.

Number of sharks: 10.

Total blood for ten sharks: 10 multiplied by 120.

Wait, hold on, 10 times 120? That seems like a lot. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, 120 times 10. Well, 120 times 10 is 0, and 120 times 1 is 120, so adding those together, 0 + 120 is 120. So, 120 gallons? That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me double-check. If one shark is 120 gallons, then ten sharks would be 120 times 10. 120 times 10 is indeed 1200. Wait, hold on, no, that's not right. Wait, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200? Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200? Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1320? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me do the multiplication properly. 120 times 10. 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200? Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1220? Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1220? Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120, so 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1320. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120, so 120 times 10 is 132. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1320. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1320. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120, so 120 times 10 is 120. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1320. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1200. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 120. Wait, no, 120 times 10 is 1
