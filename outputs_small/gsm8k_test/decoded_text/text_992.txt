Q: Buford writes many checks every year.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  How many checks does Buford write per year?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many checks Buford writes per year. Let me break down the information given step by step.

First, the problem says that Buford writes many checks every year. Specifically, he writes a check once per month for two different expenses: the electric bill and the gas bill. So, let me think about that. If he writes a check every month for the electric bill, that's 12 checks for the electric bill. Similarly, he writes another check every month for the gas bill, which is another 12 checks. So, that's 12 + 12 = 24 checks just for the electric and gas bills.

Next, the problem mentions that he also writes a check every month for the church. It says he does this twice per month. Hmm, so that's 2 checks per month. So, for the church, that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Then, there's a mention of a check to the pest and lawn service, but it's only mentioned once every quarter year. Wait, a quarter is three months, right? So, if he writes a check quarterly, that's once every three months. So, how many times does he write that check in a year? Let me calculate that. There are 12 months in a year, so if he writes a check every 3 months, that's 12 / 3 = 4 checks per year.

Now, let me add up all these checks. So, electric and gas bills: 24 checks. Church: 24 checks. Pest and lawn service: 4 checks. So, total checks per year would be 24 + 24 + 4.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he writes a check every month for the electric bill, gas bill, and church. Then, it says he writes a check twice per month for the church. So, that's 2 checks per month, which is 24 per year. Then, the pest and lawn service is a separate check, done quarterly, so 4 per year.

So, adding them up: 24 (electric) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check. Electric and gas are both once per month, so 12 checks each, so 24. Then, church is twice per month, so 2 *12=24. Then, pest and lawn is once every quarter, so 4 times a year. So, 24 +24 +4=52. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me think again. The problem says he writes a check every month for the electric bill, gas bill, and church. So, that's 3 checks per month. So, 3 *12=36. Then, the pest and lawn service is done quarterly, which is once every 3 months, so 4 times a year. So, 36 +4=40.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? The problem says: "Twice per month he writes a check to the church." So, that's 2 checks per month. So, 2 *12=24. So, that's separate from the electric and gas bills.

So, electric and gas: 12 +12=24. Church:24. Pest and lawn:4. So, total is 24+24+4=52.

Wait, but the problem says "twice per month he writes a check to the church." So, that's 2 per month, which is 24 per year. So, that's correct.

But then, the problem also says "twice per month he writes a check to the church." So, that's 2 per month, which is 24 per year. So, that's correct.

So, adding up: electric and gas:24, church:24, pest and lawn:4. So, 24+24+4=52.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3 per month for electric, gas, and church, which would be 36, plus 4 for pest and lawn, totaling 40. But the problem says "twice per month he writes a check to the church." So, that's 2 per month, which is 24. So, that's separate.

So, the correct total is 24 (electric) +24 (church) +4 (pest and lawn) =52.

Wait, but let me read the problem again: "Twice per month he writes a check to the church." So, that's 2 per month, so 24 per
