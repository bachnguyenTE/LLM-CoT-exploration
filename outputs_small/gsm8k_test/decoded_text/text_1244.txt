Q: Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?

Okay, so Audrey has to take two math tests to move onto the 7th grade. She needs to get 70% of all the questions right in total. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% right. The second test has 40 questions, and we need to figure out how many she needs to get right on that to meet the overall 70% requirement.

First, let me break this down. She has two tests, so the total number of questions she'll have taken is 70 plus 40, which is 110 questions. To move on to 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of all these questions right. So, I should calculate 70% of 110 to find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in total.

Let me write that out: 70% of 110. To calculate percentages, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 70% is 0.70 in decimal form. Then, 0.70 multiplied by 110. Let me do that multiplication. 0.70 times 100 is 77, and 0.70 times 1 is 0.70, so adding those together gives 77.7. But since you can't answer a fraction of a question, I guess she needs to get 78 questions right in total. Wait, but maybe I should check that.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it step by step. 70% of 110 is the same as 0.70 times 110. Let me compute 111 times 0.70. So, 111 times 0.7 is 77.7, and 111 times 0.00 is 1.11. Adding those together gives 77.7 + 1.11 = 78.8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.70 times 111 is 77.7, which is 77.7, but 77.7 is 78 when rounded up. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, no, 70% of 110 is 77, and 70% of 1 is 0.7, so 77 + 0.7 is 77.7. So, 77.7 is the exact number, but since you can't have a fraction of a question, she needs to get 78 questions right in total. But wait, 77.7 is closer to 78, so she needs to get 78 correct.

But let me double-check that. 70% of 110 is 77, and 70% of 40 is 28. So, 77 plus 28 is 105. Wait, that can't be right because 70% of 110 is 77.7, which is approximately 78. But 70% of 40 is 28, so 77 + 28 is 105. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, no, hold on. The first test is 70 questions, 60% correct, so that's 42 correct. The second test is 40 questions, and we need to find x such that 42 + x = 77.7. So, x would be 77.7 - 42, which is 35.7. So, she needs to get 36 correct on the second test. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total percentage. Let me recast this.

Total questions: 70 + 40 = 110.

70% of 110 is 0.70 * 110. Let me compute 111 * 0.70.

111 * 0.70: 111 * 0.7 is 77.7, and 111 * 0.0 is 0.11, so 77.7 + 0.11 is 77.8? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.70 is 70%, so 111 * 0.70 is 77.7. So, 77.7 is the exact number, which is 77.7, so she needs to get 78 correct.

But if she got 42
