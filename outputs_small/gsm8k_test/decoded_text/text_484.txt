Q: Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Stetson made a bet with Alec. Stetson is going to give Alec $10 for each orange he eats. At the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked a total of 60 oranges. I need to figure out how much money Stetson gave up. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Stetson is giving Alec money based on the number of oranges he eats. For each orange he eats, he gives Alec $10. So, the total money he gives up would be the number of oranges he ate multiplied by $10. That makes sense.

Now, they picked 60 oranges in total. Stetson ate 2/5 of those oranges. So, I need to calculate how many oranges that is. To do that, I can multiply the total number of oranges by 2/5. Let me write that down:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60

Hmm, let me compute that. 2/5 of 60. Well, 60 divided by 5 is 13.2, right? Because 5 times 13 is 65, and 5 times 13.2 is 66. So, 66 divided by 5 is 13.2. Then, multiplying that by 2 gives me 26.4. Wait, that can't be right because you can't eat a fraction of an orange. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, no, actually, 2/5 of 60 is the same as (2*60)/5. So, 2 times 60 is 120, and then divided by 5 is 24. Oh, okay, that makes more sense. So, 2/5 of 60 is 24. So, he ate 24 oranges.

Let me double-check that. 2/5 of 60. 60 divided by 5 is 12.12, so 12.12 times 2 is 24.12. Wait, that's not 24.12. Wait, no, 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4 times 60 is 24. So, that's correct. So, he ate 24 oranges.

So, each orange he ate, he gives Alec $10. So, the total money he gave up is 24 oranges times $10 per orange. Let me compute that.

24 * 10 = 240. So, he gave up $240.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of oranges he ate. So, 2/5 of 60 is 24. 2/5 of 60 is 24. So, 24 oranges. 24 times 10 is 240. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 1/5 of 60 is 12, so 2/5 is 24. Yeah, that's the same as before.

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

Wait, but let me think again. If they picked 60 oranges, and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, which is 24, so he gave up 24 times $10, which is 240. So, yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 10 times 24. 10 times 20 is 200, and 10 times 4 is 40, so 200 plus 40 is 240. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think that's the answer. $240.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of money Stetson gave up is \boxed{240}.

Stetson made a bet with Alec where he would give Alec $10 for each orange he eats. At the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked. To find the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we first calculate the number of oranges he ate.

The number of oranges eaten is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]
