Q: James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of the distance.  After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Okay, so I need to figure out how long it took James to swim across this 20-mile lake. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. That means his swimming speed is 2 mph. The total distance he needs to swim is 20 miles. But he doesn't swim the entire distance; he only swims 60% of it. Hmm, let me make sure I understand that correctly. So, 60% of 20 miles is... let me calculate that. 60% is 0.6 in decimal, so 0.6 times 20 miles. Let me do that: 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. So, he swims 12 miles initially.

Wait, hold on, 60% of 20 miles. Let me double-check that. 10% of 20 is 2.2, so 60% would be 6 times 2.2, which is 13.2. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 60% of 20 is 13.2 miles. So, he swims 13.2 miles at 2 mph. Then, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. After that, he finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. So, let's break this down.

First, swimming 60% of the distance: 13.2 miles. His swimming speed is 2 mph. So, the time taken for this part is distance divided by speed, which is 13.2 / 2. Let me compute that: 13.2 divided by 2 is 6.6 hours. So, he spends 6.6 hours swimming the first part.

Then, he rests on the island for half as long as the swimming time. So, the swimming time is 6.6 hours, so resting time is half of that, which is 3.3 hours. So, he rests for 3.3 hours.

After resting, he finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. So, let's figure out how much distance he has left after the first 13.2 miles. The total distance is 20 miles, so 20 - 13.2 = 16.8 miles. So, he has 16.8 miles left to swim.

But he swims this remaining distance at half the speed, which is 1 mph. So, the time taken for the remaining 16.8 miles is 16.8 / 1 = 16.8 hours. Wait, that seems really long. 16.8 hours is over 4 and a half days. Is that possible?

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

First, 60% of 20 miles is 12 miles, not 13.2. Wait, 60% of 20 is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles. So, that part is correct. So, swimming 12 miles at 2 mph is 12 / 2 = 6 hours. Wait, hold on, 12 divided by 2 is 6, not 6.6. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 13.2 miles. It's actually 12 miles.

So, swimming 12 miles at 2 mph is 6 hours. Then, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, swimming time is 6 hours, so resting time is 3 hours. Then, he finishes the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 1 mph. So, the remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. So, 8 miles at 1 mph is 8 hours.

So, total time is swimming time + resting time + finishing time. That is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Wait, that seems a lot, but let me verify each step.

1. Total distance: 20 miles.

2. He swims 60% of the distance: 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

3. Swimming speed: 2 mph.

4. Swimming time: 12 / 2 = 6 hours.

5. Resting time: half of swimming time, so 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

6. Remaining distance: 20 - 12 = 8 miles.

7. Finishing speed: half the original speed, so 1 mph.

8. Finishing time: 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

9. Total time
