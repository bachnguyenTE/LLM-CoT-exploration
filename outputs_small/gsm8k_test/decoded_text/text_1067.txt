Okay, so Anthony is sending out coupons for his pizza parlor, and he wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents as well. The question is asking how much he spends on postage in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many big coupons Anthony is sending out. The problem says he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small ones. He's sending out 700 small coupons, so that means the number of big coupons should be 2 times 700. Let me write that down:

Number of big coupons = 2 × 700 = 1400.

Okay, so he's sending out 1400 big coupons. Now, each small coupon costs 5 cents, and each big coupon costs 15 cents. Wait, both small and big coupons cost 15 cents? That seems a bit odd, but maybe that's how it is. So, each small and each big coupon is 15 cents. Hmm, that might be a typo or maybe it's intentional. I'll go with that for now.

So, the cost for each small coupon is 5 cents, and the cost for each big coupon is 15 cents. So, to find the total postage, I need to calculate the cost for all the small coupons and add it to the cost for all the big coupons.

Let me write that as an equation:

Total cost = (Number of small coupons × Cost per small coupon) + (Number of big coupons × Cost per big coupon)

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = (700 × 5) + (1400 × 15)

Wait, hold on, 700 is the number of small coupons, right? So, 700 × 5 cents for small coupons, and 1400 × 15 cents for big coupons.

Let me compute each part separately to avoid mistakes.

First, 700 × 5. Let me do that multiplication. 700 times 5. Well, 700 × 5 is the same as 700 × 5. 700 × 5 is 3500. So, the cost for small coupons is 3500 cents.

Next, 1400 × 15. Wait, no, the big coupons cost 15 cents each, so it's 1400 × 15. Hmm, that's a bit more involved. Let me compute that.

1400 × 15. I can break this down as 1400 × 10 + 1400 × 5. So, 1400 × 10 is 14000, and 1400 × 5 is 7000. Adding those together, 14000 + 7000 is 21000. So, the cost for big coupons is 21000 cents.

Now, adding the two costs together: 3500 cents (for small) + 21000 cents (for big) = 24500 cents.

But the question asks for the total amount spent on postage, and it's in cents. I think we need to convert that into dollars because it's more common to see amounts in dollars. So, 24500 cents divided by 100 cents per dollar is 245 dollars.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, number of big coupons: 2 × 700 = 1400. That seems right.

Cost for small coupons: 700 × 5 = 3500 cents. That's correct.

Cost for big coupons: 1400 × 15. Let me compute that again. 1400 × 15. 1400 × 10 is 1400, and 1400 × 5 is 7000. So, 1400 + 7000 is 8400. Wait, hold on, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Wait, no, 1400 × 15 is 1400 × 10 + 1400 × 5, which is 14000 + 7000, which is 21000. Wait, no, 1400 × 10 is 14000, and 1400
