Q: On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?

Okay, so I have this problem here about filling up helium balloons, and I need to figure out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that on a certain day, the total cost to fill 20 helium balloons was $900. So, if 20 balloons cost $900, I can probably find out the cost per balloon on that day. Let me write that down.

Total cost on the first day: $900
Number of balloons filled on the first day: 20

So, the cost per balloon on the first day would be total cost divided by the number of balloons, right? That would be 900 divided by 20. Let me calculate that.

900 ÷ 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 900 how many times? Well, 20 times 40 is 920, which is too much. So, 22 times 40 is 920, which is still more than 900. Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Let me do 900 ÷ 20. 20 goes into 90 four times because 22 times 4 is 88. Subtract 88 from 90, and you get 12. Bring down the 0, making it 120. 22 goes into 120 five times because 22 times 5 is 110. Subtract 111 from 12, and you get 1. So, it's 45 with a remainder of 1. Wait, that can't be right because 22 times 45 is 1100, which is way more than 900. Hmm, maybe I messed up the division.

Wait, no, 22 times 40 is 880, right? So, 22 times 40 is 880. Then, 900 minus 880 is 120. So, 22 goes into 120 how many times? 22 times 5 is 110, so 5 times. 120 minus 110 is 10. So, 40 + 5 is 45, with a remainder of 10. So, 900 ÷ 22 is 45 with a remainder of 10, which is 45.5. So, $45.50 per balloon on the first day.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay, let me check. 22 balloons times $45.50 each would be 22 times 45 is 990, plus 22 times 0.50 is 11, so total is 990 + 11 = $1001. But the total was $900. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, no, 22 times 45.50 is 22 times 45.50. Let me compute that. 22 times 45 is 990, and 22 times 0.50 is 11, so total is 990 + 11 = 1001. But the total was $900. So, that can't be right. So, my initial calculation must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I should have divided 900 by 22 instead of 20? Let me try that. 900 ÷ 22. 22 times 40 is 968, which is more than 900. 22 times 40 is 968, so 44 times 22 is 968. 900 minus 968 is 22. So, 44 + 1 is 45. So, 900 ÷ 22 is 45. So, $45.00 per balloon on the first day. Wait, that makes more sense because 22 times 45 is 990, which is close to 900, but actually, 22 times 45 is 990, which is 900 + 90. So, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I should have done 900 ÷ 22. Let me compute that. 22 times 40 is 968, which is more than 9
