Q: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and he's driving at 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving faster, at 70 miles per hour. I need to figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when two objects are moving in the same direction, the time it takes for the faster one to catch up can be found by considering the relative speed between them. So, the idea is that the distance between them is closing at a rate equal to the difference in their speeds.

Let me write down the given information:

- Bob's speed (v_bob) = 55 mph
- Tom's speed (v_tom) = 70 mph
- Initial distance between them (d_initial) = 75 miles

I think the formula for time when two objects are moving towards each other or in the same direction is:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

In this case, since Tom is behind Bob, he needs to cover the 75 miles gap. The relative speed is the difference between Tom's speed and Bob's speed because they're moving in the same direction.

So, relative speed (v_rel) = v_tom - v_bob = 70 - 55 = 15 mph

Wait, that seems low. 70 minus 55 is 15? Let me check that again. 70 minus 55 is indeed 15. Hmm, okay, so Tom is gaining on Bob at 15 miles per hour.

Now, the distance to cover is 75 miles. So, time (t) = distance / speed = 75 / 15 = 5 hours.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should set up equations for their positions as functions of time and see if that gives the same result.

Let's denote t as the time in hours it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob.

In that time, Bob will have traveled an additional distance of 55t miles, so his total distance from the starting point will be his initial position plus 55t. Similarly, Tom will have traveled 70t miles.

But wait, actually, the initial distance is 75 miles. So, if I consider the starting point of Bob as position 0, then Tom starts at position 75 miles. So, the position of Bob at time t is 0 + 55t, and the position of Tom is 75 + 70t.

We need to find the time t when their positions are equal:

55t = 75 + 70t

Let me solve this equation:

55t = 75 + 70t

Subtract 55t from both sides:

0 = 75 + 15t

Subtract 75 from both sides:

-75 = 15t

Divide both sides by 15:

t = -75 / 15 = -5

Wait, that gives a negative time, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, did I set up the equation correctly?

Let me think again. Maybe I should consider the distance between them as a function of time. Since Tom is behind, the distance between them decreases at a rate of 15 mph. So, the time it takes to cover the initial 75 miles gap is 75 / 15 = 5 hours. That matches my earlier result.

But when I set up the equations, I got a negative time, which suggests that Tom is actually moving away from Bob, which contradicts the problem statement. That must mean I set up the equation incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the distance between them as Tom's position minus Bob's position. So, if Tom is behind, his position is less than Bob's position. So, maybe the equation should be:

Tom's position = Bob's position + 75 miles

So, 70t = 55t + 75

Subtract 55t from both sides:

15t = 75

t = 75 / 15 = 5 hours

Ah, that makes sense. So, the equation should be set up as Tom's position equals Bob's position plus the initial distance. That way, we get a positive time.

So, the correct equation is:

70t = 55t + 75

Which gives t = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Wait, but let me double-check this. If Tom is driving at 70 mph and Bob at 55 mph, the relative speed is 15 mph. So, the time to
