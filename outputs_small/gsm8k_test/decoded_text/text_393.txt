Q: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Carol spends time writing, recording, and editing a song. I need to figure out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Carol spends 4 hours writing the song. That's straightforward. Then, it mentions she spends half that much time recording it. So, if she spent 4 hours writing, half of that would be... let me calculate that. Half of 4 is 2, so she spends 2 hours recording. Got that.

Next, she spends 90 minutes editing. Hmm, the units here are different from the others—she's working in hours for writing and recording, but editing is in minutes. I need to make sure all the time spent is in the same unit to calculate the percentage. So, I should convert 90 minutes into hours. Since 60 minutes make an hour, 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. Let me check that: 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 90 minutes is 1 hour plus 36 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. Yep, that seems right.

Now, I need to find the total work time. That would be the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing. So, writing is 4 hours, recording is 2 hours, and editing is 1.5 hours. Let me add those up.

4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) = 6 hours. Then, adding the editing time: 6 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours. So, her total work time is 7.5 hours.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing. So, I need to find what percentage 1.5 hours is of the total 7.5 hours.

To find a percentage, I remember the formula: (part / whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the editing time, which is 1.5 hours, and the whole is the total work time, which is 7.5 hours.

So, plugging in the numbers: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100. Let me compute that. First, 1.5 divided by 7.5. Hmm, 1.5 divided by 7.5. Let me think, 7.5 divided by 1.5 is 5, so 1.5 divided by 7.5 is 1/5, which is 0.2. So, 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So, 20% of her total work time was spent editing.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, writing is 4 hours, recording is 2 hours, editing is 1.5 hours. Total is 7.5 hours. 1.5 divided by 7.5 is indeed 0.2, which is 20%. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it in minutes to see if I get the same result. Let me try that. Writing is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes (since 4*60=240). Recording is half of that, which is 120 minutes. Editing is 90 minutes. So, total time is 240 + 120 + 90. Let's add those up: 240 + 120 is 360, plus 90 is 450 minutes. So, total time is 450 minutes.

Now, editing time is 90 minutes. So, 90 divided by 450. Let me compute that. 90 divided by 450. Hmm, both numbers are divisible by 9. 90 divided by 9 is 10, and 450 divided by 9 is 50. So, 10/50. 10 divided by 50 is approximately 0.1818. Multiply by 100, that's 18.18%. Wait, that's approximately 18.18%, which is roughly 18.2%. But earlier, I got 20%. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, hold on. Let me check the conversion again. 90 minutes is 1.5 hours, right? So, 1.5 hours is 90 minutes. So, 1.5 /7.5 is 0.2, which is 20%. But when I converted everything to minutes, I got
