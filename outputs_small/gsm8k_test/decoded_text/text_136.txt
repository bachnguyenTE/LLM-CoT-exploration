Q: There are 27 unicorns left in the world.  One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.  Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.  How many female Scottish unicorns are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about unicorns, and I need to figure out how many female unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Then, two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. The question is asking how many female unicorns are there in the Scottish Highlands. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, the total number of unicorns is 27. That seems straightforward. Now, one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, I need to find out how many unicorns that is. To do that, I can calculate one third of 27.

Let me write that down: (1/3) * 27. Hmm, 27 divided by 3 is 9. So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Got that part.

Now, of these 9 unicorns, two thirds are female. So, I need to find two thirds of 9. Let me calculate that: (2/3) * 9. Hmm, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 times 2 is 6. So, that would mean there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 9 unicorns in the Highlands, and two thirds are female, then one third would be male. So, 9 divided by 3 is 3, so 3 male and 6 female. That adds up to 9, which matches the total number of unicorns in the Highlands. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as fractions. If one third are in the Highlands, then two thirds are outside. But the question specifically asks about the Highlands, so I don't need to worry about the rest. So, 27 unicorns total, 1/3 in Highlands, 2/3 outside. Then, of the 1/3, 2/3 are female. So, 1/3 * 2/3 is 2/9 of the total unicorns are female in the Highlands.

Wait, let me see. 2/9 of 27. Hmm, 27 divided by 9 is 3, so 3 times 2 is 6. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to look at it.

So, whether I calculate it directly or use fractions, I get 6 female unicorns. That seems consistent.

Let me just visualize it. Imagine 27 unicorns. If I divide them into three equal groups, each group has 9. One group is in the Highlands, and two groups are outside. In the Highlands, two-thirds of the 9 are female. So, 2/3 of 9 is 6. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about the entire population, 27, and the proportion in the Highlands, which is 1/3, so 9. Then, within that 9, 2/3 are female. So, 2/3 of 9 is 6. So, same result.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems pretty straightforward. So, the answer should be 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

**Final Answer**
The number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is \boxed{6}.

First, we know there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. To find the number of unicorns in the Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Next, we need to determine how many of these are female. Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. We calculate this as:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is \boxed{6}.
