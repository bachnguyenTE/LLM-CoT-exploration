Q: Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. If sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200, how much money are all her jewels worth?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Hmm, let me see. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. I need to figure out how much money all her jewels are worth. Sapphires are worth $800 each, and rubies are worth $1200 each. 

First, let me break this down. Jenna initially has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for rubies. So, after the trade, how many sapphires does she have left? Well, she started with 8 and traded away 3, so that leaves her with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires. 

Now, she got 2 rubies in exchange for those 3 sapphires. So, her total jewels now consist of 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. 

Next, I need to calculate the total value of these jewels. Sapphires are worth $800 each, so 5 sapphires would be 5 multiplied by $800. Rubies are worth $1200 each, so 2 rubies would be 2 multiplied by $1200. 

Let me compute each part step by step. 

Starting with the sapphires: 5 sapphires * $800/sappire. Hmm, 5 times 800. Let me do that multiplication. 5 * 800 is 4000, right? Because 5*800 is 4000. Wait, no, 5*800 is 4000. Wait, 800 is 800 + 0, so 5*800 is 4000. Yeah, that's correct. 

Now, for the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby. That's 2 * 1200. Let me compute that. 2*1200 is 2400, and 2*0 is 0, so total is 2400. 

So, the total value is the sum of the sapphires and rubies. That would be 4000 + 2400. Let me add those together. 4000 + 2400 is 6400. 

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Starting with sapphires: 5 sapphires * $800 each. 5*800 is indeed 4000. Rubies: 2 * 1200 is 2400. Adding them together: 4000 + 2400 is 6400. Hmm, that seems correct. 

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial trade. She started with 8 sapphires, traded 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. The value is 5*800 + 2*1200. 

Wait, 5*800 is 4000, and 2*1200 is 2400. 4000 + 2400 is 6400. So, that's $6400. 

Is that the total value? It seems correct. So, the answer should be $6400. 

But let me think again. Maybe I misread the values. The problem says sapphires are worth $800 each, and rubies are worth $1200 each. So, 5 sapphires would be 5*800=4000, and 2 rubies would be 2*1200=2400. 4000+2400=6400. Yeah, that's right. 

Alternatively, maybe the trade is worth something else? But the problem doesn't mention any exchange rate for the trade, just the value of each jewel. So, I think my initial approach is correct. 

So, I think the total value is $6400. 

**Final Answer**
The total value of all her jewels is \boxed{6400} dollars.
