Q: Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mia's restaurant. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function. So, that's a total of 42 + 15 = 57 people coming. Hmm, okay, so 57 people in total.

Now, the restaurant has regular chairs and high chairs. It mentions that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Hmm, so if I let the number of high chairs be H, then the number of regular chairs would be 5H. Got it.

The problem also states that there are 8 high chairs. So, H = 8. That means the number of regular chairs is 5 times 8, which is 40. So, 44 regular chairs and 8 high chairs. Let me check that: 5 times 8 is 40, yes, that's correct.

So, total chairs in the restaurant right now would be the sum of high chairs and regular chairs. That's 8 + 44 = 52 chairs. Wait, but the total number of people is 57. So, how many more chairs does she need to get?

Hmm, so if there are 52 chairs and 57 people, then the number of chairs needed is 57. So, chairs needed minus chairs available is 57 - 52 = 5. So, she needs 5 more chairs.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, high chairs: 8, regular chairs: 5 times that is 40, so 8 + 40 = 48 chairs. Wait, hold on, 5 times 8 is 40, not 40. Wait, 5 times 8 is 40, right? So, 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so 8 + 40 is 48 chairs. Wait, 48 chairs? That doesn't make sense because 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs is 48 chairs. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? No, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? No, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? No, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48? Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 + 40 is 48. Wait, 8 +
