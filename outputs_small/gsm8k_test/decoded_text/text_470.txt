Q: Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10. What is the amount of change Theo received?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Theo received after buying a pen and a piece of paper. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Theo bought a pen for $2. That part is straightforward. So, the pen costs $2. 

Next, it mentions that the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the cost of the paper based on the pen's price. Let me write that down.

The pen costs $2, so three times that would be 3 multiplied by 2. Let me do that math: 3 * 2 = 6. So, three times the pen's price is $6.

But the paper costs $1 less than that. So, I need to subtract $1 from $6. That would be 6 - 1 = 5. So, the paper costs $5.

Now, I need to find the total amount Theo spent. That would be the cost of the pen plus the cost of the paper. So, $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 2 plus 5 is indeed 7. So, the total cost is $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. So, to find out how much change she received, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave. That would be $10 - $7.

Let me do that subtraction: 10 minus 7 is 3. So, the change she received is $3.

Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. The pen is $2, three times that is $6, minus $1 is $5 for the paper. Total is $7. She gave $10, so 10 minus 7 is 3. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the change Theo received is $3.

**Final Answer**
Theo received a change of \boxed{3} dollars.

Theo bought a pen for $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

First, calculate three times the price of the pen:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the paper:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

The total amount Theo spent is the sum of the cost of the pen and the paper:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. The change she received is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Thus, the amount of change Theo received is \boxed{3} dollars.
