Q: 44 seniors need to receive awards.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Okay, so I have this problem here about 44 seniors who need to receive awards. Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20. Then, each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds an extra 20% cost per frame. Also, 2 of the seniors will get pins that are $5 each. Additionally, 1/4 of the seniors are officers who will receive cords costing $12 each. I need to figure out how much will be spent on the senior gifts. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many picture frames there are. There are 44 seniors, and each gets a frame, so that's 44 frames. Each frame costs $20, so I can calculate the total cost for the frames by multiplying 44 by $20. Let me write that down:

Total cost for frames = 44 * $20.

Hmm, 44 times 20. Let me compute that. 44 times 20 is the same as 44 * 20. 44 * 20 is 880. So, the frames cost $880 in total.

Next, each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. Wait, 20% is the percentage, right? So, 20% of $20. Let me calculate that. 20% of 20 is 0.20 * 20. 0.20 * 20 is 4.40. So, each frame costs an extra $4.40 for the logo. Therefore, the total cost per frame now is $20 + $4.40, which is $24.40 per frame.

So, the total cost for all the frames with logos would be 44 frames multiplied by $24.40 per frame. Let me compute that. 44 * 24.40. Hmm, 44 * 24 is 105.60, and 44 * 0.40 is 17.60. So, adding those together, 105.60 + 17.60 is 113.20. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 44 * 24.40. Maybe I should break it down differently. 24.40 is the same as 24 + 0.40. So, 44 * 24 is 105.60, and 44 * 0.40 is 17.60. Adding those together: 105.60 + 17.60 is indeed 123.20. Wait, no, 105.60 + 17.60 is 123.20. Wait, 105.60 + 17.60 is 123.20. So, the total cost for the frames with logos is $123.20.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay, let me see. Each frame is $20, and 20% of that is $4.40, so each frame is $24.40. 44 frames times $24.40. Hmm, 44 * 24 is 1056, and 44 * 0.40 is 17.60, so 1056 + 17.60 is 1073.60. Wait, that's different. Wait, no, 44 * 24.40 is 44*(24 + 0.40) = 44*24 + 44*0.40. 44*24 is 1056, and 44*0.40 is 17.60. So, 1056 + 17.60 is 1073.60. So, $1073.60. Wait, that's $1073.60. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but 44 frames at $24.40 each is 44*24.40. Let me compute 44*24.40. 24.40 * 44. 24.40 * 40 is 976.00, and 24.40 * 4 is 97
