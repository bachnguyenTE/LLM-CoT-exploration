Q: Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?

Okay, so I have this problem about Sue and her neighbors playing a prank on her. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, on Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard. So, at the start of Friday, there are 18 pink flamingos. That's straightforward.

Then, on Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. Hmm, so they took back one third of the 18 pink flamingos. Let me calculate that. One third of 18 is 6, right? So, they took back 6 pink flamingos. 

But then, they painted these 6 white and put them back. So, now, on Saturday, how many pink and white flamingos are there? 

Originally, there were 18 pink. They took back 6, so now there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left. Then, they added 6 white ones, so now the total white flamingos are 6. 

So, after Saturday, the number of pink flamingos is 12, and white flamingos is 6. 

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos. So, adding 18 to the current pink flamingos. 

So, pink flamingos after Sunday morning would be 12 + 18 = 30. 

And the white flamingos remain at 6, since they were only painted white on Saturday and didn't get added again. 

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. On Saturday, they took back 6 pink, painted them white, and put them back. So, the white flamingos are 6, and the pink flamingos are 12. Then, on Sunday, they added 18 pink ones. So, pink flamingos become 12 +18=30, and white flamingos are still 6. 

So, at noon on Sunday, how many more pink are there than white? So, 30 pink minus 6 white is 24. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me go through it again.

Start: 18 pink.

Saturday morning: take back 1/3 of 18, which is 6. So, 18 -6 =12 pink left. Then, paint them white, so white becomes 6. So, pink is 12, white is 6.

Sunday morning: add 18 pink. So, 12 +18=30 pink. White remains 6. So, 30 -6=24. 

Wait, but the question is asking how many more pink are there than white. So, 24 more pink than white. So, the answer is 24.

But let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?"

So, the key points are:

- Friday: 18 pink.

- Saturday: take back 1/3, paint white, put back. So, 18 -6=12 pink, 6 white.

- Sunday: add 18 pink. So, 12 +18=30 pink, 6 white.

So, 30 -6=24. So, 24 more pink than white.

Wait, but the problem says "how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos." So, 30 -6=24. So, 24 more pink.

But let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the total number of pink and white on Sunday is 30 pink and 6 white, so 24 more pink.

Alternatively, maybe the total number of white flamingos is 6, and the total number of pink is 30, so 24 more.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the total number of each color.

Wait, but the problem says "how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos." So, it's the difference between the total pink and total white.

So, 30 pink and 6 white, so 24 more pink.

Wait, but let me think if the problem is about the number of each color on Sunday. So, on Sunday
