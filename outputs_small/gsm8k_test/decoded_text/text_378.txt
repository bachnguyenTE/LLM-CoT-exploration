A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Lindsay is trying to do the laundry, and she thinks she missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. Wait, hold on, the question says there are 50 socks. Hmm, maybe a typo? Let me check. It says, "There are 50 socks that need washing." Hmm, maybe it's 50? Or maybe 50? I need to clarify that. But since the user wrote 50, I'll go with that. So, 50 socks need washing.
