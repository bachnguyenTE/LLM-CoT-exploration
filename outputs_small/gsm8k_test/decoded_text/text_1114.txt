Q: Raymond had $21. Then he saved $11 from his allowance and spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money Raymond had initially. He started with $21.

Next, he saved an additional $111 from his allowance. Adding this to his initial amount gives $21 + $11 = $32.

Then, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. The total amount spent is $5 + $19 = $24.

Finally, to find out how much money Raymond has left, I subtract the total amount spent from the amount he had after saving: $32 - $24 = $8.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Raymond has left.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Raymond starts with **\$21**.

2. **Savings:**
   He saved **\$11** from his allowance.
   \[
   \$21 + \$111 = \$131
   \]
   Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that.

   **Correct Calculation:**
   \[
   \$21 + \$11 = \$32
   \]

3. **Spending:**
   He spent **\$5** on a comic book and **\$19** on a puzzle.
   \[
   \$5 + \$19 = \$24
   \]

4. **Money Left:**
   Subtract the total amount spent from the amount he had after saving.
   \[
   \$32 - \$24 = \$8
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
