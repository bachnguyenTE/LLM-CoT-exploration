Q: Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?

Okay, so Artie has this flower stand at the Farmers Market, and he sells three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. Each of these flowers has a different price per pot. Marigolds are $2.74 each, petunias are $1.87 each, and begonias are $2.12 each. Now, Artie doesn't have any change today, so he's decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. 

He's planning to sell 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias. The question is asking how much he'll make after rounding the prices. The options aren't given, but I need to figure it out step by step.

First, let me break down the problem. Artie is selling three different flowers, each with a different price per pot. He's rounding each price to the nearest dollar. So, I need to figure out what each of these rounded prices is, then multiply each by the number of pots he's selling, and then add them all together to get the total amount he'll make.

Let me start with the marigolds. Each pot is $2.74. Rounding to the nearest dollar, I need to look at the decimal part. $2.74 is 2 dollars and 74 cents. Since 74 cents is more than 50 cents, which is half of a dollar, we round up. So, $2.74 rounded to the nearest dollar is $3.00.

Next, petunias. Each pot is $1.87. Again, I need to round this to the nearest dollar. $1.87 is 1 dollar and 87 cents. 87 cents is more than 50 cents, so we round up as well. Therefore, $1.87 becomes $2.00.

Now, for the begonias. Each pot is $2.12. Rounding this to the nearest dollar. $2.12 is 2 dollars and 12 cents. 12 cents is less than 50 cents, so we round down. So, $2.12 becomes $2.00.

So, after rounding, the prices per pot are:
- Marigolds: $3.00
- Petunias: $2.00
- Begonias: $2.00

Now, Artie is selling 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias. I need to calculate the total for each type and then add them together.

Starting with marigolds: 12 pots at $3.00 each. So, 12 * 3.00. Let me compute that. 12 times 3 is 36. So, 12 marigolds would make $36.00.

Next, petunias: 9 pots at $2.00 each. So, 9 * 2.00. That's straightforward. 9 times 2 is 18. So, 9 petunias would make $18.00.

Then, begonias: 17 pots at $2.00 each. Hmm, 17 times 2 is 34. So, 17 begonias would make $34.00.

Now, adding all these amounts together: $36.00 (from marigolds) + $18.00 (from petunias) + $34.00 (from begonias). Let me add them step by step.

First, add $36.00 and $18.00. That's 36 + 18, which is 54. So, $54.00.

Then, add that to $34.00. So, 54 + 34 is 88. So, the total is $88.00.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Marigolds: 12 pots at $3.00 each. 12 * 3 = 36, so $36.00. That seems right.

Petunias: 9 pots at $2.00 each. 9 * 2 = 18, so $18.00. That's correct.

Begonias: 17 pots at $2.00 each. 17 * 2 = 34, so $34.00. That's correct.

Adding them up: 36 + 18
