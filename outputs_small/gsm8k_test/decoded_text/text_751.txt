Q: Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.  When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile.  The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas.  On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Gunther and his bananas, and I need to figure out how many bananas he found in the pile. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit confusing, but if I take it one day at a time, I think I can handle it.

First, the problem says Gunther had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch. So, that's the starting point. I'll write that down:

Day 0: 48 bananas.

Then, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile. Hmm, so Arnold took half, which means Gunther is left with the other half. Let me calculate that.

If there were 48 bananas, half of that is 24. So, after Arnold steals them, Gunther is left with 24 bananas. I'll note that:

After Day 1: 24 bananas.

Next day, which would be Day 2, Gunther adds another 25 bananas to his pile. So, he takes his current pile and adds 25. Let me see, he had 24, so adding 25 would make it 24 + 25. Let me do that math.

24 + 25 = 29. So, after adding 25 bananas, he has 29 bananas.

But then, later that evening, Arnold steals another 12 bananas. So, Arnold takes 12 from the 29. I need to subtract 12 from 29 to find out how many are left.

29 - 12 = 17. So, after Arnold steals them, there are 17 bananas left.

Moving on to Day 3, Gunther adds another 6 bananas to his pile. So, he takes his current pile of 17 and adds 6. Let me add those together.

17 + 6 = 23. So, after adding 6 bananas, he has 23 bananas.

Wait, hold on. The question is asking how many bananas Gunther found were in the pile. So, on the third day, he adds 6 bananas, but does that mean he's adding them to the pile, or is he just taking them out? Hmm, the wording says, "On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas." So, he adds them to his pile, which means the pile now has 23 bananas.

But wait, let me make sure. The problem says, "how many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile." So, he found them in the pile, meaning he added them to the pile. So, the pile now has 23 bananas.

But hold on, let me go through each day again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Day 0: 48 bananas.

Arnold steals half: 48 / 2 = 24. So, left with 24.

Day 1: Gunther adds 25. 24 + 25 = 29.

Arnold steals another 12: 29 - 12 = 17.

Day 2: Gunther adds 6. 17 + 6 = 23.

So, the pile now has 23 bananas. So, the answer should be 23.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can have a twist. The problem says, "how many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile." So, does that mean he found them in the pile, meaning he added them, or did he take them out? Hmm.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas." So, he added them to his pile, so the pile now has 23 bananas. So, the answer is 23.

But let me make sure. So, starting with 48, Arnold takes half, so 24 left. Then, Gunther adds 25, so 29. Arnold takes 12, so 17 left. Then, Gunther adds 6, so 23. So, the pile has 23 bananas.

Wait, but let me think about the wording again. It says, "how many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile." So, he found them in the pile, meaning he added them, so the pile now has 23 bananas. So, the answer is 23.

But hold on, let me check the problem again. It says, "how many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?" So, he found them in the pile, meaning he added them, so the pile now has
