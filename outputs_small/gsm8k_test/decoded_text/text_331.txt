Q: Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?

First, I need to calculate the net pay for both jobs by considering the respective tax rates and deductions.

For Job A:
- The annual salary is $15,0000 (which is $15,0000, but I'll assume it's $15,000 for clarity).
- The tax rate is 20%.
- The total tax is 20% of $15,000, which is $1,0000.
- The net pay is the salary minus the tax: $15,000 - $1,000 = $4,000.

For Job B:
- The annual salary is $42,000.
- The property tax is $6,000.
- The tax rate on net income after property tax is 10%.
- First, subtract the property tax from the salary: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- Then, apply the tax rate to the net income: 10% of $36,000 is $3,600.
- The net pay is the net income minus the tax: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the net pays, Job B provides a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $4,000.

To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we'll calculate the net pay for both jobs by considering the respective tax rates and deductions.

### **Job A:**
- **Annual Salary:** \$15,000
- **Tax Rate:** 20%
- **Total Tax:** 20% of \$15,000 = \$3,000
- **Net Pay:** \$15,000 - \$3,000 = **\$12,000**

### **Job B:**
- **Annual Salary:** \$42,000
- **Property Tax:** \$6,000
- **Tax Rate on Net Income:** 10%
- **Net Income Before Tax:** \$42,000 - \$6,000 = **\$36,000**
- **Tax on Net Income:** 10% of \$36,000 = **\$3,600**
- **Net Pay:** \$36,000 - \$3,600 = **\$32,400**

### **Comparison:**
- **Job A Net Pay:** \$12,000
- **Job B Net Pay:** \$32,400

**Conclusion:**  
Job B provides a higher net pay of **\$32,400** compared to Job A's **\$12,000**.

\boxed{32400}
