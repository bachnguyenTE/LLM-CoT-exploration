Q: A plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles?

Okay, so I have this problem here: A plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find the plane's speed. Speed is generally calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. So, in this case, the plane went 1200 miles in 3 hours. Let me write that down:

Speed = Distance / Time

So, plugging in the numbers:

Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours

Let me do that division. 1200 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 12 four times, so 4. Then, 3 goes into 0 zero times, so 0. Then, 3 goes into 0 zero times again. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, 3 times 400 is 1200, right? Because 3 times 400 is 1200. So, 1200 divided by 3 is 400. So, the plane's speed is 400 miles per hour. Let me write that down:

Speed = 400 mph

Okay, so the plane is traveling at 400 miles per hour. Now, the question is asking, at the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles. So, we need to find the time it takes to travel 2000 miles at 400 mph.

Again, time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the formula is:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, plugging in the numbers:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 mph

Let me compute that. 2000 divided by 400. Hmm, let me see. Maybe I can simplify this fraction.

First, let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by a common factor. Let's see, 2000 and 400. Both are divisible by 100, I think. Let me check:

2000 divided by 100 is 20, and 400 divided by 100 is 4. So, that simplifies the fraction to 20/4, which is 5. So, 2000 divided by 400 is 5. Wait, but that's 2000 divided by 400, which is 5. But wait, in our case, it's 2000 divided by 400, which is the same as 2000 divided by 400, which is 5. So, that would mean the time is 5 hours.

Wait, but hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my math.

So, 400 mph is the speed. So, 400 miles per hour. So, how many hours does it take to go 2000 miles?

So, 2000 divided by 400. Let me do this division step by step.

400 goes into 2000 how many times?

Well, 400 times 5 is 2000. Because 400 times 5 is 2000. So, 400 multiplied by 5 is 2000. So, 2000 divided by 400 is 5. So, that's correct.

So, the time required is 5 hours.

Wait, but the question is asking for the additional hours needed to travel an additional 2000 miles. So, if the plane is already traveling for 3 hours, and it's going to take 5 hours in total to go 2000 miles, then the additional time would be 5 hours minus the initial 3 hours.

So, 5 hours total minus 3 hours already traveled is 2 hours. So, the additional time needed is 2 hours.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says, "how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles." So, the plane is already traveling for 3 hours, and now it's going to go an extra 2000 miles. So, the total distance becomes 1200 + 2000 = 3200 miles. But wait, no, hold on. Wait, the plane is already traveling 1200 miles in 3 hours, and now it's going to travel
