Q: At Ashley's school, they start a reforestation campaign where each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students and 3 teachers per class. How many trees will they have planted at the end of the campaign?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ashley's school reforestation campaign. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students and 3 teachers. I need to find out how many trees they'll plant in total.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to find out how many students there are in total and how many teachers there are in total. Then, I can calculate how many trees each group will plant and add them together.

Starting with the students: there are 40 classes, each with an average of 25 students. So, to find the total number of students, I should multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class. That would be 40 times 25. Let me write that down:

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class

Hmm, 40 times 25. I know that 40 times 2 is 80, so 40 times 25 is 200. So, there are 200 students in total.

Now, moving on to the teachers. Each class has an average of 3 teachers, so the total number of teachers would be 40 classes multiplied by 3 teachers per class. Let me calculate that:

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class

40 times 3 is 120. So, there are 120 teachers in total.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 40 classes times 3 teachers each. 40 times 3 is 120. Yeah, that's correct. So, 120 teachers.

Now, each student plants one tree, so the total number of trees planted by students would be equal to the total number of students. So, that's 200 trees.

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers would be 2 times the number of teachers. Let me compute that:

Total trees by teachers = 2 trees/teacher * 120 teachers

2 times 120 is 240. So, 240 trees.

Now, to find the total number of trees planted, I need to add the trees planted by students and the trees planted by teachers. So, that would be 200 trees + 240 trees.

200 plus 240 is 440. So, altogether, they will plant 440 trees.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 40 classes, 25 students each: 40*25. Let me do that again. 40*25 is 1000? Wait, no, that can't be right because 40*25 is 1000? Wait, no, 40*25 is 200, so 40*25 is 1000? Wait, no, 25 is 20 + 3, so 40*20 is 800, and 40*3 is 120, so 800 + 120 is 920. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, 40*25: 25 is a quarter of 100, so 40*25 is 100*40 divided by 4, which is 100*10, which is 1000? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 25*40 is 100, so 25*40*10 is 100*10, which is 1100? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 25*40: 25*40 is the same as 25*4*10, which is 100*10, which is 1100. Wait, no, 25*40 is 1000? Wait, no, 25*40 is 1000? Wait, 25*40: 25*4 is 100, so 25*40 is 100*10, which is 1100. Wait, that can't be right because 25*40 is 1000. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should just do 25*
