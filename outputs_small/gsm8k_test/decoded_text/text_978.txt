Q: The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100. How much do both cars cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the price of the red car. The problem states that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which costs $100.

To find the discount amount, I'll calculate 40% of $100:
40% of $100 = 0.40 × 100 = $40.

Next, I'll subtract the discount from the original price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
$100 - $40 = $56.

Finally, I'll add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $56 (red car) = $156.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total cost of both cars step by step.

1. **Price of the Blue Car:**
   
   The blue car costs \$100.

2. **Price of the Red Car:**
   
   The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the discount amount:
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 40\% \times \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40
   \]
   
   Therefore, the price of the red car is:
   
   \[
   \$100 - \$40 = \$56
   \]

3. **Total Cost of Both Cars:**
   
   \[
   \$100 (\text{blue car}) + \$56 (\text{red car}) = \$156
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{156}
\]
