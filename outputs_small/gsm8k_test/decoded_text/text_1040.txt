Q: On Monday the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. How many letters did the post office deliver Monday - Wednesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about the post office delivering letters over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I need to figure out how many letters they delivered from Monday to Wednesday. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that on Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. That seems straightforward. So, Monday's delivery is 425 letters.

Next, it mentions that on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. Hmm, okay. So, I need to calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries and then add 17 to that. Let me write that down.

One-fifth of Monday's letters is (1/5) * 425. Let me compute that. 425 divided by 5. Well, 400 divided by 5 is 80, and 25 divided by 5 is 5, so 80 + 5 is 85. So, one-fifth of 425 is 85. Then, adding 17 more, so 85 + 17. Let me do that: 85 + 10 is 96, and 7 more is 103. So, Tuesday's delivery is 103 letters.

Wait, let me double-check that. One-fifth of 425 is 85, right? 5 times 85 is 425. Then, adding 17 gives 103. Yeah, that seems correct.

Okay, moving on Wednesday. It says they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. So, first, I need to find twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries, and then add 5 to that.

Twice Tuesday's letters is 2 * 103. Let me compute that: 2 * 100 is 200, and 2 *3 is 6, so 200 +6 is 206. Then, adding 5 more, so 206 +5 is 211. So, Wednesday's delivery is 211 letters.

Wait, let me verify that. Twice Tuesday's letters: 2 *103. 100*2 is 200, 3*2 is 6, so 200 +6 is 206. Then, adding 5: 206 +5 is 211. Yep, that's correct.

So, now, I need to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday. That means adding up Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's deliveries.

Monday: 425

Tuesday: 103

Wednesday: 211

So, adding them together: 425 + 103 + 211.

Let me compute this step by step. First, 425 + 103. 425 + 100 is 525, and then +3 is 528. So, 425 +103 is 528.

Then, adding Wednesday's 211 to that. So, 528 + 211. Let me add 528 + 200 first, which is 728, and then add 11 more, so 728 +11 is 729.

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 729.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any addition errors. 425 +103: 425 +100 is 525, plus 3 is 528. Then, 528 +211: 528 +200 is 548, plus 11 is 559. Wait, hold on, that doesn't match. Wait, 528 +211 is 528 +200 is 728, plus 11 is 729. Wait, but earlier I thought 528 +211 is 559, which is wrong. So, actually, 528 +211 is 729. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me do it another way. 528 +211. Let's add the units place: 8 +1 is 9. Tens place: 2 +1 is 3. Hundreds place:5 +2 is 7. So, 729. Yes, that's correct.

So, the total is 729 letters delivered from Monday
