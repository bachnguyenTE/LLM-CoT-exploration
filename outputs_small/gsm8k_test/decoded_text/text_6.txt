Q: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about sheep in three different places: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. The question is asking how many sheep they have together, and it gives me that Seattle has 20 sheep. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if I can figure out how many sheep Charleston has, I can easily find out how many Toulouse has. Then, since I know how many each of them has, I can add them all together to get the total.

Alright, let's break it down. It mentions that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, if I let the number of sheep in Charleston be some variable, say C, then Toulouse would have 2 times C, right? So, T = 2C.

Next, it says Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Hmm, okay, so if Seattle has S sheep, then Charleston has 4 times S. Since we know Seattle has 20 sheep, that means Charleston has 4 * 20. Let me calculate that. 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80. Wait, 20 times 4 is 80? Wait, 20 is 20, so 20 times 4 is 80? Wait, no, 20 times 4 is 80? Wait, 20 times 4 is 80? Wait, 20 is 20, so 20 times 4 is 80. Yeah, that's right. So, Charleston has 80 sheep.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure. If Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many as Seattle, and Seattle has 20, then:

First, find Charleston: 4 * 20 = 80. Then, Toulouse is twice that, so 2 * 80 = 160. So, Toulouse has 160, Charleston has 80, and Seattle has 20.

So, to find the total number of sheep, I just add them up: 160 + 80 +20. Let me do that. 160 plus 80 is 240, and 240 plus 20 is 260. So, together, they have 260 sheep.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because 160 + 80 is 240, and 240 +20 is 260. Yeah, that seems right. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step.

So, starting from the bottom: Seattle has 20. Charleston has 4 times that, so 4*20=80. Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, so 2*80=160. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought Toulouse was 160, but 2*80 is 160. So, 160 +80 +20. Wait, 160 +80 is 240, plus 20 is 260. So, same result.

Wait, but hold on, earlier I thought Toulouse was 160, but now I'm thinking 160. Wait, no, 2*80 is 160, right? 80*2 is 160. So, 160 +80 is 240, plus 20 is 260. So, 260 total.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't confuse the numbers. So, if T is twice as many as C, and C is four times as many as S, and S is 20. So, C is 4*20=80, T is 2*80=160. So, 160+80+20=260. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, 160 +80 is
