Q: John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much John's research cost was. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

John starts with $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. Then, his research ends up taking 10 times that long. Hmm, wait, 10 times the initial funding? Or 10 times the initial time? The wording says "10 times that long." So, if the initial funding was 5 months, then 10 times that would be 50 months? Wait, 10 times 5 is 50? That seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, actually, let me parse that again. It says, "his research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month." So, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then, the research took 10 times that long. So, if the initial time was 5 months, then 10 times that would be 50 months? That seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread. It says, "his research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month." So, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then, the total research time is 10 times that, so 50 months. So, the first 5 months are $100,000, and then from month 6 to month 50, which is 45 months, each month's funding is 50% more than the previous month.

Wait, so the first 5 months: $100,000.

Then, starting from month 6, each subsequent month's funding is 50% more than the previous month. So, the funding increases by 50% each month after the first 5 months.

So, the total cost is the initial $100,000 plus the sum of the funding from month 6 to month 50.

So, I need to calculate the total funding from month 6 to month 50, each month being 50% more than the previous.

This sounds like a geometric series. The first term after the initial 5 months is month 6, which is 100,000 * 1.5, then month 7 is 100,000 * (1.5)^2, and so on, up to month 50, which is 100,000 * (1.5)^45.

So, the total cost is 100,000 + 100,000*(1.5 + 1.5^2 + ... +1.5^45).

So, the sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with first term a = 1.5, common ratio r = 1.5, and number of terms n = 45.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).

So, plugging in the numbers: S = 1.5*(1.5^45 - 1)/(1.5 - 1) = 1.5*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 = 3*(1.5^45 -1).

So, the total cost is 100,000 + 100,000*3*(1.5^45 -1).

Wait, hold on, that seems like a huge number. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, the initial funding is $100,000, and then the additional funding is 100,000*(1.5 + 1.5^2 + ... +1.5^45). So, the total cost is 100,000 + 100,000*(sum from k=1 to 45 of 1.5^k).

So, the sum is 1.5*(1.5^45 -1)/(1.5 -1) = 1.5*(1.5^45 -1)/0.5 = 3*(1.5^45 -1).

So, the total cost is 100,000 + 100,000*3*(1.5^45 -1).

Wait, that would be 100,000 +
