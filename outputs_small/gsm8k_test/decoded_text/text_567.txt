Q: The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost.  And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?

Okay, so I have this problem about Sharon and the tooth fairy. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy gives Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she gives her $1.00 each. After that, for the last two teeth, she gives half the amount she gave for each of the previous three teeth. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

Let me list out the events:

1. First tooth: $5.00
2. Next three teeth: $1.00 each
3. Last two teeth: half the amount of the previous three teeth, which was $1.00 each. So, half of $1.00 is $0.50 each.

Wait, so for each of the last two teeth, she gives half the amount she gave for each of the previous three teeth. So, the first three teeth after the first one are $1.00 each, so the last two teeth would be half of that, which is $0.50 each.

Let me write this down:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: 3 * $1.00
- Last two teeth: 2 * ($1.00 / 2) = 2 * $0.50

So, let me calculate each part separately.

First, the first tooth is straightforward: $5.00.

Next, the three teeth after that: 3 * $1.00. Let me compute that. 3 * 1.00 is 3.00. So, $3.00.

Then, the last two teeth: each tooth is half of $1.00, which is $0.50. So, 2 * 0.50 is 1.00. So, $1.00.

Now, let me add all these amounts together to find the total money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

So, first tooth: 5.00

Next three teeth: 3.00

Last two teeth: 1.00

Total: 5.00 + 3.00 +1.00 = 9.00

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky with the wording.

The problem says: "the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.000 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost." So, that's 3 * $1.00, which is $3.00.

Then, "for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth." So, the amount per tooth for the first three was $1.00, so half of that is $0.500 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

So, adding all together: 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the last part. It says "half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth." So, the amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00, so half of that is $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * 0.50 = 1.00. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as the amount per tooth for the last two teeth is half of the amount per tooth for the first three teeth, which was $1.00, so half is $0.50. So, each of the last two teeth is $0.50, so 2 * 0.50 = 1.00.

So, adding all together: 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00.

So, the total amount the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the first tooth $5.00, then the next three teeth $1.00 each, so 3 * 1.00 = 3.00, and the last two teeth are half of 1.00, so 0.50 each, so 2 * 0.50 = 1.00. So, 5 + 3 + 1 is 9. So, $9.00.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total as the
