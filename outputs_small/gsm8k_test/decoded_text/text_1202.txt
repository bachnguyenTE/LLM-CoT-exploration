Q: Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Amy and her eyeshadow palettes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can handle it.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

"Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?"

Alright, so Amy starts with two palettes, each containing four colors. Then she has three makeup sets, each with six colors. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so now Amy only has one palette left. Then Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. We need to find out how many eyeshadow colors she has left in total.

Let me break this down into parts.

First, let's figure out how many eyeshadow colors Amy had initially before her sister stole the palette.

She has two palettes, each with four colors. So, that's 2 palettes multiplied by 4 colors each. Let me write that down:

2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

Then, she has three makeup sets, each with six colors. So, that's 3 sets multiplied by 6 colors each. Let me calculate that:

3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

So, before her sister stole the palette, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors in total.

Wait, hold on, 2 palettes with 4 colors each is 8, and 3 makeup sets with 6 each is 18, so 8 +18 is 26. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, her sister steals one of the palettes. So, Amy loses one palette. Each palette has 4 colors, so stealing one palette means she loses 4 colors.

So, subtracting that from the total, Amy now has 26 -4 = 22 colors left.

But wait, hold on. The problem says Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. So, does that mean she uses half of the colors from one of the makeup sets, or does it mean she uses half of the colors from the entire set?

Wait, the problem says: "Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set." So, it's half of the colors in one makeup set. So, each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 3 colors.

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from one makeup set. So, that would subtract 3 from the total.

But wait, hold on. So, initially, she had 26 colors. After losing a palette, she had 22 colors. Then, she uses up half of one makeup set, which is 3 colors. So, subtracting 3 more, so 22 -3 = 19 colors left.

Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me make sure.

Wait, so the initial total is 26. After losing a palette, which had 4 colors, she has 22 left. Then, she uses half of one makeup set, which is 6 colors, so half is 3. So, she uses 3, so 22 -3 =19.

But wait, is the 3 colors from the makeup set part of the total, or is it separate?

Wait, the problem says Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. So, that is 3 colors, which are part of the total 26 colors. So, the total number of colors is 26, and then she uses 3, so 26 -3 =23? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial total is 26. Then, her sister steals one palette, which is 4 colors, so 26 -4 =22. Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. So, the 22 includes the 6 colors from the makeup set. So, if she uses half of the colors from one makeup set, that is 3 colors, so 22 -3 =19.

Alternatively, if the 22 is the total, and she uses half of the 6 colors, which is 3, so 22 -3 =19.

Alternatively, maybe the 22 is the total, and she uses half of the 22, but that would be 11, which is not half of the colors from the makeup set.

Wait, the problem says: "
