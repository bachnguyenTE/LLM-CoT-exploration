A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are initially 10 infected people. Each day, every one of these infected people infects six more people. So, every day, the number of new infections is six times the current number of infected people. But wait, does that mean the total number of infected people increases by six each day, or does it mean each person infects six others, so the total number of new infections each day is six times the current number?

I think it's the latter. So, if there are N infected people on a given day, each one infects six others, so the number of new infections that day would be 6*N. Therefore, the total number of infected people the next day would be N + 6*N, which is 7*N. So, it's a multiplicative growth each day.

Let me write that down:

Day 0 (initial): 10 infected people.

Day 1: Each of the 10 infects 6, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected: 10 + 60 =70.

Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. 10 people each infecting 6, so 10*6=60, so 10+60=70? Wait, no, 10*6 is 60, so 10+60=70? Wait, 10+60 is 70? Wait, 10+60 is 70? Wait, 10+60 is 70?
