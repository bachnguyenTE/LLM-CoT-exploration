Q: Bobby takes a 30 min lunch and 2 15 minutes break per day at the office.  After 5 days, how many hours do his lunches and breaks add up to?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

He takes a 30-minute lunch and a 2 and a half-minute break each day. Adding these together gives 32.5 minutes per day.

Next, I'll determine the total time over 5 days by multiplying the daily time by 5. That results in 162.5 minutes.

Finally, to convert the total minutes into hours, I'll divide 162.5 by 60, which equals 1.04166667 hours.

To determine the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent on lunch and breaks:**
   
   - **Lunch:** 30 minutes
   - **Break:** 2.5 minutes
   
   Total daily time = 30 minutes + 2.5 minutes = **32.5 minutes**

2. **Calculate the total time over 5 days:**
   
   Total time over 5 days = 32.5 minutes/day × 5 days = **162.5 minutes**

3. **Convert the total minutes into hours:**
   
   \[
   162.5 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1.04166667 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately **1.04 hours**.

\[
\boxed{1.04\ \text{hours}}
\]
