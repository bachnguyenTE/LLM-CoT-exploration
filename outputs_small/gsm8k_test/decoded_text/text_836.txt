Q: Jada, Rory, and Kora make clay dishes to present as art for their school project. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, while Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. If Kora made 20 dishes, how many clay dishes they all make together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jada, Rory, and Kora making clay dishes for their school project. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Hmm, so if I let Rory's number be something, maybe I can express Jada's in terms of Rory's. Then, it also mentions that Rory makes 200 more clay dishes than Kora. And we're told that Kora made 20 dishes. So, Kora's number is given as 20. 

Wait, hold on, 20? That seems like a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be 20? Or is it 20? Hmm, 20 is 20, which is twenty. But 200 is 200, which is 200. Hmm, but 200 is a lot more. Maybe it's 20? Let me check the original problem again. It says, "Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora." So, yeah, 20. So, Kora made 20 dishes, which is 20, which is 20. So, Kora made 20 dishes. 

Wait, 20 is 20? That seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's 20? Because 20 is 20, which is 20, but 20 is 20. Wait, no, 20 is 20, which is 20. Wait, no, 20 is 20, 21 is 21, 22 is 22, 23 is 23, etc. So, 20 is 20, 21 is 21, 22 is 22, 23 is 23, and so on. So, 20 is 20, which is 20. So, Kora made 20 dishes, which is 20 dishes. So, Kora made 20 dishes. 

So, Kora made 20 dishes. Then, Rory made 20 more than Kora. So, that would be 20 + 20, which is 40. So, Rory made 40 dishes. 

Then, Jada makes twice as many as Rory. So, Jada made twice as many as Rory, who made 40. So, twice 40 is 80. So, Jada made 80 dishes. 

So, now, we have Kora: 20, Rory: 40, Jada: 80. So, to find the total number of dishes they all make together, we add them up. So, 20 + 40 is 60, and 60 +80 is 140. So, together, they made 140 dishes. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Kora:20, Rory:40, Jada:80. 20+40 is 60, 60+80 is 140? Wait, no, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, no, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 144? Wait, no, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, no, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 140? Wait, 60+80 is 144? Wait, no, 60+80 is 144? Wait, 60+80 is 144? Wait, 60+80 is 144? Wait, 60+80 is 140, and then 140+8 is 148? Wait, no, 60+80 is 1
