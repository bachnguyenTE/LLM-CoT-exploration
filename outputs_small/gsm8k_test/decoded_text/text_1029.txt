Q: As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Okay, so Sally was walking to school and she had some balloons. Let me try to figure out how many balloons she ended up carrying into school. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, she had 25 red balloons, 7 green, and 12 yellow. So, initially, that's 25 + 7 + 12. Let me add those up. 25 plus 7 is 32, and 32 plus 12 is 44. So, she started with 44 balloons.

Then, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. Wait, 40%? That seems like a typo. Probably meant 40%, which is 00%. Let me confirm. 40% of 25. So, 40% is 0.4 in decimal. So, 0.4 times 25 is... 10. So, 10 red balloons burst. So, she had 25 - 10, which is 15 red balloons left.

Next, she was scared and released half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she lost 6 yellow ones. So, 12 -6 is 6 yellow balloons remaining.

Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree. So, she added 8 blue ones to her clutch. So, her current count is 15 red, 6 yellow, 8 blue. Let me add those up: 15 +6 is 21, plus 8 is 29. So, she has 29 balloons before she adds the 75% of them.

Wait, no, hold on. She found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her clutch. So, she had 8 blue, and then she added 75% of 8. So, 75% of 8 is... 0.75 times 8 is 6. So, she adds 6 more balloons. So, her total is 29 +6 is 35.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, she had 15 red, 6 yellow, 8 blue. So, 15 +6 is 21, plus 8 is 29. Then, she adds 75% of 8, which is 6. So, 29 +6 is 35. So, 35 balloons in total.

Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you add and subtract, it's easy to make a mistake.

Starting with 25 red, 7 green, 12 yellow. So, 25 +7 +12 is 44. Then, 40% of red balloons burst. 40% of 25 is 10, so 25 -10 is 15 red left. Then, 40% of 12 is 4.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a balloon, maybe it's 4 or 5? Wait, the problem says 40% of the red balloons burst. So, 40% of 25 is 10, so 10 red balloons burst. So, 15 red left. Then, 40% of yellow balloons, which is 12, so 4.8, but since we can't have 0.8, maybe it's 4 or 5? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether it's rounded or not. Hmm, but 40% of 12 is 4.8, which is 4 and 4/5. So, maybe it's 4 or 5. But since it's a math problem, maybe it's 4.8, so 4.8 is 48/10, which is 4.8. So, 12 -4.8 is 7.2. But that's not a whole number. Hmm, so maybe the problem is expecting us to use exact fractions.

Wait, 40% is 40%, which is 0.4. So, 0.4 times 12 is 4.8. So, 12 -4.8 is 7.2. So, 7.2 yellow balloons left. But that's not a whole number. Hmm, so maybe the problem is expecting us to use 40% as 40, which is 40/100, so 40% is 40/100, which is 0.4. So, 12 -4.8 is 7.2.
