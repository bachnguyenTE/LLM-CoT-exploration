Q: Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Okay, so I have this problem where Lorraine is trading stickers for buttons, and I need to figure out how many buttons she has by the end. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the information given:

- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
- A small sticker is worth one small button.
- A large button is worth three small stickers.
- Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
- She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- She trades the rest of them for small buttons.
- We need to find the total number of buttons she has by the end.

Alright, let's start by understanding the value of each sticker and button. It might help to convert everything into the same unit, like small stickers, to make the calculations easier.

First, let's note the conversion rates:

1. Large sticker = 1 large button or 3 small stickers.
2. Small sticker =1 small button.
3. Large button =3 small stickers.

So, each large sticker is equivalent to either 1 large button or 3 small stickers. Similarly, each small sticker is just 1 small button.

Now, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Let me write that down:

- Small stickers: 30
- Large stickers: 40

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, let's calculate how many small stickers she trades.

90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30. Let me compute that:

0.9 * 30 = 27.

So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 large buttons in exchange.

Wait, hold on. Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so when she trades a small sticker for a large button, she gets 3 small stickers in exchange for 1 large button. So, actually, each small sticker is equivalent to 3 small stickers, but in terms of buttons, a small sticker is 1 small button, and a large sticker is 3 small stickers.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the value of the stickers in terms of buttons.

Let me try to figure out the value of each sticker in terms of buttons.

- A large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small stickers. So, in terms of buttons, a large sticker is 1 large button, which is equal to 3 small stickers. So, 1 large sticker = 3 small stickers = 3 small buttons.

- A small sticker is worth 1 small button.

- A large button is worth 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons.

So, in terms of buttons, each sticker is worth:

- Large sticker: 3 small buttons
- Small sticker: 1 small button
- Large button: 3 small buttons

Wait, so a large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, a small sticker is worth 1 small button, and a large button is also worth 3 small buttons.

So, when she trades a small sticker for a large button, she gets 3 small stickers in exchange for 1 large button. So, in terms of buttons, she's getting 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons, but the large button is worth 3 small stickers as well. So, actually, trading a small sticker for a large button doesn't change the number of buttons she gets, because both are worth 3 small stickers.

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again.

If she trades a small sticker for a large button, she gets 1 large button, which is worth 3 small stickers. So, in terms of buttons, she's getting 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons. So, actually, the trade is 1 large sticker for 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons. So, in terms of buttons, she's getting 3 small buttons.

Wait, but a small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 1 small sticker is 1 small button, and 1 large sticker is 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons.

So, when she trades a small sticker for a large button, she gets 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons. So, the trade is 1 large sticker for 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons.

Similarly, when she trades a large sticker for large buttons, she gets 3 small stickers, which is 3 small buttons. So, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.

Wait, so both large stickers and large buttons are worth 3 small buttons. So,
