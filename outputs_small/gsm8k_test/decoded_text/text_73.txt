Q: Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150, and she's paying them for over a 3-month period with a 2% interest charge. I need to figure out how much she'll pay each month. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without any interest. Each phone is $150, so five of them would be 5 multiplied by 150. Let me write that out: 5 * 150. Hmm, 5 times 100 is 500, and 5 times 50 is 250, so adding those together gives 500 + 250 = 800. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it more carefully. 150 times 5: 100*5 is 500, 50*5 is 250, so 500 + 250 is 800. Yeah, that's correct. So the total cost is $880.

Now, she's getting these five phones for a 3-month installment. So, she's paying them over three months. But there's a 2% interest charge per unit. Hmm, does that mean 2% interest on each phone or on the total amount? The question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, I think it's 2% interest on each phone. So, for each phone, the interest would be 2% of $150.

Let me calculate that. 2% of 150 is 0.02 * 150. 0.02 * 150 is 3. So, 2% of 150 is 3. So, for each phone, the interest is $3. Since she has five phones, the total interest would be 5 * 3 = $15.

So, the total amount she needs to pay is the total cost plus the interest. That would be 880 + 15 = $895.

Now, she's paying this over three months. So, to find out how much she'll pay each month, I need to divide the total amount by 3. So, 895 divided by 3. Let me do that division.

3 goes into 8 two times (3*2=6), remainder 2. Bring down the 9 to make 29. 3 goes into 29 nine times (3*9=27), remainder 2. Bring down the 5 to make 25. 3 goes into 25 eight times (3*8=24), remainder 1. So, putting it all together, 895 divided by 3 is 298 with a remainder of 1, which is 298.333... So, approximately $298.33 per month.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with interest, it's easy to make a mistake. So, total cost is 5 phones at $150 each, which is 5*150=880. 2% of 150 is 3, so 5 phones would have 5*3=15 in interest. So, total amount is 880+15=895. Divided by 3 months is 895/3=298.333... So, yeah, that seems right.

But wait, another way to think about it is that the interest is per unit, so maybe it's compounded monthly? But the question doesn't specify compounding, so I think it's simple interest. So, 2% per unit, so 2% on each phone, so 2% of 150 is 3 per phone, so 15 total interest. So, total amount is 895, divided by 3 is 298.33 per month.

But let me think again: is the interest per unit or per total? The question says "a 2% interest will be charged for each unit." So, each phone, so 2% per phone. So, 2% of 150 is 3 per phone, so 5 phones would have 15 in total interest. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if it were 2% on the total amount, it would be 2% of 880, which is 17.60, so total amount would be 880 +17.60=897.60, and then divided by 3 is
