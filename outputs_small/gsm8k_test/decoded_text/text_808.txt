Q: There are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea and 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea. How many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a party where some tea is left, and I need to figure out how many gallons were at the beginning. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says there are 10 quarts of tea left from the party. Hmm, wait, is that 10 quarts or 10 quarts? I think it's 10 quarts, which is a typo, probably meant 10 quarts. Yeah, that makes more sense. So, 10 quarts are left.

Then, it mentions four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. Okay, so each of those four students had 1.5 quarts. I need to calculate how much tea those four students drank in total. So, 4 students times 1.5 quarts each. Let me write that down:

4 * 1.5 = ?

Hmm, 4 times 1 is 4, and 4 times 0.5 is 2, so 4 + 2 = 6 quarts. So, the four students drank a total of 6 quarts.

Next, it says 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, 16 students times 2 quarts each. Let me calculate that:

16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

So, those 16 students drank 32 quarts in total.

Now, to find out how much tea was consumed in total during the party, I need to add the tea consumed by the four students and the 16 students. So, 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Wait, hold on, the problem says there are 10 quarts left. So, if 38 quarts were consumed, then the total amount at the beginning would be the consumed amount plus the remaining amount. So, 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts.

But the question is asking for the number of gallons. I know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So, to convert quarts to gallons, I need to divide the total quarts by 4.

So, 48 quarts divided by 4 quarts per gallon is 12 gallons.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, four students: 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. That seems right.

Then, 16 students: 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. Wait, hold on, 16*2 is 32? No, 16*2 is 32? Wait, 16*2 is 32? No, 16*2 is 32? Wait, no, 16*2 is 32? Wait, 16*2 is 32? Wait, no, 16*2 is 32? Wait, 16*2 is 32? Wait, no, 16*2 is 32? Wait, 16*2 is 32? Wait, 16*2 is 32. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 6 + 32 is 38 quarts consumed. 38 quarts plus 10 quarts left is 48 quarts total. 48 quarts divided by 4 quarts per gallon is 12 gallons. Wait, hold on, 48 divided by 4 is 12? Wait, 4*12 is 48. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, hold on, 48 quarts divided by 4 is 12 gallons. So, the total amount at the beginning was 12 gallons.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. The problem says 10 quarts left, and 38 quarts consumed. So, 38 +10 is 48 quarts. 48 divided by 4 is 12 gallons. So, 12 gallons? Wait, no, 48 divided by 4 is 12. So, 12 gallons.

Wait, but let me check the problem again. It says, "There are 10 quarts of tea left from the party." So, 10 quarts left. Then, four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so 4*1.5=6 quarts. Then, 16 students each drank 2 quarts, so 16*2=32 quarts. So, total consumed is 6+32=38 quarts. So, total tea at
