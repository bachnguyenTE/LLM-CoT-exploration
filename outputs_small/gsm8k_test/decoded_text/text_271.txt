Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his houses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says John has 2 houses, each with 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, and there are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to the bedrooms. I need to find the total number of windows between the houses.

Alright, let me break this down. First, there are two houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms. So, for one house, that's 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of windows connected to the bedrooms would be 3 bedrooms multiplied by 2 windows per bedroom. Let me write that down:

Number of windows per house (connected to bedrooms) = 3 bedrooms × 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.

Wait, so each house has 6 windows connected to the bedrooms. But the problem also mentions that there are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to the bedrooms. So, I need to add those 4 windows to the 6 windows we just calculated.

Total windows per house = 6 windows (connected to bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 10 windows per house.

Since there are two houses, I need to multiply this total by 2 to get the overall total number of windows between the houses.

Total windows between the houses = 10 windows/house × 2 houses = 20 windows.

Wait, let me double-check that. Each house has 3 bedrooms, each with 2 windows, so 3×2=6. Then, each house has 4 more windows not connected to bedrooms, so 6+4=10 windows per house. Two houses, so 10×2=20 windows in total. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. Each house is treated separately, so adding them together makes sense. I don't think there are any other components mentioned in the problem, so I think 20 is the correct total number of windows between the houses.

**Final Answer**
The total number of windows between the houses is \boxed{20}.

John has 2 houses, each with 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, and there are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. 

First, calculate the number of windows connected to the bedrooms in one house:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Add the additional windows not connected to the bedrooms:
\[ 6 \text{ windows} + 4 \text{ windows} = 10 \text{ windows per house} \]

Since there are 2 houses, multiply the total windows per house by 2:
\[ 10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

The total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\).
