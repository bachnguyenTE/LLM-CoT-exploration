Q: Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Chatty has three dozen eggs, and she wants to give the same number of eggs to each of her four children. Hmm, let me figure out how to solve this. First, I need to understand what a dozen means. I think a dozen is 12 eggs. So, three dozen would be 3 times 12. Let me write that down: 3 × 12. That should give me the total number of eggs.

Calculating that, 3 × 12 is 36. Wait, no, that's not right. 3 × 12 is actually 36. Yeah, because 12 + 12 is 24, and 24 + 12 is 36. So, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. No, wait, 12 × 3 is 36. Yeah, I was just confused for a second. So, three dozen is 36 eggs? No, no, 12 × 3 is 36? No, that's not correct. 12 × 3 is 36. So, three dozen is 36 eggs. Okay, that makes more sense.

So, Chatty has 36 eggs? Wait, no, 12 × 3 is 36? No, that's 36, but 36 is just 36, not 36 eggs. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. A dozen is 12, so three dozen is 3 × 12, which is 36. So, 36 is incorrect. It's 36 eggs? No, 36 is just 36, but in terms of eggs, it's 36 eggs. Wait, no, 36 is just 36, but 36 eggs is 3 dozen. So, 36 is 3 dozen, which is 36 eggs. Wait, that's confusing. Let me write it out.

Total eggs = 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36. So, 36 eggs. So, 36 eggs divided by 4 children. So, each child gets 36 ÷ 4. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 4. 4 goes into 36 nine times because 4 × 9 is 36. So, each child gets 9 eggs.

Wait, but 36 divided by 4 is 9. So, each child gets 9 eggs. That seems right. Let me double-check. If each child gets 9 eggs, and there are four children, then 9 × 4 is 36. Yes, that adds up. So, 36 eggs divided by 4 children is 9 eggs per child.

So, the answer is 9 eggs per child. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. 3 dozen is 36, divided by 4 is 9. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors here.

**Final Answer**
Each child receives \boxed{9} eggs.
</think>

Chatty has three dozen eggs, which is equivalent to \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs. She wants to distribute these eggs equally among her four children. 

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:
\[
\frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

Thus, each child receives \(\boxed{9}\) eggs.
