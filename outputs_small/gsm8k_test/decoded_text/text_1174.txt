Q: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account. Hmm, that means he took out some number of $10 bills, right? Let me see, if each bill is $10, then the total amount he took out is $1000. So, how many $10 bills is that? Well, $1000 divided by $10 per bill is 100 bills. So, he took out 100 bills. 

Now, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he started with 100 bills and lost 10 of them. That means he has 100 minus 10, which is 100 bills left. Wait, that's the same number? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. 100 minus 10 is indeed 100. So, he still has 100 bills. Hmm, interesting. So, he didn't lose any bills, just 10 of them. So, he still has 100 bills. 

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he has 100 bills, and he uses half of them. Half of 100 is 50. So, he uses 50 bills to pay for something. That means he has 100 minus 50, which is 50 bills left. 

After that, Thomas triples his money. Hmm, tripling his money. So, he has 50 bills left, and he triples his money. Wait, does tripling his money mean tripling the amount of money he has, or tripling the number of bills? The problem says he has 50 bills left, so tripling his money would mean tripling the amount of money, not the number of bills. But he uses those bills to pay for something, so maybe the number of bills is related to the money. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify. If he has 50 bills, and he triples his money, that would mean his total money is tripled. But he also converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. So, perhaps the number of bills is related to the amount of money he has. So, if he has 50 bills, and each bill is worth 5 dollars, then his total money is 50 times 5, which is 250 dollars. If he triples that, he would have 750 dollars. Then, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills, so how many 5 dollar bills does he have? 

Wait, let me go through this step by step. Maybe I should write down each step.

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. So, how many 20 dollar bills is that? 1000 divided by 20 is 50. So, he took out 50 bills.

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he started with 50 bills, lost 10, so he has 50 minus 10, which is 40 bills left.

3. Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he has 40 bills, uses half, which is 20 bills. So, he uses 20 bills, so he has 40 bills left.

4. After that, he triples his money. So, his money is tripled. But he has 40 bills left. So, if each bill is worth 20 dollars, then his total money is 40 times 20, which is 800 dollars. If he triples that, he has 2400 dollars. 

5. Then, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. So, how many 5 dollar bills does he have? His total money is 2400 dollars, and each bill is 5 dollars, so he has 2400 divided by 5, which is 480 bills.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.

Wait, step 1: 1000 divided by 20 is 50 bills. So, 50 bills. Then, he loses 10, so 50 minus 10 is 45 bills. Then, he uses half of the remaining bills, which is 22.5? Wait, no, he can't use half a bill. So, maybe he uses 22 bills, leaving him with 23 bills. Hmm, but the problem
