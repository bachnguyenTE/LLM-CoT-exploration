Q: Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Apple High School's graduation. They have a Fine Arts Center that can hold 6000 people. After accounting for some seats for graduates and faculty, they want to know how many tickets each graduate would get if the remaining seats are split equally among their friends and family. The answer is supposed to be in a box, so I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me try to understand the problem. They have a total capacity of 6000 seats. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates, and 300 seats are for faculty. So, the rest of the seats will be for the graduates' friends and family. The question is asking how many tickets each graduate would receive if the remaining seats are split equally.

So, I think the first step is to subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left for the graduates' friends and family. Then, since each graduate is supposed to get an equal number of tickets, I can divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate gets.

Let me write that down:

Total seats = 6000

Seats for graduates = 950

Seats for faculty = 300

So, seats left for friends and family = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty

Plugging in the numbers:

6000 - 950 - 300

Hmm, let me calculate that. First, subtract 950 from 6000. 6000 minus 900 is 5100, and then minus 55 more is 5045. Then, subtract 300 from 5045. 5045 minus 300 is 4745. So, there are 4745 seats left for the graduates' friends and family.

Now, the question is, how many tickets does each graduate receive? So, if there are 4745 seats and each graduate gets an equal number, we need to divide 4745 by the number of graduates. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many graduates there are. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, "how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?" So, maybe the number of graduates is implied or given somewhere else? Wait, the problem doesn't mention the number of graduates. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people. After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?"

Wait, so maybe the 950 seats are for graduates, and 300 seats are for faculty, so the rest is for friends and family. So, the number of friends and family is 4745, as I calculated before. But the problem is asking how many tickets each graduate would receive. So, if each graduate gets an equal number, but we don't know how many graduates there are.

Wait, maybe the problem is missing some information? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the 950 seats are for graduates, and the 300 seats are for faculty, so the rest is for friends and family. So, the number of friends and family is 4745. But the problem is asking how many tickets each graduate would receive. So, if each graduate gets the same number of tickets, but we don't know how many graduates there are, so maybe the number of tickets per graduate is 1? But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total number of tickets is 6000, and 950 are for graduates, 300 for faculty, so the remaining 4745 are for friends and family. So, if each graduate gets an equal number of tickets, but we don't know how many graduates, maybe the number of tickets per graduate is 1? But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the total number of tickets is 6000, and 950 are for graduates, 300 for faculty, so the remaining 4745 are for friends and family. So, if each graduate gets an equal number of tickets, but we don't know how many graduates, maybe the number of tickets per graduate is 1? But that seems odd.

Wait,
