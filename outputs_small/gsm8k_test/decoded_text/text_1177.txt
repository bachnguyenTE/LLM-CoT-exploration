Q: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Miss Albert's class. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the class has 12 boys and 12 girls. That means the total number of students is 12 plus 12, which is 24. Got that down. 

Now, the problem says that one-third of the girls are on varsity. Hmm, so I need to find out how many girls that is. Let me calculate that. If there are 12 girls and one-third are on varsity, then I can do 12 divided by 3. 

12 divided by 3 is 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity. That seems straightforward.

Next, it says one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Okay, so there are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity. 

Now, I need to find out how many students are not on varsity. To do that, I should first find the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

So, the total number of students on varsity is the sum of the girls on varsity and the boys on varsity. That would be 4 girls plus 3 boys. 

4 plus 3 is 7. So, 7 students are on varsity.

Now, the total number of students is 24, as I figured out earlier. So, the number of students not on varsity is 24 minus 7. 

24 minus 7 is 17. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 12 boys, one-fourth are on varsity, which is 3. 12 girls, one-third are on varsity, which is 4. 3 plus 4 is 7. 24 total minus 7 on varsity is 17. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this? Maybe by calculating the fractions of students not on varsity directly?

Let me try that. For the girls, one-third are on varsity, so two-thirds are not. So, two-thirds of 12 girls. Let me compute that. 12 times 2/3 is 4/3, which is approximately 1.333. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, I think we have to consider whole numbers. Wait, but in the problem, it's okay to have a fractional number? Or do we have to round it?

Wait, no, in the problem, the numbers are given as whole numbers, so I think we can assume that the number of students on varsity is also a whole number. So, maybe the fractions result in whole numbers when multiplied.

Wait, 12 girls, one-third are on varsity, so 4 are on varsity, which is a whole number. Similarly, 12 boys, one-fourth are on varsity, so 3 are on varsity, which is also a whole number. So, the total on varsity is 7, which is also a whole number. So, the number of students not on varsity is 24 minus 7, which is 17. 

So, 17 is the answer. 

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Maybe using fractions for the non-varsity students.

For the girls, one-third are on varsity, so two-thirds are not. So, 2/3 of 12 girls. 12 times 2/3 is 8. So, 8 girls are not on varsity.

For the boys, one-fourth are on varsity, so three-fourths are not. So, 3/4 of 12 boys. 12 times 3/4 is 9. So, 9 boys are not on varsity.

Now, adding those together: 8 girls plus 9 boys is 17. So, that's another way to get 17. 

So, that confirms it. 17 students are not on varsity.

I think that's solid. I considered two different methods: one where I added the number of varsity students and subtracted from the total, and another where I calculated the non-varsity students separately for boys and girls and then added them together. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel confident that 17 is the correct number of students not on varsity.

**Final Answer**
The number of students not on varsity is \boxed{17}.
