Q: Lori needed 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.  She anticipates that each of her guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves.  If she is inviting 16 guests to her party, how many dozens of eggs will she need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Lori needs to make deviled egg halves for her party. Let me try to figure out how many eggs she needs. Hmm, the problem says she needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. That means each half requires half an egg, right? Because 1 egg makes 2 halves. So, if she needs 2 halves per guest, each guest will eat 3 halves. Let me write that down.

First, let's figure out how many halves each guest will eat. The problem says each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves. So, if she has 16 guests, the total number of halves needed is 16 (since 16 times 3 is 18). Wait, no, hold on. 16 guests times 3 halves each is 48 halves. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, since each half is made from half an egg, the number of eggs needed is half of the total number of halves. So, 48 halves divided by 2 is 24 eggs. But wait, the question asks for how many dozens of eggs she needs. Since one dozen is 12, we can divide 24 by 12 to get the number of dozens. 24 divided by 12 is 2. So, she needs 2 dozen eggs.

Let me double-check that. Each guest eats 3 halves, so 16 guests eat 48 halves. Each half is half an egg, so 48 halves is 24 eggs. 24 eggs divided by 12 is 2 dozen. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward: total halves needed, convert to eggs, then convert to dozens. So, the answer should be 2 dozen eggs.

**Final Answer**
Lori will need \boxed{2} dozen eggs.

Lori needs to make deviled egg halves for her party. She needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, which means each half requires half an egg. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests.

First, calculate the total number of halves needed:
\[
16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves per guest} = 48 \text{ halves}
\]

Next, convert the total number of halves to eggs:
\[
48 \text{ halves} \div 2 = 24 \text{ eggs}
\]

Convert the number of eggs to dozens:
\[
24 \text{ eggs} \div 12 = 2 \text{ dozen}
\]

Thus, Lori will need \boxed{2} dozen eggs.
