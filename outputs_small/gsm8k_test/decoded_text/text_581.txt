Q: Max plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total time Max will spend watching both movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, adding 30 minutes gives a total of 96 minutes for the first movie.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives 120 minutes, and adding 5 minutes results in 125 minutes for the second movie.

To find the total time, I'll add the durations of both movies: 96 minutes + 125 minutes = 221 minutes.

To determine the total time Max will spend watching both movies, follow these steps:

1. **Convert the durations of both movies to minutes:**
   - **First Movie:** 1 hour and 30 minutes
     - 1 hour = 60 minutes
     - Total = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = **96 minutes**
   - **Second Movie:** 2 hours and 5 minutes
     - 2 hours = 120 minutes
     - Total = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = **125 minutes**

2. **Add the durations of both movies:**
   - **Total Time** = 96 minutes + 125 minutes = **221 minutes**

\boxed{221}
