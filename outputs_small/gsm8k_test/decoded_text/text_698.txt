Q: Greta’s paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. After funding her retirement and paying for her car, how much money does she have left to spend?

Okay, so I have this problem about Greta's paycheck and her expenses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. That seems straightforward. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her monthly car payment. After that, I need to find out how much money she has left to spend. Hmm, okay.

Let me break it down. Maybe I should start by calculating how much she puts into her retirement account. If she puts 50% of her $2400 into retirement, that should be 50% of 2400. To find that, I can convert 50% to a decimal, which is 0.50, and multiply it by 2400.

So, 0.50 times 2400. Let me do that multiplication. Hmm, 2400 times 0.5 is 1225, and 2400 times 0.0 is 240. So, adding those together, 1225 + 240 is 1465. So, she puts $1465 into her retirement account.

Wait, let me double-check that. 50% of 2400. Alternatively, 50% is the same as 50/100, so 50% is 1200, and 5% is 123, so 1200 + 123 is 1323. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 50% of 2400 should be 1323? Hmm, maybe I did that wrong.

Wait, no, 10% of 2400 is 240, so 50% is 5 times 240, which is 1200. So, 1200 is 50% of 2400. Okay, so that's correct. So, she puts $1200 into retirement? Wait, no, 50% is 1200, right? Because 50% of 2400 is 1200. So, 1200 is correct.

Wait, hold on, 50% is 1200, so 55% is 1200 + 1200? No, that's not right. Wait, 50% is 1200, so 55% is 1200 + 5% of 2400. 5% of 2400 is 120, so 1200 + 120 is 1320. So, 55% is 1320. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no, 50% is 1200, so 55% is 50% + 5%, which is 1200 + 120, which is 1320. So, she puts $1320 into retirement. Okay, that makes more sense.

So, she has $2400 - $1320 = $1080 left after retirement. Wait, no, 2400 - 1320 is 1080. So, $1080 left after retirement.

Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment. So, 20% of 2400. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.20 in decimal, so 0.20 times 2400. Let's see, 20% of 2000 is 440, and 22% of 400 is 88. So, 440 + 88 is 528. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, 20% of 2400. Let me do it step by step. 10% is 240, so 20% is 480. So, 20% of 2400 is 480. So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

So, after retirement and car payment, how much does she have left? She had $1080 after retirement, and then she spends $480 on the car. So, 1080 - 480 is 600. So, $
