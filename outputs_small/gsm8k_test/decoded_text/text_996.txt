Q: Four children are playing together—Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.

Okay, so I have this problem here with four kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. I need to figure out how old Wilfred is. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

It says Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The total age of all the children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, I need to find Wilfred's age.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, let's note down the given information:

- Akbar's age: 3 years
- Alessandro's age: 4 years
- Total age of all four children: 20 (I think that's 20 years, so 20 years total)
- Helene's age: twice the average age of the group
- Wilfred's age: ?

So, we have four children, and we know three of their ages. We need to find the fourth one, which is Wilfred.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since we know the total age of all four children, and we know two of their ages, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred. Then, using the information about Helene being twice the average age, we can set up an equation to solve for Wilfred's age.

First, let's denote the variables:

Let H be Helene's age.

Let W be Wilfred's age.

We know that Akbar is 3, Alessandro is 4, Helene is H, and Wilfred is W. So, the total age is:

3 + 4 + H + W = 20

So, 7 + H + W = 20

Therefore, H + W = 20 - 7 = 13

So, Helene and Wilfred together are 13 years old.

Now, the problem also says that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So, let's figure out the average age.

The average age is the total age divided by the number of children. The total age is 20, and there are 4 children, so the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

So, Helene is twice the average age, which is 2 * 5 = 10.

Therefore, Helene is 10 years old.

Wait, but if Helene is 10, and the total of Helene and Wilfred is 13, then Wilfred must be 13 - 10 = -7.

Wait, that can't be right. A negative age doesn't make sense. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back and check.

Total age is 20. Akbar is 3, Alessandro is 4, so 3 + 4 = 7. So, Helene and Wilfred together are 20 - 7 = 13. That seems correct.

Average age is 20 / 4 = 5. So, Helene is twice that, which is 10. So, Helene is 10.

But if Helene is 10, and the total of Helene and Wilfred is 13, then Wilfred is 13 - 10 = 3. That seems possible.

Wait, but if Helene is 10, and the average age is 5, then Helene is twice the average. That seems correct.

But then, if Helene is 10, and the total of all four is 20, then 10 + 3 + 4 + W = 20. So, 17 + W = 20, so W = 5.

Wait, hold on, that contradicts the previous conclusion.

Wait, so let me clarify.

If the average age is 5, then Helene is twice that, so 10. So, Helene is 10.

But if Helene is 10, and the total of all four is 20, then 10 + 3 + 4 + W = 20. So, 17 + W = 20, so W = 5.

But earlier, I thought that H + W = 13, which would mean if H is 10, W is 3. But that contradicts the total.

Wait, so which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. So, Helene is twice that, so 10. So, H = 10.

But then, H + W = 13, so W = 13 -
