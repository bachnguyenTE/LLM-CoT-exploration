Q: If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine Ann's current age, which is 9 years old.

Next, calculate her brother's current age by doubling Ann's age: 9 years × 2 = 18 years.

Finally, find out how old her brother will be in 3 years by adding 3 to his current age: 18 years + 3 years = 21 years.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Ann's Current Age:**
   
   Ann is **9 years old**.

2. **Calculate Her Brother's Current Age:**
   
   Her brother is **twice** as old as Ann.
   
   \[
   \text{Brother's Current Age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's Age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine Her Brother's Age in 3 Years:**
   
   \[
   \text{Brother's Age in 3 Years} = \text{Brother's Current Age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
