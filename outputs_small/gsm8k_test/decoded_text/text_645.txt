Q: A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?

Okay, so I have this problem here: "A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says there's a bag of flour that's divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, each bag is split into 8 parts, each part being 2 kg. Then, the question is asking how much flour was in three bags in total before they were divided into portions. So, essentially, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags, each of which is divided into 8 portions of 2 kg each.

Wait, hold on. So, is each bag divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg? So, each bag is 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag must be 8 multiplied by 2 kg, right? Let me calculate that.

8 portions * 2 kg per portion = 16 kg per bag. So, each bag is 6 kilograms. Then, if there are three bags, the total flour would be 3 bags * 6 kg per bag. Let me compute that.

3 * 6 = 18. So, the total flour is 18 kilograms.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, each bag is divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, 8 * 2 is 16 kg per bag. Then, three bags would be 3 * 16 kg? Wait, no, 3 * 16 is 48. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, 3 bags, each 6 kg, so 3 * 6 is 18 kg. So, that's correct. So, 18 kg is the total flour.

Wait, but let me think again. Is each bag divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg? So, each bag is 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 kg, which is 48 kg. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation.

Wait, no, 8 portions per bag, each 2 kg, so 8 * 2 is 16 kg per bag. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 kg, which is 48 kg. Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm confusing the number of portions. So, if a bag is divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg, then each bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 = 48 kg. So, that's 48 kg.

But wait, the initial problem says "A bag of divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each." So, is that 8 portions, each 2 kg, or is it 8 portions, each 2 kg? Wait, the way it's written is "divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each." So, that would be 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 = 48 kg.

Wait, but in the initial problem, it's written as "divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each." So, that's 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 = 48 kg. Wait, but 8 * 2 is 16, so 3 * 16 is 48. So, 48 kg.

Wait, but hold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me parse the sentence again: "A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each." So, the bag is divided into 8 portions, each of which is 2 kg. So, each portion is 2 kg, and there are 8 portions. So, each bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 * 16 = 48 kg.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the user wrote: "A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?"

So, the key here is that each bag is divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 8
