Q: Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Toula spent at the bakery. She bought different types of pastries, and I have to calculate the total cost. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what she bought:

1. Donuts: She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68.
2. Mini cupcakes: She bought 2 dozen, each costing $80.
3. Mini cheesecakes: She bought 6 dozen, each costing $55.

Hmm, wait, the cupcakes are $80? That seems a bit high, but okay, maybe it's a typo. Let me double-check. The original problem says $80 per dozen, so I'll go with that.

So, to find the total cost, I need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then add them all together.

Starting with the donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen. So, that would be 3 multiplied by 68. Let me compute that.

3 * 68. Hmm, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 8 is 24. So, 180 + 24 is 210. So, the cost for donuts is $210.

Next, the mini cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen. So, 2 multiplied by 80. Let me calculate that.

2 * 80. 2 times 80 is 160. So, the cost for cupcakes is $160.

Now, the mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen. So, 6 multiplied by 55. Let me do that.

6 * 55. 6 times 5 is 30, so 6 times 55 is 330. So, the cost for cheesecakes is $330.

Now, to find the total cost, I need to add up the costs of donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes.

So, that's $210 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $330 (cheesecakes).

Let me add them step by step.

First, add the donuts and cupcakes: 210 + 160. 200 + 100 is 300, and 10 + 60 is 70, so 300 + 70 is 370. So, that's $370 so far.

Now, add the cheesecakes: 370 + 330. 300 + 300 is 600, and 70 + 30 is 100, so 600 + 100 is 700. So, the total cost is $700.

Wait, let me verify that again because 370 + 330 is 700? Hmm, 370 + 300 is 670, and then +30 is 700. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can add them all together at once:

210 + 160 + 330.

Let me add 210 and 160 first: 210 + 160 is 370.

Then, 370 + 330: 370 + 300 is 670, plus 30 is 700. Yep, same result.

So, the total cost is $700.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps.

For donuts: 3 * 68. 68 * 3: 60*3=180, 8*3=24, 180+24=210. Correct.

For cupcakes: 2 *80. 80*2=160. Correct.

For cheesecakes: 6*55. 55*6: 50*6=300, 5*6=30, so 300+30=330. Correct.

Adding them: 210 + 160 + 330.

210 + 160: 210 + 100 is 310, 60 left, so 310 + 60 is 370. Then, 370 + 330: 370 + 300 is 670, plus 3
