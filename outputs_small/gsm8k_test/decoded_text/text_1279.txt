Q: Avery needs to buy a 3 piece place setting (dinner & salad plate and a bowl) for her holiday dinner.  She’s having 12 people over for dinner.  If the dinner plates cost $6.00 each and bowls each cost $5.00 and the salad plates cost $4.00, how much will she spend on place settings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of each type of place setting Avery is using. She has three options: a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

The dinner plate costs $6.00, the salad plate costs $4.00, and the bowl costs $5.00.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for all three place settings by adding their individual costs together.

Finally, I'll sum up the costs of the dinner plate, salad plate, and bowl to find the total amount Avery will spend on place settings.
