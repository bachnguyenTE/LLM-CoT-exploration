A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ophelia and Jenna living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Ophelia has 20 sofas, and I need to find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Ophelia has 20 sofas. So, Ophelia's number of sofas is 20. Now, it says they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, that means Jenna has 22 chairs? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think. If Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, then the number of chairs is 2 more than the number of sofas. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, then chairs for Ophelia would be 20 + 2 = 24. Is that right? Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.

The problem says: "Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs." So, for each of them, the number of sofas is 2 less than the number of chairs. So, if Ophelia has S sofas, then she has C chairs where C = S + 2. Similarly, Jenna has J chairs, and her number of sofas is J - 2. But it also says Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, J = 3 * S.

Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so S = 20. Therefore, Ophelia's chairs would be C = 20 + 2 = 24. Then, Jenna's chairs would be J = 3 * 20 = 60. So, Jenna has 60 chairs and 60 - 2 = 58 sofas.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then she has 22 chairs? Or is it 20 + 2? Wait, the problem says "2 fewer sofas than chairs." So, if Ophelia has S sofas, then chairs are S + 2. So, if S = 20, then chairs = 22. So, Ophelia has 22 chairs. Then, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs. Then, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Wait, so Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs. Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. So, total number of sofas would be 20 + 64 = 84. Total number of chairs would be 22 + 66 = 88. So, total number of furniture pieces is 84 + 88 = 172.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says "they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs." So, for each person, the number of chairs is 2 more than the number of sofas. So, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so chairs are 22. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so 3*22=66 chairs. Then, since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64. So, yes, that seems correct.

So, Ophelia: 20 sofas, 22 chairs.

Jenna: 64 sofas, 66 chairs.

Total sofas: 20 + 64 = 84.

Total chairs: 22 + 66 = 88.

Total furniture: 84 + 88 = 172.

Wait, but let me check if the problem is asking for the total number of furniture pieces, which would be both sofas and chairs. So, yes, 84 + 88 = 172.

But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says "they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs." So, for each person, the number of chairs is 2 more than the number of sofas. So, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so chairs are 24. Then, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so 3*24=72 chairs. Then, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so
