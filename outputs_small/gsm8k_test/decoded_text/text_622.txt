Q: Jim has a 20 pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Jim and his gum. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Jim has a 20-piece pack of gum. He chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. His school day lasts 8 hours. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner. Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister when she asks for some right before bed. The question is, how many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

Alright, so let's break this down. First, Jim starts with 20 pieces. Then, he spends time at school, which is 8 hours. For every 2 hours he's at school, he chews 1 piece. So, I need to figure out how many pieces he chews during the school day.

Let me calculate that. If he chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and his school day is 8 hours, then how many pieces does he chew during school? Well, 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, he chews 4 pieces during school. That makes sense because 2 hours per piece, 8 hours total, so 4 pieces.

Now, he also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 1 + 1 = 2 more pieces. So, total pieces he chews during the day is 4 (school) + 2 (other times) = 6 pieces.

So, he starts with 20 pieces, chews 6 pieces during the day. So, 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left after the day.

But wait, hold on. The problem says he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister when she asks for some right before bed. So, after he chews 6 pieces, he has 14 left. Then, he gives half of that to his sister. So, half of 14 is 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Therefore, the number of pieces he has left is 14 - 7. Wait, that can't be right because 14 minus 7 is negative. That doesn't make sense. So, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go back. He starts with 20. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours for 8 hours, so 4 pieces. Then, he chews 1 on the way home and 1 after dinner, so 2 more. So, total of 6 pieces. 20 - 6 = 14. Then, he gives half to his sister, so 14 / 2 = 7. So, 14 - 7 = 7. Wait, that's positive. So, he has 7 pieces left.

But wait, 14 pieces after school, he gives half to his sister, so he gives 7, so he has 7 left. That seems correct. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the process step by step.

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces.

2. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours for 8 hours. So, 8 / 2 = 4 pieces. So, he chews 4 pieces during school.

3. Then, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, 1 +1 = 2 pieces. So, total of 4 + 2 = 6 pieces.

4. So, 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left after the day.

5. Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, half of 14 is 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

6. Therefore, he has 14 -7 = 7 pieces left.

Wait, but 14 -7 is 7, so he has 7 left. That seems correct.

But let me think again. Is the process correct? He chews 6 pieces during the day, so 20 -6=14. Then, he gives half to his sister, so he has 14 -7=7 left.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives 7, so he has 7 left. So, 7 is the answer.

But let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. It says he chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. So, 8 hours, so 4 pieces. Then, he chews 1 on the way home and 1 after
