Q: John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep.  It cost $.1 per cubic foot to fill.  How much does it cost to fill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John is filling a pool, and I need to figure out how much it will cost him. Let me read it again: "John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep. It costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill. How much does it cost to fill?" Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply that by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let me visualize the pool. It's a rectangular pool, right? So, the dimensions given are length, width, and depth. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet, and it's 5 feet deep. So, I think the volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying length, width, and depth. That makes sense because volume is a three-dimensional measurement.

So, let me write that down. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = length × width × depth

Plugging in the numbers, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 5 feet. So, Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft. Let me compute that.

First, 6 multiplied by 4 is 24. Then, 24 multiplied by 5 is 120. So, the volume is 120 cubic feet. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 6 times 4 is 24, and 24 times 5 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. So, I need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot. That would be 120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot. Let me compute that.

120 multiplied by 0.1. Hmm, 120 times 0.1 is the same as 120 divided by 10, which is 12. So, the total cost is $12.00.

Wait, hold on, 120 times 0.1 is 12, right? Because 10 times 0.1 is 1, so 120 is 10 times 12, so 10 times 12 is 20, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 120 times 0.1 is 12.00, which is $12.00. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.00. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but considering the pool is only 5 feet deep, maybe it's right. Let me think again.

Wait, 6 feet by 4 feet is 24 square feet, and 24 square feet times 5 feet is 120 cubic feet. So, that's correct. Then, 120 cubic feet times $0.1 per cubic foot is $12.00. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward. So, the cost is $12.00.

**Final Answer**
The cost to fill the pool is \boxed{12} dollars.

John is filling a rectangular pool that is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. To find the cost, we first calculate the volume of the pool using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[
\text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
