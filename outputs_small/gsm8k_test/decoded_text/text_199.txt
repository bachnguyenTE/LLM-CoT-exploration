Q: Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mark being a copy-editor. He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, right? And he works for two different publishers. Each publisher pays him a different rate per sentence. The problem says that Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. Also, Mark is paid 5 cents per sentence by Publisher A. I need to figure out how much Mark makes in a week in cents.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. That's the total number of sentences he does. Now, he works for two publishers, so he must be splitting his work between them. Each publisher has a different rate, so the amount he gets paid will depend on how many sentences he edits for each publisher.

Let me denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B would be 1000 minus x, right? So that's 1000 - x.

Now, the payment for each publisher is based on the number of sentences he edits for them. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so the amount he gets from Publisher A would be 5 cents multiplied by x. That would be 5x cents.

For Publisher B, the payment is twice what Publisher A pays. So, if Publisher A pays 5x cents, Publisher B would pay 2 times that, which is 2 * 5x = 10x cents.

So, the total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he gets from both publishers. That would be 5x (from A) plus 10x (from B). Let me write that out:

Total payment = 5x + 10x = 15x cents.

But wait, we also know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. So, the total number of sentences he edits is x (for A) plus (1000 - x) (for B). Let me write that equation:

x + (1000 - x) = 1000.

Hmm, that simplifies to 1000 = 1000, which is just a tautology. That doesn't help me find x. So, maybe I need another equation or a different approach.

Wait, actually, I think I already have the total payment in terms of x. The total payment is 15x cents. But I don't know x yet. Maybe I can express the total payment in another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total sentences and the rates. Let me denote the rate for Publisher A as r_A and for Publisher B as r_B. The problem says that r_B is twice r_A. So, r_B = 2 * r_A.

Given that, the total payment would be r_A * x + r_B * (1000 - x). Substituting r_B with 2 * r_A, that becomes:

Total payment = r_A * x + 2 * r_A * (1000 - x).

Factor out r_A:

Total payment = r_A [x + 2*(1000 - x)].

Simplify inside the brackets:

x + 2000 - 2x = 2000 - x.

So, Total payment = r_A * (2000 - x).

But we know that r_A is 5 cents per sentence, so substituting that in:

Total payment = 5 * (2000 - x).

But wait, I don't know x yet. Hmm, maybe I need another equation here.

Wait, but I also know that the total number of sentences is 1000, so x + (1000 - x) = 1000. That doesn't help either. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can express the total payment in terms of the total sentences. Let me think.

If Mark edits 1000 sentences in total, and he gets paid based on the number of sentences he edits for each publisher, then the total payment is 5x + 2*5x, which is 5x +10x=15x. So, total payment is 15x cents.

But I don't know x. So, is there another way to find x?

Wait, maybe I can think about the rates. Since the total sentences are 1000, and he edits x for A and (1000 -x) for B, the total payment is 5x + 10(1000 -x). So, 5x +10000 -10x=10000 -5
