Q: Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him. Their son is currently half as old as his mom and their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. How old is Steve's son's wife?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Steve, his wife, their son, and their son's wife. I need to figure out how old Steve's son's wife is. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the information given:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.

Alright, so I need to find the age of Steve's son's wife. Let me see how to approach this.

Starting with Steve and his wife. Steve is 60, and his wife is 4 years older. So, if I add 4 to Steve's age, that should give me his wife's age. Let me write that down:

Steve's age = 60 years
Wife's age = Steve's age + 4 = 60 + 4 = 68 years

So, Steve's wife is 68 years old. Got that.

Next, it says their son is currently half as old as his mom. So, the son's age is half of his mom's age. Let me denote the son's age as S and his mom's age as M. So, the equation would be:

S = (1/2) * M

But wait, I don't know the son's age yet. Hmm, maybe I can find the son's age in another way. Let me think.

Wait, the son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, if I can find the son's age, I can find his wife's age, and then subtract 3 to get the son's wife's age.

But I need to find the son's age first. Since the son is half as old as his mom, and the mom is Steve's wife, who is 68. So, the mom is 68, so the son is half of that.

Let me write that:

Mom's age = 68
Son's age = (1/2) * 68 = 34

So, the son is 34 years old. Now, the son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, her husband is the son, who is 34. Therefore, her wife is 34 - 3 = 31.

Wait, so Steve's son's wife is 31 years old? Let me just double-check that.

Steve is 60, wife is 68, son is half the wife's age, so 34. Son's wife is 3 years younger than the son, so 34 - 3 = 31. That seems right.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. So, Steve is 60, wife is 68. Son is half of the wife, so 34. Son's wife is 3 years younger than the son, so 34 - 3 = 31. Yeah, that seems consistent.

I don't think I missed anything here. The key was to find the wife's age step by step, starting from Steve's age, then his wife, then the son, and finally the son's wife.

So, yeah, I think the answer is 31.

**Final Answer**
The son's wife is \boxed{31} years old.

Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so her age is:

\[ 60 + 4 = 68 \]

Their son is currently half as old as his mom (his wife). Therefore, the son's age is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 68 = 34 \]

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son). Therefore, the son's wife's age is:

\[ 34 - 3 = 31 \]

The son's wife is \boxed{31} years old.
