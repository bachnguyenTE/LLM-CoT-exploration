Q: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?

Okay, so I have this problem about porcupines in a park. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the population is 50 porcupines. Hmm, that's the total number. Then it says the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, I need to find out how many female porcupines there are.

Alright, so if the total population is 50, and the females are 3/5 of that, I can calculate the number of females by multiplying 50 by 3/5. Let me write that down: 50 * (3/5). Hmm, 50 divided by 5 is 10, and 10 times 3 is 30. So, there are 33 female porcupines. Wait, that seems a bit high because 3/5 of 50 is 33, but 50 minus 33 is 22, which would be the number of males. That makes sense.

Now, each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, I need to find out how many babies are born in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, I can multiply the number of female porcupines by 4 and then by 12. Let me break that down.

First, each female has 4 babies per month. So, 33 females * 4 babies/month = 132 babies per month. Then, over a year, that would be 132 * 12. Let me calculate that. 132 times 10 is 1320, and 132 times 2 is 264, so adding those together gives 1320 + 264 = 1584. So, 1584 babies in a year.

But wait, the question is asking for the total number of porcupines after a year. So, I need to add the new babies to the existing population. The original population is 50, and the new babies are 1584. So, 50 + 1584. Let me add those: 50 + 1500 is 1550, and then 84 more is 1634. So, 1634 porcupines in total after a year.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3/5 of 50 is indeed 33, because 50 divided by 5 is 10, times 3 is 30, wait, hold on, 50 divided by 5 is 10, 10 times 3 is 30, not 33. Wait, did I do that right earlier? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, 50 divided by 5 is 10, 10 times 3 is 30, so the number of female porcupines is 30, not 33. That changes things. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 3/5 of 50 is 33. It should be 30. Let me correct that.

So, if there are 30 female porcupines, each giving birth to 4 babies every month, then per month, the number of babies is 30 * 4 = 120. Then, over a year, that's 120 *12. Let me compute that. 120 *10 is 1200, and 120 *2 is 240, so 1200 + 240 = 1440. So, 1440 babies in a year.

Now, adding that to the original population of 50, so 50 + 1440. Let me add those: 50 + 1440. 50 + 1400 is 1450, and then +40 is 1490. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the number of female porcupines.

So, let me go back. The total population is 50. 3/5 of that is 30, not 33. So, 30 female porcupines. Each gives 4 babies per month, so 33 *4 = 132 per month. 132 *12 = 1584. Then, 50 +1584 = 1634.
