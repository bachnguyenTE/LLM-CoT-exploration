Q: The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.  The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a jumbo bottle of shampoo, and I need to figure out how much each pump costs in cents. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the jumbo bottle costs $24.00. That seems straightforward. Then, the directions mention using 2 pumps to get 120 washings. So, if I use 2 pumps, I get 120 washings. Now, the question is, if Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost in cents?

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to find the cost per pump. Let me see. If 2 pumps give me 120 washings, then 1 pump would give me half of that, right? So, 120 divided by 2 is 60 washings per pump. Wait, 120 divided by 2 is 60? Let me check that. 120 divided by 2 is 60. Yeah, that's correct.

So, each pump gives 60 washings. Now, the total cost is $24.00 for the whole bottle. So, if each pump gives 60 washings, how much does each pump cost?

I think I need to find the cost per washing first and then multiply by the number of washings per pump. Wait, no, actually, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

If 2 pumps give 120 washings for $24.00, then each pump gives 60 washings for half the cost. So, the cost per pump would be half of $24.00, which is $12.00. But wait, that seems too high because 60 washings at $12.00 per pump would be 60 times 12.00, which is way more than 120 washings. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another way. If 2 pumps give 120 washings for $24.00, then the cost per washing is $24.00 divided by 124 washings. Wait, 120 washings is 240? No, wait, 2 pumps give 120 washings for $24.00. So, 120 washings cost $24.00. So, per washing, it's $24.00 divided by 120 washings.

Let me calculate that. $24.00 divided by 120 washings. So, 24 divided by 120 is 0.2. So, that's $0.20 per washing. So, each washing costs 20 cents.

But the question is about the cost per pump. So, if each washing is 20 cents, and each pump gives 60 washings, then each pump would cost 60 washings times 20 cents per washing. So, 60 times 20 is 1200 cents. Which is $12.00.

Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. If 2 pumps give 120 washings for $24.00, then 1 pump gives 60 washings for $12.00. So, each pump is $12.00, which is 1200 cents. That seems correct.

But let me think about it another way. If 2 pumps give 120 washings for $24.00, then 1 pump gives 60 washings for half the cost, which is $12.00. So, each pump is $12.00, which is 1200 cents. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of unit cost. The total cost is $24.00 for 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is 24.00 / 120. Let me compute that.

24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 divided by 120. Let me write that as a fraction: 24/120. Simplify that. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 12. 24 divided by 12 is 2, and 120 divided by 12 is 10. So, 2/10, which is 0.2. So, 0.2 dollars per washing, which is 20 cents per washing.

So, each washing is 20 cents.
