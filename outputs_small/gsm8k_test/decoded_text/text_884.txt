Q: Argo has 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. How many toys does Argo have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many toys Argo gives away in total. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. Adding these together: 40 + 80 + 30 equals 162 toys.

Next, I'll subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys Argo had, which was 200. So, 200 minus 162 equals 138.

Therefore, Argo now has 138 toys left.

**Solution:**

Argo starts with **200 toys**. He gives away the following amounts:

- **40 toys** to Alyssa

\]

**Final Answer:**
