Q: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sue and her sister eating cookies over two days, and I need to figure out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. The sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day. Each cookie has 200 calories. I need to find how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

Alright, so let's list out the information:

- Sister's Monday cookies: 5
- Sister's Tuesday cookies: 13
- Sue's Monday cookies: 4 times the sister's Monday
- Sue's Tuesday cookies: 2 times the sister's Tuesday
- Calories per cookie: 200 (I think that's 200 calories, but maybe it's 200 calories? Wait, 200 is a number, but calories are usually in numbers like 100 or 200. Maybe it's 200 calories? Hmm, maybe it's 200 calories? Let me check the problem again. It says "1 cookie has 200 calories." So, yeah, 200 calories per cookie. So, Sue and her sister each have 200 calories per cookie.

So, first, let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 *13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

So, Sue's total cookies: Monday + Tuesday = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister's total cookies: Monday + Tuesday = 5 +13 = 18 cookies.

Now, each cookie has 200 calories, so let's calculate the total calories each consumed.

Sue's calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie.

Wait, hold on, 46 cookies? Wait, no, Sue ate 20 on Monday and 26 on Tuesday, so 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 46? Wait, 20 +26 is 26, 20 +26 is 26? Wait, no, 20 +26 is 26? Wait, 20 +26 is 2
