Q: There are some oranges in a basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ana and Jane peeling oranges. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. They start peeling oranges at the same time, and we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour. Hmm, okay.

Alright, so let's break this down. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. Similarly, Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. We need to find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

An hour is 60 minutes, right? So, let me calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes.

Starting with Ana. If she peels one orange every 3 minutes, then in 60 minutes, how many oranges can she peel? I think I can use division here. So, 60 divided by 3. Let me do that: 60 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 6 twice, and 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, that's 20. Wait, no, 3 times 20 is 60. So, Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour.

Now, Jane. She takes 4 minutes per orange. So, in 60 minutes, how many oranges can she peel? Again, division. 60 ÷ 4. Let me calculate that. 4 goes into 6 once, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So, that's 15. So, Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour.

Wait, let me double-check that. 4 times 15 is 60, yes, that's correct. And 3 times 20 is 60, so that's right too. So, Ana peels 20, Jane peels 15.

Now, the question is asking how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane. So, subtract the number Jane peeled from the number Ana peeled. That would be 20 - 15. Let me do that: 20 minus 15 is 5. So, Ana has peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Sometimes when I do division, I might slip up.

For Ana: 60 minutes divided by 3 minutes per orange. 60 ÷ 3 is 20. That seems right. 3 times 20 is 60, so that's correct.

For Jane: 60 minutes divided by 4 minutes per orange. 60 ÷ 4 is 15. 4 times 15 is 60, so that's also correct.

Subtracting 15 from 20 gives 5. So, yes, Ana has peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour is \boxed{5}.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. We need to find out how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (an hour) and then find the difference.

For Ana:
- In 60 minutes, the number of oranges peeled is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).

For Jane:
- In 60 minutes, the number of oranges peeled is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \).

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is:
- \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Thus, the number of more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour is \(\boxed{5}\).
