Q: There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a class of 40 pupils. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, half of the class likes blue. So, if there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 divided by 2, which is 20. So, 20 pupils like blue. Got that down.

Now, the problem says that one-fourth of the remaining likes green. Hmm, so after the blue group, there are some left. Let me see, if 20 like blue, then the remaining number of pupils is 40 minus 20, which is 24. So, 24 pupils are left. One-fourth of these 24 likes green. Let me calculate that. One-fourth of 24 is 24 divided by 4, which is 6. So, 6 pupils like green.

Alright, so now we have 20 pupils who like blue and 6 pupils who like green. The rest of the pupils must like yellow. So, to find out how many like yellow, I need to subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils.

So, total pupils are 40, right? Wait, hold on, the problem says 40 pupils. Wait, 40 or 44? Let me check the original problem again. It says, "There are 40 pupils in a class." So, 40. So, 40 pupils in total.

Wait, so if 20 like blue, 6 like green, then the number who like yellow is 40 minus 20 minus 6. Let me compute that. 40 minus 20 is 20, and 20 minus 6 is 14. So, 14 pupils like yellow.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 20 like blue, 6 like green, so 20 plus 6 is 26. Then, 40 minus 26 is 14. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. So, half of 40 is 20, that's correct. Then, the remaining is 20, right? Wait, no, wait, 40 minus 20 is 20. So, the remaining is 20, not 24. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, the problem says, "One-fourth of the remaining likes green." So, the remaining after blue is 20. So, 40 minus 20 is 20. So, the remaining is 20. Then, one-fourth of 20 is 5. So, 5 pupils like green. Then, the rest like yellow. So, 40 minus 20 minus 5 is 19. So, 19 pupils like yellow.

Wait, now I'm confused. So, which one is correct? Did I misread the problem?

Let me read it again: "There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?"

So, half of the class likes blue. So, 40 divided by 2 is 20. So, 20 like blue. Then, the remaining is 20. Then, one-fourth of the remaining likes green. So, one-fourth of 20 is 5. So, 5 like green. Then, the rest like yellow. So, 20 minus 5 is 15. So, 15 like yellow.

Wait, so now I'm getting 15 as the answer. But earlier, I thought it was 14. So, which is correct?

Wait, let me do the math again. 40 pupils total. Half like blue: 44 divided by 2 is 22. Wait, hold on, 44? Wait, no, 40 divided by 2 is 20. So, 20 like blue. Then, the remaining is 40 minus 20, which is 20. So, 20 pupils left. Then, one-fourth of 20 is 5. So, 5 like green. Then, the rest like yellow: 20 minus 5 is 15. So, 15 pupils like yellow.

Wait, so which is correct? 15 or 14? Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me go step by step.

Total pupils: 40.
