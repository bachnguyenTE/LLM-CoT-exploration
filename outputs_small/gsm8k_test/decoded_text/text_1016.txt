Q: Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the price of carrots after each year, considering the 5% annual increase.

Starting with the initial price of $120, I'll calculate the price after the first year by adding 5% of $120 to the original price.

Next, I'll apply the same 5% increase to the new price obtained after the first year to find the price at the end of the second year.

Finally, I'll apply the 5% increase again to the price from the second year to find the final price after three years.

After calculating the price for each year, I'll round the final amount to the nearest integer to get the total price after three years.

**Solution:**

We start with the initial price of carrots at **\$120**. The price increases by **5%** each year. To find the price after three years, we'll apply the 5% increase year by year.

1. **After the first year:**
   \[
   \text{Price} = 120 + (120 \times 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 = \$126.00
   \]

2. **After the second year:**
   \[
   \text{Price} = 126.00 + (126.00 \times 0.05) = 126.00 \times 1.05 = \$135.90
   \]

3. **After the third year:**
   \[
   \text{Price} = 135.90 + (135.90 \times 0.05) = 135.90 \times 1.05 = \$142.695
   \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the final price after three years is:

\[
\boxed{142695}
\]
