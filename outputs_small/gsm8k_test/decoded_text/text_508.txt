Q: The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.  How many animals do the farm and zoo have combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a farm and a zoo with different animals, and I need to figure out how many animals they have combined. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says the farm has 30 cows. That seems straightforward. Then, the zoo has 20 sheep. Hmm, okay. Now, the next part says the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Wait, so if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo must have double that number. Let me write that down to make it clearer.

So, farm cows = 30. Zoo cows = 2 * farm cows = 2 * 30 = 60. So, the zoo has 60 cows. Got that.

Then, the problem mentions the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. The zoo has 20 sheep, so half of that would be 10 sheep on the farm. Let me check that: 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep. Yep, that makes sense.

So, now I have the numbers for each animal in both the farm and the zoo. Let me list them out to make sure I don't miss anything.

Farm:
- Cows: 30
- Sheep: 10
- I don't know about other animals, but the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe I don't need to consider them.

Zoo:
- Cows: 60
- Sheep: 20
- Again, the problem doesn't specify other animals, so I think I can ignore those.

Wait, hold on. The problem says the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. Then, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, I think I have all the numbers covered.

Now, to find the combined total of all animals in both the farm and the zoo. So, I need add up all the cows, sheep, and any other animals. But wait, the problem doesn't mention any other animals, so I think I can just add the cows and sheep from both places.

So, farm animals: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

Zoo animals: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Wait, hold on, 30 cows on the farm, 60 cows on the zoo. So, 30 + 60 = 90 cows in total.

Similarly, 10 sheep on the farm, 20 sheep on the zoo. So, 10 + 20 = 30 sheep in total.

So, total animals would be 90 cows + 30 sheep = 120 animals.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, the problem says the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 20 sheep. Then, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so 2*30=60. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so 20/2=10. So, farm has 30 cows, 10 sheep. Zoo has 60 cows, 20 sheep.

So, total cows: 30 + 60 = 90.

Total sheep: 10 +20 =30.

Total animals: 90 +30=120.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Is there any other animal that I might have missed? The problem doesn't mention any other animals, so I think 120 is the right answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, farm has 30 cows, zoo has 60 cows. 33 +66 is 99, but wait, 30 +60 is 90. Wait, 30 +60 is 90? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, no, 30 +60 is 90? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, no, 30 +60 is 90? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, no, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, 30 +60 is 93? Wait, 30 +60 is 90, plus 3 is 93? Wait, no, 30 +60 is 9
