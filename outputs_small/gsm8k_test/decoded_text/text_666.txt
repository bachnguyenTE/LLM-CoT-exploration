Q: Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. Arelia has $120. The question is asking how much each of them would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out what I know:

1. Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia.
3. Arelia has $120.

So, we have four people: Rayna, Kassidy, Aurelia, and Arelia. Each has some amount of money, and we need to find out how much each would have if they combine their money and split it equally.

Let me assign variables to each person's money to make it easier. Let's say:

- R = Rayna's money
- K = Kassidy's money
- A = Aurelia's money
- Ar = Arelia's money

From the problem, we know:

1. R = K + 60
2. K = (3/4) * A
3. Ar = 120

So, we have three equations here. But we have four variables, which might seem like a problem. But wait, we can express everything in terms of one variable, maybe A, since we have K in terms of A, and R in terms of K, which is in terms of A.

Let me write that down:

From equation 2: K = (3/4) * A

From equation 1: R = K +60 = (3/4)A +60

And we know Ar = 120, so Arelia has $120.

So, now we have R, K, and A in terms of A. But we don't know A yet. So, we need to find A.

Wait, do we have any other information? The problem doesn't mention any other relationships or amounts. It just says that Rayna has 60 more than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much as Aurelia. Arelia has 120. So, maybe we need to find A from somewhere else?

Wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is just about adding their money together and sharing equally, so perhaps we don't need to know A? Let me read the question again.

"If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"

Wait, so maybe the question is just about combining their money and splitting equally, regardless of their individual amounts? So, perhaps we don't need to know A? Hmm, but we do have R, K, and A in terms of A, so maybe we can express the total amount in terms of A and then see if we can find A.

Wait, but we don't have any other information about the total money. The problem only gives us the relationships between R, K, and A, and Arelia's amount. So, perhaps we need to find A first.

Wait, but how? Because we have R, K, and A in terms of A, but we don't have any other equation that relates them. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says: "Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"

So, perhaps the problem is just about combining their money and splitting equally, regardless of their individual amounts. So, maybe we don't need to know A, but we can express the total in terms of A, and then see if we can find A.

Wait, but without another equation, we can't find A. So, maybe the problem is expecting us to express the total in terms of A, but since the question is asking how much each would have, maybe we can express it in terms of A, but the answer is in terms of A? But the answer is a numerical value, right?

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

"Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?"
