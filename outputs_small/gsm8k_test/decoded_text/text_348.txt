Q: A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a factory that used to make tractors but now makes silos. I need to figure out what percentage more they're making per day now compared to before. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the original situation. Before the factory started making silos, they made tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, I think I need to calculate their daily revenue before they switched to making silos.

Alright, so if they sold 10 tractors a day and each tractor was $100, then their daily revenue would be 10 tractors multiplied by $100 per tractor. Let me write that down:

Original daily revenue = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the new situation. They're making silos now. They sell 5 silos a day, and each silo brings in $220. So, I need to calculate their new daily revenue.

New daily revenue = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = ?

Let me compute that. 5 times 220. Hmm, 5 times 200 is 1000, and 5 times 20 is 100, so adding those together, 1000 + 100 = $1100/day.

Wait, so their daily revenue has gone up from $1000 to $1100. That's an increase of $100 per day. But the question is asking for the percentage increase. So, I need to find out what percentage $100 is of the original daily revenue, which was $1000.

To find the percentage increase, I can use the formula:

Percentage increase = (Increase / Original amount) * 100%.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Increase = $1100 - $1000 = $100.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. If the original was $1000 and the new is $1100, the increase is $100. So, the increase is $100, and the original is $1000. So, 100 divided by 1000 is 0.1, and multiplying by 100% gives 10%. So, the percentage increase is 10%.

Wait, let me double-check that. Original revenue was $1000, new revenue is $1100. So, the difference is $100. So, 100 divided by 1000 is 0.1, which is 10%. So, yes, that seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through it again.

Original daily revenue: 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000.

New daily revenue: 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100.

Difference: $1110 - $1000 = $110.

Wait, hold on, that's $110, not $100. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, 5 times 220 is 1100, right? 5*200=1000, 5*20=100, so 1000+100=1100. So, $1110? Wait, no, 5*220 is 1100? Wait, 220*5: 200*5=1000, 20*5=110, so 1000+110=1111? Wait, no, 220*5 is 1100? Wait, 220*5=1100, 2*5=10, so 1100+10=1110? Wait, no, 220*5 is 1100? Wait, 220*5 is 1100, but 220 is 220, so 220*5 is 1110? Wait, 220*5: 200*5=1000, 20*5=100, 2*5=10, so 1000+100+10=11110?
