Q: After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Erin has scored 14 points now, and at that point, her total points are three times more than what Sara has.. Sara scored 8 points. So, I need to find out how many points Erin had before she scored those 14 points.

Wait, so before scoring 14 points, Erin had some number of points, let's call that number E. After scoring 14, her total becomes E + 14. And according to the problem, this new total is three times more than what Sara has. But wait, Sara only scored 8 points, so does that mean her total is 8? Or is it that her current points are 8? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Let me read it again: "After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8." So, after scoring 14, Erin's points are three times more than Sara's. So, if Sara scored 8, then three times more would be 3 times 8, which is 24. So, does that mean that after scoring 14, Erin has 24 points?

Wait, but if that's the case, then before scoring 14, Erin must have had 24 minus 14, which is 10 points. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe "three times more than" is interpreted differently. Sometimes, "three times more" can mean three times as much as the original. So, if Sara scored 8, then three times more would be 3*8=24. So, that would mean Erin's current points are 24, so before scoring 14, she had 24 -14=10. So, 10 points.

But wait, let me think again. If "three times more than" is used, does that mean 3 times the original amount, or 3 times the current amount? Hmm, in common language, "three times more" can be ambiguous. It could mean three times the original or three times the current.

Wait, let's see. If I have something that is three times more than something else, that usually means it's three times the original. For example, if I have three times more money than I had before, that would mean I have three times the original amount. So, in this case, if after scoring 14, Erin has three times more than Sara, who scored 8, then that would mean 3*8=24. So, 24 points. So, before scoring 14, she had 24 -14=10.

But let me make sure. Alternatively, if it's three times as much as Sara's current points, which is 8, then 3*8=24, so same result. So, regardless, it seems like 24 is the current points, so before it was 10.

Wait, but let me think about the wording again: "Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8." So, "three times more" is relative to what? Is it relative to Sara's original points or her current points?

If it's relative to Sara's original points, which is 8, then three times more would be 24, so 24. So, before scoring 14, she had 24 -14=10.

Alternatively, if it's relative to her current points, which is 24, then three times more would be 72, which seems too high. So, that doesn't make sense.

Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that "three times more" is relative to Sara's original points, which is 8. So, 3*8=24, so current points are 24, so before scoring 14, she had 24 -14=10.

Wait, but let me think again. If "three times more than" is used, it's often used to mean three times as much as the original. So, if you have three times more of something, it's three times the original. So, if Sara scored 8, then three times more would be 24, so Erin's current points are 24, so before scoring 14, she had 10.

Alternatively, if it's three times as much as her current points, that would be 3*24=72, which is not the case here because she only
