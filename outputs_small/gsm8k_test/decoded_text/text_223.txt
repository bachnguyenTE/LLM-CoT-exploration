Q: A company spends $15000 on advertising for a year, and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year.  What's the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years?

Okay, so I have this problem here where a company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. Then, they spend a third of that amount on advertising for another year. I need to find the total amount they spent on advertising over the two years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The company spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year. Then, in the second year, they spend a third of that amount. So, I need to calculate both amounts and add them together to get the total expenditure.

Alright, so the first part is straightforward: $15,0000. I can write that as $15,000. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it's written as $15000, which I think is a typo because the comma is usually used as a decimal separator, not a thousand separator. So, I should probably write it as $15,000. Hmm, maybe that's a typo in the problem. Let me check.

Wait, the problem says: "A company spends $15000 on advertising for a year, and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year." So, the amount is $15,000. Maybe it's $15,000. So, in the first year, it's $15,000. Then, in the second year, they spend a third of that amount. So, a third of $15,000.

Wait, hold on, maybe I should write it as $15,000. So, $15,000. Then, a third of that is $15,000 divided by 3. Let me compute that.

So, 15,000 divided by 3. Let me do the division. 15 divided by 3 is 5, so 15,000 divided by 3 is 5,0000. So, $5,000. So, in the first year, they spent $15,000, and in the second year, they spent $5,000.

Therefore, the total amount spent over the two years is $15,000 plus $5,000. Let me add those together. 15,000 plus 5,000 is 20,000. So, the total amount is $20,000.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 15,000 divided by 3 is 5,000. So, 15,000 + 5,000 is 20,000. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. A third of 15,000 is 15,000*(1/3) = 5,000. So, adding 15,000 and 5,000 gives 20,000. Yeah, that makes sense.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by converting the numbers into different forms. Let me see. 15,000 is the same as 15000. So, 15000 divided by 3 is 5000. Then, 15000 + 5000 is 20000. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of units. If I have 15,000 units of something, and I spend a third of that, which is 5,0000 units, so total is 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000. So, same answer.

Wait, but hold on, in the problem statement, it's written as $15000, which is a bit confusing because of the comma. Maybe it's supposed to be $15,000? So, $15,000. Hmm, maybe the comma is a decimal separator, not a thousand separator. So, in some countries, commas are used as decimal points, but in others, they are used as thousand separators. So, in the US, for example, commas are used as thousand separators, so $15,000 would be $15,000, which is $15,000, which is $15,000. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. Let me see. The user wrote: "A company spends $1
