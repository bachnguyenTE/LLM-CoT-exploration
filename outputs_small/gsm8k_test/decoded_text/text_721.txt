Q: Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?

Okay, so Helga is a really fast clog dancer in Slovenia. The question is about how many taps she does in total while dancing. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute while she's holding her arms down. Simultaneously, she taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, when her arms are down, she taps both feet at those rates. Then, when she raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. 

She dances for a total of 5 minutes, and during only 2 of those minutes does she raise her arms. So, that means for 3 minutes, she's tapping both feet at the lower rate, and for 2 minutes, she's tapping both feet at the higher rate.

I need to find the combined total number of taps she does. So, I think I should calculate the taps for each foot separately and then add them together.

Let me start with the taps when her arms are down. She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute. So, in one minute, that's 300 taps. Similarly, she taps her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, in one minute, that's 250 taps.

Therefore, when her arms are down, the total taps per minute would be 300 (right) + 250 (left) = 555 taps per minute.

Since she does this for 3 minutes, the total taps during those 3 minutes would be 555 taps/minute * 3 minutes. Let me calculate that: 555 * 3. Hmm, 500*3 is 1500, and 55*3 is 165, so 1500 + 165 is 1665. So, 1665 taps during the 3 minutes with arms down.

Now, when she raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. So, each foot taps at 200 per minute. Therefore, the total taps per minute when arms are raised is 200 (right) + 200 (left) = 400 taps per minute.

She does this for 2 minutes. So, the total taps during those 2 minutes would be 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes. That's 800 taps.

Now, to find the combined total number of of taps, I need to add the taps from both periods. So, 1665 taps + 800 taps. Let me add those: 1665 + 800. 1600 + 800 is 2400, and 65 + 0 is 65, so total is 2465.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, taps with arms down: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute. For 3 minutes: 550 * 3. 500*3 is 1500, 50*3 is 150, so 1500 + 150 is 1665. That seems right.

Then, taps with arms up: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute. For 2 minutes: 400 *2 = 800. That's correct.

Adding them together: 1665 + 800. Let's do it step by step. 1665 + 800. 1665 + 800 is 2465. Wait, 1665 + 800: 1665 + 800. 1665 + 800. 1665 + 800 is 2465, and then +0 is 2465. Wait, no, 800 is 800, so 1665 + 800 is 2465. Wait, 1665 + 800 is 2465? Wait, 1665 + 800: 1665 + 800 is 2465? Wait, 1665 + 800: 1665 + 800 is 2465? Wait, 1665 + 800
