Q: A builder works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week. If he gets paid $50 every day, how much does he earn if he works for a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many days the builder works in a year. Since the builder works 6 days each week and there are 52 weeks in a year, I'll multiply 6 by 52 to find the total number of workdays in a year.

Next, I'll calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of workdays by the daily pay of $50.

Finally, I'll present the total earnings as the final answer.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of workdays in a year:**
   
   - The builder works **6 days** each week.
   - There are **52 weeks** in a year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total workdays} = 6 \text{ days/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 312 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings for the year:**
   
   - The builder is paid **\$50** every day.
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 312 \text{ days} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$15,600
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$15,\!600}
\]
