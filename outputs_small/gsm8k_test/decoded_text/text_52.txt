Q: Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total weight Uriah needs to remove from his book bag. He needs to remove 15 pounds.

Next, calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he is removing 30 of them. So, the total weight of the comic books is 30 multiplied by 1/4, which equals 7.5 pounds.

Subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight needed to remove to find out how much weight needs to be removed by toys. 15 pounds minus 7.5 pounds equals 7.5 pounds.

Finally, determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining weight. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy. 7.5 pounds divided by 1/2 pound per toy equals 15 toys.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Weight to Remove:**
   \[
   15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the Removed Comic Books:**
   - Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
   - Number of comic books removed: 30
   \[
   30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight Remaining to Remove:**
   \[
   15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Number of Toys Needed to Remove:**
   - Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
   \[
   \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} = 15 \text{ toys}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
