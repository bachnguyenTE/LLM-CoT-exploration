Q: Aiden is making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs for a neighborhood cookout. He adds two tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef he uses. He gets sixteen meatballs from each pound of meat. If he wants to make 80 meatballs for the cookout, how much of his secret seasoning will he need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine how much ground beef is needed to make 80 meatballs. Since each pound of ground beef yields 16 meatballs, divide 80 by 16 to find the required ground beef.

Next, calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the ground beef. Aiden uses two tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, so multiply the amount of ground beef by 2 to find the total tablespoons of seasoning required.

Finally, convert tablespoons to cups if necessary, but since the question asks for tablespoons, the final answer is 32 tablespoons.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   
   Aiden gets **16 meatballs** from each **1 pound** of ground beef. He wants to make **80 meatballs**.

   \[
   \text{Ground Beef Needed} = \frac{\text{Number of Meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per Pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   
   Aiden uses **2 tablespoons** of seasoning for every **1 pound** of ground beef.

   \[
   \text{Total Seasoning} = \text{Ground Beef Needed} \times \text{Seasoning per Pound} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

   However, the question asks for the amount in **cups**. Since **1 cup = 16 tablespoons**, we can convert tablespoons to cups:

   \[
   \text{Total Seasoning in Cups} = \frac{10 \text{ tablespoons}}{16 \text{ tablespoons/cup}} = \frac{5}{8} \text{ cups}
   \]

   But since the problem doesn't specify the unit for the final answer, we'll stick with tablespoons.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{10 \text{ tablespoons}}
\]
