Q: Mr Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. How many mosaic tiles would Mr Boarden need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom, and he needs to figure out how many mosaic tiles he'll require. The problem says that for every square foot, he needs 24 tiles. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me break it down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

First, the bathroom is 36 square feet. That's given. Now, he wants to cover two-thirds of that bathroom with tiles. So, I need to find out what two-thirds of 36 square feet is. Once I have that, I can multiply by 24 to get the number of tiles needed.

Alright, so let me write that down. Two-thirds of 36 square feet. To calculate that, I can do (2/3) * 36. Let me compute that. 36 divided by 3 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 2 is 24. So, two-thirds of 36 square feet is 24 square feet. Wait, that's interesting because the total area is 36, and two-thirds of that is 24. So, he needs to cover 24 square feet with tiles.

Now, each square foot requires 24 tiles. So, if he needs to cover 24 square feet, the number of tiles would be 24 square feet multiplied by 24 tiles per square foot. Let me write that out: 24 * 24.

Hmm, 24 times 24. Let me compute that. 20 times 24 is 480, and 4 times 24 is 96. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 24 times 24 is actually 576. Let me verify that. 24 times 20 is 480, and 24 times 4 is 96, so adding those together, 480 + 96 is 576. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 24 multiplied by 24 is 576. Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake. First, two-thirds of 36 is indeed 24, because 36 divided by 3 is 12, times 2 is 24. Then, 24 square feet times 24 tiles per square foot is 576 tiles. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 24 tiles per square foot, so 24 square feet would need 24*24=576 tiles. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think 576 is the correct number of tiles Mr. Boarden needs.

**Final Answer**
Mr. Boarden would need \boxed{576} mosaic tiles.

Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom with mosaic tiles. 

First, calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, determine the number of mosaic tiles needed for 24 square feet, given that each square foot requires 24 tiles:
\[
24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Thus, Mr. Boarden would need \boxed{576} mosaic tiles.
