Okay, so I have this problem here about Charisma and her walking routine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Charisma works for 8 hours every day. That's straightforward. She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. After 5 days at the office, we need to find out how many minutes she has walked in total.

Alright, let's break this down. Each day, she works for 8 hours. And every hour, she walks for 5 minutes. So, I think I need to calculate how many minutes she walks each day and then multiply that by 5 days.

Let me write that down:

Minutes walked per day = Hours worked per day × Minutes walked per hour

So, plugging in the numbers:

Minutes walked per day = 8 hours × 5 minutes/hour

Hmm, 8 times 5 is 40, right? Wait, 8 times 5 is 40? No, that's not right. 8 times 5 is actually 40? Wait, no, 8 times 5 is 40? Wait, no, 8 times 5 is 40? No, that's not correct. 8 times 5 is 40?
