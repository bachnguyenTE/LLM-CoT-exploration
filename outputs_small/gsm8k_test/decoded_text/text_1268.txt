Q: A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a tower made out of blocks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says: A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know the total number of blocks is 32. The tower is made up of blue, yellow, and red blocks. They tell me there are 4 blue blocks. Then, the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. And the number of red blocks is unknown, so I need to find that.

Let me write down what I know:

- Number of blue blocks = 4
- Number of yellow blocks = 2 × (number of blue blocks)
- Number of red blocks = unknown (let's call it R)
- Total blocks = 32

So, if I can express the number of yellow and red blocks in terms of the blue blocks, I can add them all up and set the equation equal to 32. That should help me find R.

First, let's find the number of yellow blocks. Since it's twice the number of blue blocks, and blue blocks are 4, then yellow blocks would be 2 × 4. Let me calculate that: 2 × 4 is 8. So, there are 8 yellow blocks.

Now, I know the total number of blocks is 32, and I already have 4 blue and 8 yellow. So, the remaining blocks must be red. So, if I subtract the blue and yellow blocks from the total, I should get the number of red blocks.

Let me write that as an equation:

Total blocks = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks

So, 32 = 4 + 8 + R

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me compute 4 + 8 first. 4 plus 8 is 12. So, 32 = 12 + R.

To find R, I can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. So, R = 32 - 12. Let me do that subtraction: 32 minus 12 is 20. So, R is 20.

Wait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, blue blocks: 4. That's given. Yellow blocks: twice as many as blue, so 2×4=8. That seems right. Total blocks: 32. So, blue and yellow together are 4+8=12. So, red blocks must be 32-12=20. That seems correct.

But let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using variables or equations to represent it more formally.

Let me denote:

B = number of of blue blocks = 4

Y = number of yellow blocks = 2 × B = 2×4=8

R = number of red blocks = ?

Total blocks = B + Y + R = 32

So, substituting the known values:

4 + 8 + R = 32

Which simplifies to:

12 + R = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides:

R = 32 - 12 = 20

So, that's the same result as before. So, R is 20.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the problem again. It says twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, if blue is 4, yellow is 8. So, 4 blue, 8 yellow, 20 red. Let me add them up: 4 + 8 is 12, plus 20 is 32. That's correct.

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

Wait, but hold on, 20 is 20? Wait, 20 is 20, not 22. Wait, no, 20 is correct. 4 + 8 is 12, 32 -12 is 20. So, 20 is 20, which is 20. So, 20 is correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "an unknown number of red blocks." So, 20 is 20, which is 20, but in the problem, it's written as 20. Wait, no, 20 is 20, but in the problem, it's written as 20. Wait, no, 20 is 20, which is 20. Wait
