Q: Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.

Okay, so I have this problem here where Dijana and Anis live near a lake and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing. Dijana rowed for the whole day and covered 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. I need to calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Dijana rowed 50 miles on Sunday morning. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana. So, Anis's rowing distance is Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of Dijana's distance. That makes sense because "times more" usually means an increase by that fraction.

So, if Dijana rowed 50 miles, then Anis rowed 50 miles plus 1/5 of 50 miles. Let me write that down:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5) * Dijana's distance

Which is:

Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5)*50

Let me compute that. First, 1/5 of 50 is... 50 divided by 5 is 10. So, 1/5 of 50 is 10. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. 1/5 of 50 is indeed 10 because 50 divided by 5 is 10. So, 50 +10 is 60. So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

So, Dijana rowed 50 miles, Anis rowed 60 miles. The total distance they rowed together is 50 + 60.

Let me add those up. 50 +60 is 110. So, the total distance is 110 miles.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. So, is that 1/5 of Dijana's distance or 1/5 of Anis's distance? Hmm, the wording is "1/5 times more miles than Dijana." So, "times more" usually refers to the original amount, not the increased amount. So, if Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, that would be Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of Dijana's distance, which is what I did earlier.

Alternatively, if it had said "1/5 times more than Anis," that would be different, but it's "1/5 times more than Dijana." So, yes, it's Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of Dijana's distance.

So, Anis rowed 60 miles, Dijana 50, total 110. So, 110 miles is the total.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes, "times more" can be confusing. Let me see. If Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, that is, Anis's rowing is Dijana's rowing plus 1/5 of Dijana's rowing. So, yes, 50 + (1/5)*50 = 50 +10=60. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if it had said "1/5 times as many," that would be 50*(1/5)=10, so Anis would have rowed 50 +10=60. So, same result.

Wait, but let me think about the wording again: "Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana." So, "times more" is a multiplier on the original amount. So, yes, 1/5 times more than Dijana's 50 is 50 + (1/5)*50=60.

So, that seems correct.

Therefore, total distance is 50 +60=110.

Wait, 50 +60 is 110. So, 110 miles.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a calculation error. 50 +60 is 110. 50 +60 is 110. So, yes, 110.

Wait, but 50 +60 is 1
