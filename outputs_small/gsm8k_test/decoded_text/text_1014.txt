Okay, so I have this problem here about Jamaar who loves fresh fruit and went to the store with $10 he earned from mowing lawns. He wants to buy some fruits, and the question is asking how many plums he can buy after he already purchased some other fruits. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out all the information given:

- Total money Jamaar has: $10
- Cost of each fruit:
  - Peaches: $0.50 each
  - Pears: $0.75 each
  - Kiwis: $1.00 each
  - Plums: $0.25 each
- Fruits already purchased:
  - 3 peaches
  - 4 pears
  - 2 kiwis
  - 5 apples

So, the question is asking how many plums he can buy with the remaining money after purchasing these other fruits.

Alright, so I think the first step is to calculate how much money Jamaar has spent on the fruits he already bought. Then, subtract that total from his $10 to find out how much money he has left. Finally, with the remaining money, we can figure out how many plums he can buy.

Let me write down the costs for each fruit:

- Peaches: $0.50 each. He bought 3 of them. So, 3 * $0.50.
- Pears: $0.75 each. He bought 4 of them. So, 4 * $0.75.
- Kiwis: $1.00 each. He bought 2 of them. So, 2 * $1.00.
- Apples: $0.25 each. He bought 5 of them. So, 5 * $0.25.

Let me calculate each of these one by one.

Starting with peaches: 3 peaches at $0.50 each. So, 3 * 0.50. Hmm, 3 times 0.50 is 1.50. So, $1.50 spent on peaches.

Next, pears: 4 pears at $0.75 each. So, 4 * 0.75. Let me compute that. 4 times 0.75 is 3.00. So, $3.000 spent on pears.

Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.00 each. So, 2 * 1.00 is 2.00. So, $2.00 spent on kiwis.

Apples: 5 apples at $0.25 each. So, 5 * 0.25. 5 times 0.25 is 1.25. So, $1.25 spent on apples.

Now, let me add up all these amounts to find the total money spent.

First, add the money spent on peaches and pears: $1.50 + $3.00. That's $4.50.

Then, add the money spent on kiwis: $4.50 + $2.00. That's $6.50.

Next, add the money spent on apples: $6.50 + $1.25. That's $7.75.

So, total money spent on the fruits he already bought is $7.75.

Now, subtract that from his total money to find out how much he has left.

He had $10.00 initially. So, $10.00 - $7.75.

Let me compute that. $10.000 minus $7.75.

First, subtract the dollars: 10 - 7 = 3.

Then, subtract the cents: 0 - 75. Hmm, wait, that can't be right because 0 is less than 75. So, I need to borrow a dollar from the dollars.

So, 10 dollars becomes 9 dollars, and 10 cents becomes 100 cents. Then, subtract 7 dollars and 75 cents.

So, 9 - 7 = 2 dollars.

100 cents - 75 cents = 25 cents.

So, total is $2.25.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Alternatively, I can think of $10.00 minus $7.75.

$7.75 is the same as $7 and 75 cents.

So, subtracting 7 dollars from 10 dollars gives 3 dollars.

Subtracting 75 cents from 100 cents (since 7.7
