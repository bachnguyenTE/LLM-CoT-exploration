Q: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Okay, so I have this problem here about cooking chicken, and I need to figure out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. After that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. I need to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

Hmm, let me parse this carefully. So, the oil starts at 000 degrees, takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees. After that, cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. So, the total time is the time to warm the oil to 300 degrees plus the time to warm it to 400 degrees plus the time to cook the chicken.

Wait, hold on. Is the 40% longer time for heating to 400 degrees, or is it the time from 300 to 400? The problem says "it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees." So, the oil is heating from 300 to 400, which is a 100-degree increase, and it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

So, let me write down the given information:

1. Oil starts at 200 degrees.
2. It takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.
3. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.
4. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

So, the total time is the time to warm to 300 (20 minutes) plus the time to warm to 400 (which is 20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes) plus the time to cook the chicken, which is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm the oil to 400 degrees.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: when it says "it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees," does that mean the time to go from 300 to 400 is 40% longer than the time to go from 200 to 300? Or is it the time to warm the oil to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time to warm it to 300?

I think it's the latter. So, the time to warm to 400 is 40% longer than the time to warm to 300. So, the time to warm to 300 is 20 minutes, so the time to warm to 400 is 20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes.

Let me compute that. 40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. So, the time to warm to 400 is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit short. 20 minutes to warm to 300, then 8 minutes to warm to 400? That would mean the oil is heating up at a rate of 20 minutes for 100 degrees, so 100 degrees in 20 minutes, which is 0.5 degrees per minute. Then, to get to 400, which is 100 degrees more, at 0.5 degrees per minute, that would take 20 minutes. So, 20 minutes to warm to 300, 20 minutes to warm to 400. So, 40% longer than 20 minutes is 28 minutes? Wait, no, 40% longer than 20 minutes is 20 + (0.4*20) = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes. So, that's 28 minutes to warm to 400.

Wait, but 20 minutes to warm to 300, then 28 minutes to warm to 400? That would be 28 minutes total. But 40% longer than 20 minutes is 28 minutes? Wait, no, 40
