Q: Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Elaina's concert. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. She makes this concert twice as long as her usual concerts. Hmm, okay. So if I let the usual concert time be some variable, maybe 'x' minutes, then the final concert would be 2x minutes long. That makes sense because it's twice as long.

Then, at the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. So that adds an extra 15 minutes to the total runtime. Got it. So the total runtime of the final concert is the usual concert time plus twice that time plus the encore. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The problem says the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. So the usual concert is 'x' minutes, so the final concert is 2x minutes. Then, at the end, she performs a 15-minute encore. So the total runtime is 2x plus 15 minutes. And the problem says that the total runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes. So 2x + 15 = 65. 

So, I can set up the equation: 2x + 15 = 65. Then, I can solve for x. Let me do that.

First, subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 65 - 15, which is 50. So 2x = 50. Then, divide both sides by 2: x = 25. So, the usual concert is 25 minutes long.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the usual concert is 25 minutes, then the final concert is twice that, so 50 minutes. Then, adding the 15-minute encore, that's 50 + 15 = 65 minutes. Which matches the given total runtime. So that seems correct.

So, yeah, the usual concert is 25 minutes long.

**Final Answer**
The usual concert runs for \boxed{25} minutes.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 25 minutes? But 25 minutes seems a bit short for a concert. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the equation was 2x +15 =65. So 2x=60, so x=30. Wait, hold on, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, no, wait. Let me go back. The problem says the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. So if the usual concert is x, then the final concert is 2x. Then, she adds a 15-minute encore. So total runtime is 2x +15=65.

So, 2x +15=65. Subtract 15: 2x=50. So x=25. So, the usual concert is 25 minutes. But 25 minutes is 0.4167 hours, which is about 25 minutes. That seems really short for a concert. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?"

So, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so 2x. Then, she adds a 15-minute encore, so total runtime is 2x +15=65. So, 2x=50, so x=25. So, the usual concert is 25 minutes. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe in the problem, the usual concert is 25 minutes, and the final concert is 50 minutes, plus 15 minutes, totaling 65 minutes. That seems correct.

Wait, but 25 minutes is a very short concert. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says: "the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts." So, if her usual concert is x, then the final is 2x. Then, she adds a 15-minute encore. So, total runtime is 2x +15=65. So, 2x=50, so x=25. Wait, no, 2x=50? Wait, 65-15=50, so 2x=50, so
