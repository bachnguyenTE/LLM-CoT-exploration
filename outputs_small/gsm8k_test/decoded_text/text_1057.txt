Q: Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. If they watch movies every weekend, how many movies can they watch in 4 weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jill and her friends watching movies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says they watch 4 movies every Saturday. Hmm, so that's straightforward. Then it mentions they watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday. So, if they watch 4 movies on Saturday, how many on Sunday? Let me calculate that. Half of 4 is 2, right? So, on Sunday, they watch 2 movies.

Now, the question is asking how many movies they can watch in 4 weeks. So, I need to figure out the total number of movies watched over those 4 weekends. Each weekend consists of a Saturday and a Sunday, so that's 2 days. 

Let me break it down. Each Saturday, they watch 4 movies. Each Sunday, they watch 2 movies. So, each weekend, the total number of movies they watch is 4 plus 2. Let me add those up: 4 + 2 equals 6. So, every weekend, they watch 6 movies.

Now, since there are 4 weekends in total, I need to multiply the number of movies per weekend by 4. That would be 6 multiplied by 4. Let me do that multiplication: 6 times 4 is 24. So, altogether, over 4 weeks, they can watch 24 movies.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. On each Saturday, 4 movies, on each Sunday, 2 movies. So, each weekend is 6. Four weekends would be 6 times 4, which is indeed 24. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward once I break it down into weekends and then into individual days. So, I think 24 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \boxed{24}.

Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies compared to Saturday, which is 2 movies. 

Each weekend consists of 2 days (Saturday and Sunday), and the total number of movies watched each weekend is:
\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Over 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched is:
\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weekends} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \boxed{24}.
