Okay, so James has to buy insurance, and he had an accident that made it 60% more than normal. The normal cost is $120 a month. I need to figure out how much he pays a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the normal cost is $120 a month. But since he had an accident, the insurance cost went up by 60%. So, I need to calculate what 60% of $120 is and then add that to the original $120 to get the total monthly cost after the accident.

Let me write that down. 60% of $120 is... well, to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 60% is 0.66 in decimal form. Then, 0.66 multiplied by $120.

Let me do that multiplication. 0.66 * 120. Hmm, 0.66 times 100 is 66, and 0.66 times 20 is 13.2. So, adding those together, 66 + 13.2 is 79.2. So, 60% of $120 is $79.20.

Now, to find the total monthly cost after the accident, I need to add this extra amount to the original normal cost. So, $120 plus $79.20. Let me add those: 120 + 79.20 is 200.20. So, the total monthly cost is $200.20.

Wait, let me double-check that. 60% of 120 is 79.2, so adding that to 120 gives 200.2. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, since the question is asking for the annual cost, I need to multiply the monthly cost by 12, the number of months in a year. So, $200.20 per month times 12 months.

Let me calculate that. 200.20 * 12. Hmm, breaking it down: 200 *122 is 2400, and 0.20 *12 is 0.40. So, adding those together, 2400 + 0.40 is 2400.40.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try another way. 200.20 *12 is 400.40, and then 0.20 *12 is 0.40. So, adding those together, 400.40 + 0.40 is 400.80. Hmm, so that's $400.80.

Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the decimal places. Let me do it more carefully.

200.20 *12. Let's do 200.20 *10 first, which is 2002.00, and then double that, which is 4004.00. Wait, that can't be right because 200.20 *12 is 200.20 * (10 + 2) = 200.20*10 + 200.20*2 = 2002.00 + 400.40 = 2402.40.

Wait, now I'm confused. I think I'm making a mistake in the decimal places. Let me try another approach.

Let me write it out as:

200.20
x 12
--------
First, multiply 200.20 by 2: 200.20 *2 = 400.40
Then, multiply 200.20 by 10 (which is the same as multiplying by 10 and adding a zero at the end): 200.20*10=2002.00
Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 200.20 *10 is 200.20 *10, which is 2002.00.

Wait, no, 200.20 *10 is 2002.00. So, adding 400.40 and 2002.00: 400.40 + 2002.00 = 2
