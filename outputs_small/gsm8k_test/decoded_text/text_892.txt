Q: Ellen is on a diet. She eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, while the yogurt is half the price. How much does Ellen pay for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 for her goods?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which costs $6, the yogurt costs $3.

Next, calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6 and the yogurt costs $3, so together they cost $9.

Ellen also eats two carrots every day. Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \). The total cost for the carrots is \( 2x \).

The total cost for all her daily food is the sum of the cost of the salad, yogurt, and carrots, which is \( 2x + 9 \).

According to the problem, the total cost is $111. Therefore, set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

Let's determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day.

**Given:**
- **Number of carrots eaten per day:** 2
- **Cost of one salad:** \$6
- **Cost of one yogurt:** Half the price of the salad
- **Total cost for all daily food:** \$11

**Step 1: Calculate the Cost of the Yogurt**

Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad:
\[
\text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$6 = \$3
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost of Salad and Yogurt**

\[
\text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \$6 + \$3 = \$9
\]

**Step 3: Determine the Cost of One Carrot**

Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \). Since Ellen eats 2 carrots:
\[
\text{Total cost of carrots} = 2x
\]

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation for Total Daily Cost**

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} + \text{Cost of carrots}
\]
\[
\$11 = \$9 + 2x
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( x \)**

\[
2x = \$11 - \$9
\]
\[
2x = \$2
\]
\[
x = \frac{\$2}{2} = \$1
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$1}
\]
