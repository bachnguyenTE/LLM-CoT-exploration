Q: The highest temperature ever recorded in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature ever recorded in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature recorded in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. What is the average highest temperature of these 3 countries?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the average highest temperature of three countries: Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia. Let me see, the highest temperatures they've ever recorded are -48 degrees Fahrenheit for Southlandia, 21 degrees Fahrenheit for Northlandia, and -3 degrees Fahrenheit for Midlandia. Hmm, I need to find the average of these three temperatures.

Alright, first things first, I remember that to find an average, you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. In this case, there are three countries, so I'll add up their highest temperatures and then divide by 3. That makes sense.

Let me write down the temperatures to make it clearer. Southlandia is -48°F, Northlandia is 21°F, and Midlandia is -3°F. So, I need to add these three together. Let me do the math step by step.

Starting with the first two: -48°F and 21°F. Adding those together, I think it's like subtracting 48 from 21, but since one is negative, it's actually 21 minus 48. Wait, that would be negative, right? So, 21 minus 48 is... let me calculate that. 21 minus 48 is -27. So, the sum of the first two temperatures is -27°F.

Now, I need to add the third temperature, which is -3°F, to this result. So, -27°F plus (-3°F) is... hmm, adding two negative numbers. I think that's like adding their absolute values and then keeping the negative sign. So, 27 plus 3 is 30, and since both are negative, it's -30°F. So, the total sum of all three temperatures is -30°F.

Wait, let me double-check that. Starting with -48, adding 21 gives me -27, then adding -3 gives me -30. Yeah, that seems right. So, the total sum is -30°F.

Now, to find the average, I have to divide this total by the number of countries, which is 3. So, I need to compute -30 divided by 3. Let me do that. 30 divided by 3 is 10, so -30 divided by 3 is -10. So, the average temperature is -10°F.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the addition. Sometimes when dealing with negative numbers, it's easy to slip up. So, let's add them again: -48 + 21. That's like 21 - 48, which is indeed -27. Then, -27 + (-3) is -30. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total is -30.

Divided by 3, that's -10. So, the average is -10°F. Hmm, that seems a bit cold, but considering the temperatures are -48, 21, and -3, the average is indeed going to be somewhere around there. Let me think about it in another way. If I have a temperature that's way below freezing, and another that's above freezing, and another that's below, the average might be pulled down a bit.

So, -48 is quite a bit below freezing, 21 is above, and -3 is just a bit below. So, when I average them, it's going to be somewhere in the negative, but not too far. So, -10°F seems reasonable.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the sum of the temperatures: -48 + 21 + (-3). Let me compute that again. -48 + 21 is -27, then -27 + (-3) is -30. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, -48 + 21 is -47? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 48 minus 21 is 47, so it's -47? Wait, no, hold on, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, 48 minus 21 is 27, so -48 + 21 is -27. Then, -27 + (-3) is -30. So, that's correct. So, the total is -30, not -30. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 48 minus 21 is 27, so -48 + 21 is -27. Then, -27
