Q: Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Maggie's oven. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem says that Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check the numbers again. It says 450, but then the actual is 468. Maybe that's a typo? Or maybe it's supposed to be 450? Because 450 to 468 is a significant difference. Let me assume it's 450 because that makes more sense. So, when she sets it to 450, the actual is 468. 

So, the difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is 468 - 450, which is 13 degrees. So, the oven is over-temperature by 13 degrees. That means it's 13 degrees higher than it should be. 

Now, the problem says that if it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees? So, we need to find the correct temperature that would result in the same percentage error as the 13 degrees error when setting it to 450.

Let me think about how percentage error works. Percentage error is calculated by taking the difference between the measured value and the actual value, dividing by the actual value, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. So, in this case, the percentage error is (468 - 450)/468 * 100. Wait, no, actually, it's (468 - 450)/450 * 100 because the actual temperature is 468, but the measured temperature is 450. So, the error is 13 degrees over 450, which is 13/450 *100. Let me calculate that.

13 divided by 450 is approximately 0.02888..., which is about 2.8888...%. So, the oven is over-temperature by roughly 2.888% when set to 450. 

Now, the problem says that this percentage error will be the same for any recipe. So, if the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the correct temperature that would result in a 2.888...% error. 

Wait, hold on. Is the percentage error based on the actual temperature or the measured temperature? Hmm, in the first case, when she set it to 450, the actual was 468. So, the error was 13 degrees over 468, which is 13/468 *100. Let me calculate that. 13 divided by 468 is approximately 0.02777..., which is about 2.777...%. So, is the percentage error based on the actual temperature or the measured temperature?

Wait, the problem says, "if it's off by the same percentage for any recipe." So, it's the same percentage for any recipe. So, the percentage error is the same regardless of the recipe. So, in the first case, when she set it to 450, the actual was 468, so the error was 13 degrees over 468, which is approximately 2.777%. So, that's the percentage error. 

Therefore, for any recipe, the oven is off by 2.777...% of the actual temperature. So, if the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the correct temperature that would result in a 2.777...% error. 

So, let me denote the correct temperature as T. Then, the percentage error is (Actual - Measured)/Actual *100 = 2.777...%. So, (468 - T)/468 *100 = 2.777...%. Wait, no, hold on. If the oven is over-temperature, then the measured temperature is higher than the actual. So, the error is (Measured - Actual)/Actual *100. So, in the first case, (450 - 468)/468 *100 = (-13)/468 *100 ≈ -2.777...%. So, the percentage error is negative, meaning it's over-temperature.

But the problem says that the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe. So, the percentage
