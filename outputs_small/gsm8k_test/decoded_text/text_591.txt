Q: Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?

Okay, so I have this problem about four dogs sitting in a line, each with different weights. I need to figure out how much the Mastiff weighs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are four dogs: an Affenpinscher, a Dachshund, a Papillon, and a Mastiff. They are sitting in a line, so their weights are related in a sequence. Let me list out the information given:

1. The first dog is the Affenpinscher, and it weighs 10 pounds. Hmm, wait, 10 pounds? That seems a bit light for a dog, but maybe it's a typo? Or maybe it's a reference weight. I'll go with 10 pounds for now.

2. Next to the Affenpinscher is a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, if the Affenpinscher is 10 pounds, the Dachshund must be 2 times that. Let me write that down: Dachshund = 2 * Affenpinscher.

3. Next to the Dachshund is a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon is 1/4 the weight of the Dachshund. I can write that as Papillon = (1/4) * Dachshund.

4. At the end of the line is a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, Mastiff = 44 * Papillon.

Alright, so I can represent each dog's weight in terms of the previous one. Let me assign variables to each to make it clearer.

Let me denote:

- A = Affenpinscher = 10 pounds
- D = Dachshund = 2 * A
- P = Papillon = (1/4) * D
- M = Mastiff = 44 * P

So, starting with A, I can compute D, then P, then M.

Let me compute each step by step.

First, A is given as 10 pounds.

Next, Dachshund D is twice the Affenpinscher. So, D = 2 * A = 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Then, the Papillon P is one-fourth the Dachshund. So, P = (1/4) * D = (1/4) * 20. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, P = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff M is 44 times the Papillon. So, M = 44 * P = 44 * 5. Let me compute that: 44 * 5 is 220. So, M = 220 pounds.

Wait, 220 pounds? That seems quite heavy for a Mastiff. I mean, I know that generally, Mastiffs can weigh up to 200 pounds, but maybe this is a hypothetical scenario or maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me double-check each step.

1. Affenpinscher is 10 pounds. That's correct.

2. Dachshund is twice that, so 20 pounds. That seems right.

3. Papillon is one-fourth of the Dachshund. So, 20 divided by 4 is 5. That's correct.

4. Mastiff is 44 times the Papillon. So, 5 times 44 is 220. Wait, 5*44 is 220, right? Because 5*40 is 200, and 5*4 is 20, so 200+20=220. So, 220 pounds.

Hmm, so according to the calculations, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds. But I wonder if that's correct. Maybe the problem is just using these numbers as given, regardless of real-world facts.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room. The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds. Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon."

So, the first dog is 10 pounds. Second is twice that, so 20. Third is one-fourth of the second, so
