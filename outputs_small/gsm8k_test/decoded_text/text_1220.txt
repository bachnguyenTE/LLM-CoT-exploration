Q: Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. How long is the longer piece?

Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long, and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is four times longer than the shorter piece. Hmm, I need to figure out how long the longer piece is. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the problem. There's a board that's 40 feet in total length. When Ian makes a cut, he'll end up with two separate pieces. One piece is longer than the other, and the longer one is four times as long as the shorter one. So, if I can figure out the lengths of both pieces, I can find the answer.

Let me assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is, let's see, 'x' feet. Then, since the longer piece is four times as long, its length would be '4x' feet. That makes sense because if the shorter piece is x, multiplying it by 4 gives the longer piece.

Now, the total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces. So, the shorter piece plus the longer piece should equal 40 feet. In equation form, that would be:

x + 4x = 40

Wait, hold on, 40? That doesn't look right. It should be 40, right? Because the board is 40 feet long. So, the equation should be:

x + 4x = 40

Okay, that makes more sense. So, combining like terms, x + 4x is 5x. So, 5x = 40.

To find x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, x = 40 / 5. Let me calculate that. 40 divided by 5 is 8. So, x is 8 feet. That means the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

But wait, the longer piece is four times that, so 4 times 8 is 32. So, the longer piece is 32 feet. Let me check if that adds up to 40 feet. 8 plus 32 is 40. Yep, that works.

So, the longer piece is 32 feet. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I set the shorter piece as x, longer as 4x, added them together to get 5x, set that equal to 40, solved for x as 8, then multiplied by 4 to get 32. Checked the total, it adds up. Seems solid.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward algebra problem where setting up the variables correctly and solving the equation was key. I don't see any other way to approach this problem, so I think 32 feet is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The longer piece is \boxed{32} feet long.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He makes a cut to create two pieces, where the longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece. Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces:

\[
x + 4x = 40
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
5x = 40
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Thus, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, and the length of the longer piece is:

\[
4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
\]

The longer piece is \boxed{32} feet long.
