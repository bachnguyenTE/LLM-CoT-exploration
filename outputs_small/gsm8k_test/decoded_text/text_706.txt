Q: The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?

Okay, so I have this problem where the local firefighters are doing a "fill the boot" fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they've already raised $2100. I need to figure out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal, assuming they raise the same amount every hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. They have a total goal of $6300. After 3 hours, they've raised $2100. So, they've already done 3 hours and have $2100. Now, they want to know how many more hours they need to work to reach the total goal of $6300. So, essentially, they need to raise the remaining amount after the first 3 hours.

Let me write down the given information:

- Total goal: $6300
- Amount raised after 3 hours: $2100
- Hours already worked: 3
- Rate of fundraising: equal amount per hour

So, the first thing I should do is find out how much more money they need to raise. That would be the total goal minus the amount already raised. Let me calculate that.

Remaining amount = Total goal - Amount raised
Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100

Hmm, let me subtract these numbers. 6300 minus 2100. Let me do this step by step.

6300 minus 2000 is 4300, and then minus 100 more is 4200. So, the remaining amount is $4200.

Okay, so they need to raise another $4200. Now, since they're raising the same amount every hour, I can find out how many more hours they need to work by dividing the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour.

Let me denote the amount raised per hour as 'r'. So, r = $2100 / 3 hours.

Calculating that, 2100 divided by 3. Let me do that division.

3 goes into 2 once, with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 1, making it 11. 3 goes into 11 three times, which is 9, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 3 goes into 20 six times, which is 18, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the next 0, making it 20. 3 goes into 20 six times again, with a remainder of 2. Wait, this seems like a repeating decimal.

Wait, maybe I should do this more carefully.

2100 divided by 3:

3 into 2 is 0, so we consider 21. 3 into 21 is 7. 7 times 3 is 21, subtract, remainder 0. Bring down the next 1. 3 into 1 is 0, so we write 0. Bring down the next 0. 3 into 10 is 3, 3 times 3 is 9, remainder 1. Bring down the next 0. 3 into 10 is 3 again, 3 times 3 is 9, remainder 1. So, it's 703.333... Wait, that can't be right because 3 times 703.333 is 2100.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me try again.

Wait, 2100 divided by 3.

3 into 2 is 0, so we take 21. 3 into 21 is 7, because 7*3 is 21. Subtract, remainder 0. Bring down the 1, making it 01. 3 into 1 is 0, so we write 0. Bring down the 0, making it 10. 3 into 10 is 3, 3*3 is 9, remainder 1. Bring down the next 0, making it 10. 3 into 10 is 3 again, 3*3 is 9, remainder 1. So, it's 703.333... So, approximately 703.33 per hour.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check: 703.33 times 3 is 2109.99, which is approximately 2110, but the amount raised was 2100. So, maybe I should have considered it as 70
