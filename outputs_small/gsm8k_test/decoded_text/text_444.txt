Q: Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Movie C was 1.25 hours. How many minutes long was Movie A?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three movies: A, B, and C. The question is asking how long Movie A is in minutes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Hmm, okay, so if I let the length of Movie A be some variable, say A, then Movie B must be four times that. So, A = (1/4) * B. That makes sense.

Next, it mentions that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, if I let the length of Movie C be C, then Movie B is C plus 5 minutes. So, B = C + 5. Got that.

Then, it says Movie C was 1.25 hours. Wait, that's in hours, but the question is asking for the length in minutes. So, I need to convert hours to minutes. I remember that 1 hour is 600 minutes, so 1.25 hours would be 1.25 * 600. Let me calculate that.

1.25 multiplied by 600. Hmm, 1 times 600 is 660, and 0.25 times 660 is... let me see, 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 660 is 165. So, 660 + 165 is 825. So, Movie C is 825 minutes long. Okay, that's clear.

Now, since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, and Movie C is 825 minutes, then Movie B must be 825 + 5, which is 830 minutes. So, B is 830 minutes.

Now, going back to the first part, Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, A = (1/4) * B. Since B is 830 minutes, then A is 830 divided by 4. Let me do that division.

830 divided by 4. Let's see, 4 goes into 8 twice, so 2. Then, 4 goes into 3 zero times, so we write a decimal point and bring down the 0. 4 goes into 30 seven times (because 4*7=28), with a remainder of 2. Then, bring down the next 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So, putting it all together, 830 divided by 4 is 207.5. So, Movie A is 207.5 minutes long.

Wait, that seems a bit strange because usually, movie lengths are whole numbers, but maybe it's okay. Or perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, converting 1.25 hours to minutes: 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours is 1 hour plus 0.25 hours. 0.25 hours is 15 minutes, so 60 + 15 is 75 minutes. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. 1.25 hours is actually 75 minutes, not 825. Because 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 0.25 hours is 15 minutes, so 60 + 15 is 75. So, I think I messed up the conversion earlier.

So, if Movie C is 1.25 hours, that's 75 minutes. Then, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so 75 + 5 is 80 minutes. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, now I'm confused because I thought 1.25 hours is 825 minutes, but actually, it's 75 minutes. So, which one is correct?

Let me think. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours is 1 hour plus 0.25 hours. 0.25 hours is 15 minutes, so 600 + 15 is 75 minutes. So, 1.25 hours is 75 minutes. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 1.25 hours is 825 minutes. That was incorrect. It's actually 75 minutes.

So, correcting that, Movie C is 75 minutes. Then, Movie B is 5 minutes longer, so 75 + 5 is 80 minutes. So, Movie B is 80 minutes.

Then,
