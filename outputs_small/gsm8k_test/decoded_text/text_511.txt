Q: Gerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of $100. How much does he have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Gerald earns in a week. Since he is paid $30 every day and worked for 7 days, I'll multiply 30 by 7 to find his total earnings.

Next, I'll subtract his total spending of $100 from his weekly earnings to find out how much money he has left.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Gerald's weekly earnings:**
   
   Gerald is paid **\$30** every day.
   
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings} = 30 \times 7 = 210
   \]

2. **Determine the amount spent:**
   
   Gerald spent a total of **\$100**.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Spent} = 100
   \]

3. **Find out how much money Gerald has left:**
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \text{Weekly Earnings} - \text{Amount Spent} = 210 - 100 = 110
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
