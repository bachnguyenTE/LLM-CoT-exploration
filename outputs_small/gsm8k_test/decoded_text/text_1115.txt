Q: Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total amount Anna initially had, which is $16.

Subtract the amount she has already spent, which is $4, to find out how much she has left: $16.

Anna has $2 left in her budget after her purchases.

Subtract the remaining $2 from the $6 she has left to find out how much she spent on the books: $4.

Since she bought 2 books that cost the same amount, divide the total amount spent on the books by 2 to find the cost per book: $2.

Therefore, each book costs $2.

**Solution:**

Anna has a total budget of \$16 after spending \$4. She has \$2 left in her budget, which means she spent:

\[
\$6 - \$2 = \$4
\]

She bought 2 books that cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:

\[
\frac{\$4}{2} = \$2
\]

**Answer:**  
Each book costs \(\boxed{2}\) dollars.
