Q: Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?

Okay, so I have this problem about Tanya making a salt scrub. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says she uses salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She fills a 10-ounce jar each time, so the total amount of all these ingredients adds up to 10 ounces. 

First, let me list out all the ingredients and the relationships between them:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. So, if I let the amount of citrus zest be, say, C ounces, then the amount of fragrance is also C ounces.

2. She uses twice as much oil as salt. So, if I let the amount of salt be S ounces, then the amount of oil is 2S ounces.

3. She uses twice as much salt as zest. So, if the amount of citrus zest is C ounces, then the amount of salt is 2C ounces.

Wait, hold on, that might be a bit confusing. Let me make sure I get the relationships straight.

She uses twice as much salt as zest. So, salt = 2 * zest. And she uses twice as much oil as salt, so oil = 2 * salt. So, if I let the amount of zest be Z ounces, then salt is 2Z, and oil is 2*(2Z) = 4Z.

Also, she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. So, if zest is Z, then fragrance is also Z.

So, now I have all the ingredients in terms of Z:

- Zest (C) = Z
- Flavour (F) = Z
- Salt (S) = 2Z
- Oil (O) = 4Z
- Sugar (G) = ?

Wait, the problem doesn't mention sugar in the relationships, but it does say she uses enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. So, the total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces.

So, let's write that equation:

Zest + Flavour + Salt + Oil + Sugar = 10 ounces.

Substituting the variables:

Z + Z + 2Z + 4Z + Sugar = 10.

Let me compute the coefficients:

1Z (Zest) + 1Z (Flavour) + 2Z (Salt) + 4Z (Oil) + Sugar = 10 (Sugar)

So, adding up the coefficients:

1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 (for Sugar) = 9.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check:

Zest: 1Z

Flavour: 1Z

Salt: 2Z

Oil: 4Z

Sugar: 1S

So, total is 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 9Z + Sugar = 10 ounces.

Wait, so 9Z + Sugar = 10.

But I don't know what Sugar is in terms of Z. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the relationship between sugar and the other ingredients. It only mentions salt and zest, and citrus zest and fragrance.

So, maybe I need to express Sugar in terms of Z as well.

Wait, the problem doesn't give any direct relationship between sugar and the other ingredients. So, perhaps I need to assume that Sugar is a separate variable, but since the problem is asking for the amount of oil, which is 4Z, maybe I can express everything in terms of Z and solve for Z, then find the amount of oil.

But I don't have an equation for Sugar. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. She uses twice as much oil as salt. She uses twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?

So, the key relationships are:

1. C = F (citrus zest equals fragrance)
2. O = 2S (oil is twice salt)
3. S = 2C (salt is twice zest)
4. Total = 10 ounces.

So, let's express everything in terms of C.

From point 3: S = 2C.

From point 1: F = C.

From point 2: O = 2S = 2*(2C) = 4C.

So, now, the total is:

C (citrus) + C (flavour) + 2C (salt) + 4C (oil) + G (sugar) = 10 ounces.

So, adding up the coefficients:

1C + 1C + 2C + 4C + G = 10.

So, 8C + G = 10.
