Q: Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Okay, so I have this problem about Conor and the people he sees at the beach each day. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. 

Conor lives near a beach and likes to go there every day for fun. One particular week, he saw 50 people on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were there than on the first day. On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day. For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day. I need to calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Alright, so let's break this down day by day.

**First Day:**
He saw 50 people. That's straightforward.

**Second Day:**
It says there were 20 more people than the first day. So, if the first day was 50, the second day would be 50 + 20. Let me calculate that.

50 + 20 = 70. So, on the second day, Conor saw 70 people.

**Third Day:**
This is a bit trickier. It says the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. Hmm, so twice the second day's count. Since the second day was 70, twice that would be 70 * 2.

70 * 2 = 140. So, on the third day, Conor saw 140 people.

Now, the rest of the week. Wait, the problem says "the rest of the week." So, assuming a week has 7 days, so if we've accounted for the first three days, that leaves 4 more days (since 7 - 3 = 4). 

It also says Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. So, for those 4 days, we need to calculate the total number of people he saw each day and then add that to the previous days.

Let me write down the days:

1. Day 1: 50
2. Day 2: 70
3. Day 3: 140
4. Day 4: 60
5. Day 5: 60
6. Day 6: 60
7. Day 7: 60

Wait, hold on. The problem says "the rest of the week," which is 4 days, each with an average of 60. So, I think that's correct.

So, let me calculate the total for the first three days and then add the total for the remaining four days.

First, let's add up the first three days:

Day 1: 50

Day 2: 70

Day 3: 140

Total for first three days: 50 + 70 + 140.

Let me compute that:

50 + 70 = 120

120 + 140 = 260

So, 260 people over the first three days.

Now, for the remaining four days, each day has an average of 60. So, total for four days is 60 * 4.

60 * 4 = 240

So, 240 people over the next four days.

Now, to find the total for the entire week, we add the first three days and the next four days.

260 + 240 = ?

Let me compute that:

260 + 240.

200 + 200 = 400

60 + 40 = 106

So, 400 + 106 = 506

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.

First three days:

50 + 70 + 140.

50 + 70 is 126, plus 140 is 266. That's correct.

Next four days: 60 *4 = 240. Correct.

266 + 240.

200 + 200 = 400

60 + 40 = 100

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 266 + 240 is 506, but 266 + 240 is 506? Wait, 266 + 240 is 506? Let me add 266 + 240.
