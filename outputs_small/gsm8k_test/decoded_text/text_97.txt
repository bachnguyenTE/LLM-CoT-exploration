Q: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Freda cooking canned tomatoes into sauce. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Hmm, so if she starts with a certain amount of tomatoes, after cooking, only half of that volume remains as sauce. That makes sense because cooking usually reduces the volume, right?

Next, it mentions that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes she uses contains three tomatoes. So, for every can she uses, she has 16 ounces of tomatoes, and that's equivalent to 3 tomatoes. I need to figure out how many tomatoes she used in her last batch, which resulted in 32 ounces of sauce.

Let me break this down. If each can gives her 16 ounces of tomatoes, and each can has 3 tomatoes, then each can gives her 16 ounces of sauce after cooking, because she loses half the volume. Wait, is that right? If she starts with 16 ounces of tomatoes, and she loses half, that would be 3 ounces of sauce. So, each can gives her 3 ounces of sauce.

But in the problem, she made 32 ounces of sauce. So, if each can gives her 3 ounces, how many cans did she use? Let me calculate that. 32 ounces divided by 3 ounces per can is approximately 10.666... cans. Hmm, but she can't use a fraction of a can, right? So, maybe she used 11 cans? But wait, let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see. Each can gives her 3 ounces of sauce. So, 32 ounces divided by 3 ounces per can is 32/3, which is about 10 and 2/3 cans. But since she can't use a third of a can, she must have used 11 full can, which gives her 3 ounces, and then she needs more sauce. But wait, 11 can gives 3 ounces, so 32 ounces would require more than 11 cans. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between the volume of tomatoes and the volume of sauce. Each can gives her 16 ounces of tomatoes, but she loses half the volume when cooking, so she gets 8 ounces of sauce per can. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. The problem says that when she cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, if she starts with a can of 16 ounces of tomatoes, after cooking, she has 8 ounces of sauce. So, each can gives her 8 ounces of sauce.

But then, each can contains 3 tomatoes, so each can gives her 8 ounces of sauce. So, if she made 32 ounces of sauce, how many cans did she use? 32 divided by 8 is 4. So, she used 4 cans. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 cans would be 12 tomatoes.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. Each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes, but after cooking, it's 8 ounces of sauce. So, each can gives 8 ounces of sauce. So, 32 ounces of sauce divided by 8 ounces per can is 4 cans. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 cans times 3 tomatoes is 12 tomatoes.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes, which becomes 8 ounces of sauce. So, 16 ounces of tomatoes = 8 ounces of sauce. So, 1 ounce of sauce is 2 ounces of tomatoes. So, 32 ounces of sauce would be 64 ounces of tomatoes. But each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes, so 64 divided by 6 is approximately 10.666... cans. But that can't be right because you can't use a fraction of a can.

Wait, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe each can gives her 3 ounces of sauce, not 8 ounces. Let me go back to the problem.

The problem says: "each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes." So, each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes, which is 3 tomatoes. So, each can gives her 16 ounces of tomatoes, which is 3 tomatoes. But when she cooks them, she loses half the volume. So, 16 ounces of tomatoes becomes 8 ounces of sauce. So, each can gives her 8 ounces of sauce.

But then, if each can gives her
