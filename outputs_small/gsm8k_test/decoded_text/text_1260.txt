Q: Jade bought a new cell phone with an incredible camera, so she spent all week taking pictures of her daily life. At the end of the week, she had taken 210 photos. She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jade and her Instagram photos. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Jade bought a new cell phone with an incredible camera and spent a whole week taking pictures. At the end of the week, she had taken 210 photos. Hmm, wait, the original problem says 210, but in the answer, it's written as 210. Maybe that's a typo? I'll go with 210 since that's what the problem states.

So, she wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. She uploads 7 photos in one batch, and she does 6 batches each day. The question is, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?

Alright, let's break this down. First, she has 210 photos. She uploads 7 photos each batch, and each day she does 6 batches. So, I need to figure out how many batches she does in a day, then how many days it takes to upload all 210 photos.

Let me write this out:

Total photos = 210

Photos per batch = 7

Batches per day = 6

So, first, how many photos does she upload each day? That would be batches per day multiplied by photos per batch. So, 6 batches times 7 photos per batch.

Let me calculate that: 6 * 7 = 42. So, she uploads 42 photos each day.

Now, she has 210 photos in total. If she uploads 42 each day, how many days will it take her to upload all of them?

To find the number of days, I can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded each day. So, 210 divided by 42.

Let me do that division: 210 ÷ 42.

Hmm, 42 goes into 210 how many times? Let me see. 42 times 5 is 210, right? Because 42*5 is 210. So, 42*5=210.

Wait, so 210 divided by 42 is 5. So, she needs 5 days to upload all her photos.

But wait, let me double-check that. If she uploads 42 photos each day, then over 5 days, that's 42*5=210. Yep, that adds up.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculations. So, 210 photos, 7 per batch, 6 batches per day.

So, batches per day: 6*7=42. Correct.

Total days: 210/42=5. Correct.

Wait, but 210 divided by 42 is 5? Let me do the division again to be sure.

42 goes into 210. 42*5=210, so yes, 5 days.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 210 divided by 42. Let me see, 42*5=210, so yes, 5 days.

Alternatively, if I do 210 ÷ 42, that's the same as 210 ÷ (6*7). So, 210 ÷ 6 is 35, and then 35 ÷7 is 5. So, same result.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think about the problem again. She uploads 7 photos in one batch, and 6 batches each day. So, each day, she uploads 42 photos. So, 210 photos divided by 42 per day is 5 days.

But wait, 42*5 is 210, so that's correct.

But hold on, 210 is the total number of photos. So, 210 divided by 42 is 5. So, 5 days.

But wait, 42*5 is 210, so that's correct.

Wait, but 210 is the total number of photos, so 5 days is correct.

Wait, but 210 is the number of photos, so 210 divided by 42 is 5. So, 5 days.

Wait, but 42*5 is 210, so that's correct.

Wait, but 42*5 is 210, so 5 days.

Wait, but 42*5 is 210? Wait, 42*5 is 210? Wait, 42*5
