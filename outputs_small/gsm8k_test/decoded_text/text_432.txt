Q: Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?

Okay, so I have this problem here about four princes and the number of dragons they each slew. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem says Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his sword. That seems straightforward. So, Thaddeus: 100 dragons. Got that.

Next, Prince Arthur uses a spear and sries three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Hmm, okay. So, if Thaddeus sries 100 dragons, Arthur sries three quarters of that. Let me write that down. Three quarters of 100. So, 3/4 * 100. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 4 is 25, right? Because 4 times 25 is 100. So, 3 times 25 is 75. So, Arthur sries 75 dragons. Okay, that makes sense.

Then, Prince Walter uses a rusty iron axe and sries twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, if Arthur sries 75 dragons, Walter sries twice that. So, 2 * 75. Let me do that. 2 times 70 is 140, and 2 times 5 is 10, so 140 + 10 is 150. So, Walter sries 150 dragons. Got it.

Now, Prince Bruce forgets his sword at home and sries one-fifth as many dragons as Walter. So, one-fifth of 150. Let me calculate that. 150 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 15 three times, so 5 goes into 150 thirty times. So, 150 divided by 5 is 30. So, Bruce sries 30 dragons. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

So, Walter sries twice as Arthur, who sries three quarters of Thaddeus. Thaddeus is 100, so three quarters is 75. Then Walter is twice that, so 150. Then Bruce is one-fifth of Walter, so 150 divided by 5 is 30. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Thaddeus: 100, Arthur: 75, Walter: 150, Bruce: 30. So, 100, 75, 150, 30. That seems like a logical progression. Thaddeus is the one who sries the most, then Arthur, then Walter, then Bruce. So, the numbers are decreasing by a factor each time.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus." So, if Thaddeus is 100, three quarters is 75. That's correct. Then, "twice as many as Prince Arthur." So, 75 times 2 is 150. Then, "one-fifth as many as Prince Walter." So, 150 divided by 5 is 30. So, yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just go through each step again.

1. Thaddeus: 100 dragons.
2. Arthur: 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Walter: 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Bruce: 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Yes, that all adds up. So, the answer should be 30 dragons. So, Prince Bruce sries 30 dragons.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure that the problem is asking for the number of dragons sried by Bruce, which is 30. So, the answer is 30. So, in the box, it should be \boxed{30}.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, sometimes in word problems, the order of operations can be tricky. But in this case, it's pretty straightforward: each one is a multiple of the previous. Thaddeus is 100, Arthur is 3/4 of that, Walter is twice Arthur, and Bruce is 1/5 of Walter. So, no, I don't think there's any ambiguity here.

Alternatively, if I had to represent this with variables, let me try that. Let T be the number of
