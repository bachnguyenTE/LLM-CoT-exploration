Q: Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for all 27 students. Since each student gets 2 glue sticks, I'll multiply 27 by 2.

27 students × 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks.

Next, I need to figure out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are needed to provide at least 54 glue sticks. I'll divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack.

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs.

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, I'll round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Finally, I'll verify that 7 packs provide enough glue sticks. 7 packs × 8 glue sticks per pack = 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 needed, ensuring there are some extra glue sticks left over.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of glue sticks needed:**
   
   - Number of students: 27
   - Glue sticks per student: 2
   
   \[
   \text{Total glue sticks needed} = 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of packs required:**
   
   - Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs}
   \]
   
   Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we round up to the next whole number:
   
   \[
   \text{Packs to buy} = 7
   \]

3. **Verify the total glue sticks provided:**
   
   \[
   7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks}
   \]
   
   This is more than the 54 needed, ensuring there are some extra glue sticks left over.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{7}
\]
