Okay, so I have this problem here where a group of girls is trying to raise money for a carnival. The question is asking how much money they all raised in total. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says:

"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?"

Wait, hold on, the problem says "Alexandra, who raises $430." Hmm, that seems like a typo. It should probably be $430, right? Because $430 is a bit odd. Maybe it's supposed to be $430? Or maybe it's a different number. Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back, it says: "Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300." Hmm, okay, so maybe it's $430 and $400? That would make more sense. So, I think it's a typo, and it should be $430 and $400. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, let's list out the information given:

1. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
2. Alexandra raises $430.
3. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.
4. Sarah raises $300.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. If Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, then Maryam would be 300 + 400 = $700. But that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.

Wait, the problem says: "Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300." So, Sarah raises $300, and Maryam raises $400 more than that. So, Maryam raises 300 + 400 = $700. That seems high, but maybe it's correct.

Similarly, Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Alexandra raises $430, and Kim raises 430 + 320 = $750.

So, let me list all the amounts:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot of money. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says:

"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300."

So, that would mean:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: 430 + 320 = $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: 300 + 400 = $700

So, total amounts:

Alexandra: $430

Kim: $750

Sarah: $300

Maryam: $700

Wait, hold on, that adds up to 430 + 750 + 300 + 700. Let me compute that.

430 + 750 is 1180.

300 + 700 is 1000.

1180 + 1000 is 2180.

So, total is $2180.

But wait, that seems low for a carnival. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300."

Wait, so maybe the numbers are:

Alexandra: $430

Kim: 430 + 320 = 750

Sarah: 300

Maryam: 300 + 400 = 700

So, total is 430 + 750 + 300 + 700.

Wait, 430 + 750 is 1185, and 300 + 700 is 1000, so total is 2185.

Wait, but 430 + 750 is 1180, and 30
