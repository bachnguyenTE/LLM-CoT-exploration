Q: Doctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday. He is spending nine hours at the clinic where he works that day. He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records on Monday. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Doctor Jones is working a total of nine hours at the clinic. He has two main activities that take time: rounds to check inpatients and ten appointments. Each inpatient visit takes twenty minutes, and each appointment takes thirty minutes. He has nine inpatients, and we need to find out how much time he has left for updating his records.

Alright, let's list out the information:

- Total time available: 9 hours
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Number of appointments: 10

So, the first thing I need to do is calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on the inpatient rounds and the total time he spends on all the appointments. Then, I can subtract both of these from the total available time to find out how much time is left for updating his records.

Let me start with the inpatient rounds. Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, which is 20 minutes. He has 9 inpatients. So, the total time for inpatient rounds is 9 multiplied by 20 minutes.

Calculating that: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Wait, hold on, 9 times 20 is 180? Hmm, 20 minutes per inpatient, 9 inpatients. So, 20 * 9 is 180 minutes. That seems right.

Now, moving on to the appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and he has 10 of them. So, the total time for appointments is 10 multiplied by 30 minutes.

Calculating that: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Okay, so the total time spent on inpatient rounds is 180 minutes, and the total time spent on appointments is 300 minutes.

Now, let's add these two times together to find the total time spent on all activities.

Total time spent = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Wait, 180 + 300 is 480 minutes. Hmm, 480 minutes. But the total time available is 9 hours, which is 540 minutes because 9 * 60 = 540.

So, subtracting the total time spent from the total time available will give the remaining time for updating records.

Time left = Total time available - Total time spent
Time left = 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes.

60 minutes is equal to 1 hour. So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes each = 180 minutes. That seems correct.

Appointments:10 appointments *30 minutes each = 300 minutes. That also seems correct.

Total time spent:180 + 330 = 510 minutes? Wait, hold on, 180 + 300 is 480 minutes, not 510. Wait, 180 + 300 is 480, not 510. So, 480 minutes is the total time spent.

Total time available is 9 hours, which is 540 minutes. So, 540 - 480 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but 180 + 300 is 480, not 510. So, 540 - 480 is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So, yes, 1 hour.

Wait, but 180 + 300 is 480, not 510. So, 540 - 480 is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 180 + 300 is 480? Wait, 180 + 300 is 480? Wait, 180 + 300: 180 + 300 is 480, yes. So, 480 minutes is 8 hours. Wait, no, 480 minutes is 8 hours? Wait, no, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 480 minutes is
