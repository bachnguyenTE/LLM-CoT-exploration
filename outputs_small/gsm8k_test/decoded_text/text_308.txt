Q: A tub of ice cream costing $13 is now sold at $11. A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. How much will you save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk?

Okay, so I have this problem here about buying ice cream and milk, and I need to figure out how much I'll save if I buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says a tub of ice cream costs $13, but now it's sold at $11. So, that means the price has been discounted. Then, a packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. Hmm, so the milk is discounted by $0.5 per packet. I need to find out how much I'll save if I buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

Alright, so I think I need to calculate the savings for each item separately and then add them up. Let me start with the ice cream.

The original price of one tub is $13, and it's now $11. So, the discount per tub is $13 minus $11, which is $2. So, each tub saves me $2. If I'm buying 2 tubs, then the total savings from the ice cream would be 2 times $2, which is $4. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to the milk. Each packet is sold at a discount of $0.5. So, the original price of a packet isn't given, but since it's a discount, I can assume that the original price must be more than $0.5. But wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the original price of a packet of milk. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says a packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5. Hmm, so maybe the discount is $0.5 per packet, but the original price isn't mentioned. That's a bit of a problem because without knowing the original price, I can't calculate the exact savings. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5." Hmm, so maybe the discount is $0.5 per packet, but the original price is not given. So, perhaps the original price is the same as the discounted price? Or maybe the original price is $11? Wait, no, the ice cream is $11, but the milk is discounted by $0.5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the original price of the milk is the same as the discounted price? Or maybe the discount is $0.5 off the original price. But since the original price isn't given, I can't figure out the exact amount saved per packet. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: "A packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5." So, the discount is $0.5, but the original price isn't given. So, perhaps the original price is the same as the discounted price? Or maybe the original price is $11? Wait, no, the ice cream is $11, but the milk is discounted by $0.5. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the original price of the milk is $11? But that seems odd because the ice cream is $13. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only about the ice cream and the milk, and the discount on the milk is $0.5 per packet, but the original price isn't given. So, maybe I can't calculate the exact savings for the milk. That can't be right because the problem is asking for the total savings, so I must have missed something.

Wait, maybe the original price of the milk is the same as the discounted price? So, if the discounted price is $0.5, then the original price would be $1.00? That seems too low. Or maybe the original price is $11, and the discount is $0.5, so the discounted price is $10.50? Hmm, but the problem says the discount is $0.5, not $0.50.

Wait, maybe the discount is $0.5 per packet, so the original price is $11, and the discounted price is $10.50? But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the original price is $11, and the discount is $0.5, so the discounted price is $10.50. But again, the problem says the discount is $0.5, not $0.50.

Wait, maybe the discount is $0.5 per packet, so the original price is $11, and the discounted price is $0.5. But that doesn't make
