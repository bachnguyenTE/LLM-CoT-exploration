Q: Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so his daily earnings are 10 hours multiplied by $10 per hour, which equals $100 per day.

Next, I'll determine his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by 5 days, resulting in $500 per week.

Since April has 30 days, Watson worked 30 days in April. Multiplying his weekly earnings by 30 gives him $15,000 for the week.

Additionally, because the company performed very well for the entire month, Watson receives a $300 bonus. Adding this to his weekly earnings, Watson's total earnings for April are $15,300.

**Solution:**

Let's break down Watson's earnings step by step.

1. **Calculate Daily Earnings:**
   - **Hours Worked per Day:** 10 hours
   - **Hourly Wage:** \$10 per hour
   - **Daily Earnings:** 
     \[
     10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day}
     \]

2. **Calculate Weekly Earnings:**
   - **Days Worked per Week:** 5 days
   - **Weekly Earnings:**
     \[
     5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week}
     \]

3. **Calculate Earnings for April:**
   - **Days in April:** 30 days
   - **Total Weekly Earnings for April:**
     \[
     30 \text{ weeks} \times \$500/\text{week} = \$15,000
     \]

4. **Add the Bonus:**
   - **Bonus for April:** \$300
   - **Total Earnings for April:**
     \[
     \$15,000 + \$300 = \$15,300
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15300}
\]
