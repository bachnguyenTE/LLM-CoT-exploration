Q: Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. The question is asking how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he decided not to buy the headphone set. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Tom bought two items: a CD and a headphone set. The total amount he spent was $48. The CD cost $4. So, I think I can find out how much the headphone set cost by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = Cost of CD + Cost of headphone set

So, $48 = $4 + Cost of headphone set.

To find the cost of the headphone set, I can subtract $4 from $48.

$48 - $4 = $44.

So, the headphone set costs $44. Got that.

Now, the question is asking how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set. So, if he doesn't buy the headphone set, he can only buy CDs. Since each CD costs $4, I need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the $48 he spent on both items.

Wait, hold on. If he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have only spent $48 on CDs. So, how many CDs is that?

Number of CDs = Total amount / Cost per CD

So, that would be $48 / $4.

Let me calculate that: 48 divided by 4 is 12. So, he could have bought 12 CDs if he didn't buy the headphone set.

But wait, hold on again. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says he bought a CD and a headphone set, which together cost $48. So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have only spent $48 on CDs. So, the number of CDs he could buy without the headphone set is 12.

But the question is asking how many more CDs he would have been able to buy. So, originally, he bought both a CD and a headphone set, which cost $48 in total. So, if he had bought only CDs, he could have bought 12 CDs. So, the difference is 12 - 1 = 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says: "Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?"

So, originally, he bought a CD and a headphone set, which together cost $48. So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have bought only CDs. So, how many CDs can he buy with the $48?

So, number of CDs = $48 / $4 = 12.

So, originally, he bought 1 CD and 1 headphone set. If he didn't buy the headphone set, he could have bought 12 CDs. So, how many more CDs would he have been able to buy? That would be 12 - 1 = 11.

Wait, so the answer is 11? But let me make sure.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine the problem.

He bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. Total was $48. So, the cost of the CD is $4, and the cost of the headphone set is $44, as I calculated earlier.

So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have only spent $48 on CDs. So, how many CDs is that? 48 divided by 4 is 12. So, he could have bought 12 CDs.

Originally, he bought 1 CD and 1 headphone set. So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he could have bought 12 CDs. So, the number of CDs he would have been able to buy is 12. So, how many more CDs would he have been able to buy? That would be 12 - 1 = 11.

Wait, so the answer is 11 more CDs. So, 11 more CDs.

But let me think again. Is the question asking how many more CDs he could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set? So, originally, he bought 1 CD and 1 headphone set. If he didn't buy the headphone set, he could have bought 12 CDs. So, the difference is 12 -1 =1
