Q: Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Marie ordered some items and spent a total of $50. I need to figure out how many boxes of pizza she ordered. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the items she ordered and their respective costs:

1. One chicken meal: $12
2. Five packs of milk: each pack is $3, so 5 times $3
3. Four apples: each apple is $1.50, so 4 times $1.50
4. Some boxes of pizza: each box is $8.50, and we need to find how many boxes she ordered.

Alright, so the total cost is $50. Let me write down the equation for the total cost.

Total cost = cost of chicken meal + cost of milk + cost of apples + cost of pizza boxes.

Let me compute each part one by one.

Starting with the chicken meal: that's straightforward, it's $12.

Next, the milk. She ordered 5 packs, each costing $3. So, 5 multiplied by $3. Let me calculate that: 5 * 3 = 15. So, the milk costs $15.

Then, the apples. She bought 4 apples, each costing $1.50. Hmm, 4 times 1.50. Let me compute that. 4 * 1.50. Well, 1.50 times 4 is 6.00. So, the apples cost $6.00.

Now, the pizza boxes. Let me denote the number of boxes as x. Each box is $8.50, so the total cost for pizza is 8.50 * x.

So, putting it all together, the equation is:

12 + 15 +6.00 +8.50x = 50

Let me add up the known costs first. 12 +15 is 27. Then, 27 +6.00 is 33. So, 33 +8.50x =50.

Now, I need to solve for x. So, subtract 33 from both sides.

8.50x =50 -33

50 -33 is 47. So, 8.50x =47.

Now, to find x, divide both sides by8.50.

x=47 /8.50

Hmm, let me compute that. 47 divided by8.50.

First, let me write it as 47.000 divided by8.50.

I can simplify this by multiplying numerator and denominator by10 to eliminate decimals: 470 /85.

Now, let's see how many times 85 goes into470.

85*5=425, which is less than470.

85*5=425, subtract that from470: 470-425=45.

Bring down the next 0: 450.

85 goes into450 how many times? 85*5=425, which is less than450.

85*5=425, subtract: 450-425=25.

Bring down the next 0: 250.

85 goes into250 three times: 85*3=255, which is more than250. So, 2 times: 85*2=170.

Subtract:250-170=80.

Bring down the next 0:800.

85 goes into800 nine times: 85*9=765.

Subtract:800-765=135.

Bring down the next 0:1350.

85 goes into1350 sixteen times: 85*16=1360, which is more. So, 15 times:85*15=425.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe I can just do 470 divided by85.

Wait, 85*5=425, so 470-425=45. So, 5 with a remainder of45.

So, 470/85=5.54 approximately.

Wait, 85*5=425, 85*5.5=425 +42.5=467.5, which is more than470. Wait, no, 85*5=425, 85
