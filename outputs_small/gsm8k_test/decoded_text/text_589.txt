Q: If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Martin and his breakfast choices affecting his weight. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that if Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds each week. On the other hand, if he eats donuts every day, he'll gain 1.75 pounds each week. The question is asking for the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options. 

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate how much weight he'll lose if he eats Cheerios every day over 5 weeks and how much he'll gain if he eats donuts every day over the same period. Then, I can find the difference between these two amounts to see how much weight he'll gain or lose overall.

Let me break it down. 

First, for the Cheerios option: he loses 1.25 pounds each week. So, over 5 weeks, the total weight loss would be 1.25 multiplied by 5. Let me write that down:

Weight loss (Cheerios) = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks

Similarly, for the donuts option: he gains 1.75 pounds each week. So, over 5 weeks, the total weight gain would be 1.75 multiplied by 5. That would be:

Weight gain (Donuts) = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks

Once I have both totals, I can subtract the weight loss from the weight gain to find the difference. So, the difference in weight would be:

Difference = Weight gain (Donuts) - Weight loss (Cheerios)

Let me compute each part step by step.

Starting with the weight loss:

1.25 pounds per week * 5 weeks. Hmm, 1.25 times 5. Let me calculate that. 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so 5/4 * 5 is 25/4, which is 6.25. So, 6.25 pounds lost over 5 weeks.

Now, the weight gain:

1.75 pounds per week * 5 weeks. 1.75 is the same as 7/4, so 7/4 * 5 is 35/4, which is 8.75. So, 8.75 pounds gained over 5 weeks.

Now, to find the difference, I subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:

8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

So, Martin will be 2.5 pounds heavier at the end of 5 weeks if he eats donuts every day for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios every day.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 1.25 * 5: 1.25 * 5. 1 * 5 is 5, 0.25 * 5 is 1.25, so 5 + 1.25 is 6.25. That seems right.

Then, 1.75 * 5: 1 * 5 is 5, 0.75 * 5 is 3.75, so 5 + 3.75 is 8.75. That also seems correct.

Subtracting 6.25 from 8.75: 8.75 - 6.25. 8 - 6 is 2, 0.75 - 0.25 is 0.5, so 2 + 0.5 is 2.5. That looks right.

So, the difference is 2.5 pounds. So, Martin will be 2.5 pounds heavier if he eats donuts every day for breakfast over 5 weeks.

Wait, but the question is asking for the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options. So, does that mean the difference is 2.5 pounds? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the difference is the amount he gains by eating donuts instead of eating Cheerios. So, he gains 2.5 pounds more by eating donuts than he would lose by eating Cheerios. So, the net difference is 2.5 pounds gained.

Alternatively, if we think of it as the total weight change, it's 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds. So, the difference is 2.5 pounds.

I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 2.5 pounds.

But let me think again. If he eats donuts, he gains
