Q: Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.  Skyler's investment accounted for the rest. How much money was Skyler's investment?

Okay, so I have this problem here where three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. The problem says that Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. Then, after Dylan's investment, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. Finally, Skyler's investment was the rest. I need to figure out how much Skyler invested. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the total investment is $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of that. So, I should calculate how much that is. Let me write that down:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4 times 1200. Hmm, 0 times 1200 is 1200, and 0.4 is 400, so 0.4 times 1200 is 480. So, Dylan invested $480.

Okay, so after Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is 1200 - 480. Let me subtract that. 1200 minus 480 is 720. So, $720 is left after Dylan's investment.

Now, Frances invested 2/3 of that remaining amount. So, let me calculate that.

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720

Hmm, 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6666..., but let me do it properly. 2 times 720 is 1440, and then divided by 3. So, 1440 divided by 3. Let me compute that.

3 goes into 14 four times (12), remainder 2. Bring down the 4, making it 24. 3 goes into 24 eight times. So, 48. Then, bring down the 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, 480. So, Frances invested $480.

Wait, let me check that again. 2/3 of 7220. 720 divided by 3 is 240, so 2 times 240 is 480. Yeah, that's correct. So, Frances invested $480.

Now, the remaining amount after Dylan and Frances have invested is Skyler's investment. So, let's subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount after Dylan.

Remaining after Frances = 720 - 480 = 240.

So, Skyler invested $240.

Wait, let me verify that. Total investment is 1200. Dylan: 480, Frances: 480, Skyler: 240. Let's add them up: 480 + 480 is 960, plus 240 is 1200. Perfect, that adds up correctly.

So, Skyler's investment is $240.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Sometimes, when dealing with fractions, it's easy to slip up.

Starting again, total investment is 1200.

Dylan's investment: 2/5 of 1200. 1200 divided by 5 is 240, times 2 is 480. So, yes, 480.

Subtracting that from 1200: 1200 - 480 = 720. Correct.

Frances invested 2/3 of 720. 720 divided by 3 is 240, times 2 is 480. So, 480. Correct.

Subtracting that from 720: 720 - 480 = 240. So, Skyler invested 240.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, another way to approach this is to think in terms of fractions of the total amount.

Dylan invested 2/5, so that's 2/5 of 1200, which is 480.

Then, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining 3/5 of the total. Because after Dylan, 3/5 remains.

So, 2/3 of 3/5 is (2/3)*(3/5) = 6/15 = 2/5. So, Frances invested 2/5 of the total.

Wait, that's interesting. So, both Dylan and
