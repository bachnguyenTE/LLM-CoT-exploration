Q: Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?

Okay, so I have this problem about Garrett popping popcorn, and I need to figure out how many pieces he has to eat. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that as the pan heats up, the kernels start popping faster. So, the popping rate increases over time. Let me note down the details:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. Then, in the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, so 3*20 = 60 kernels.
3. Then, in the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to four times the initial rate. So, the initial rate was 20 per 30 seconds, so four times that would be 80 per 30 seconds.
4. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. So, half of 80 is 40 per 30 seconds.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I got that right. The initial rate is 20 per 30 seconds. Then, the next 30 seconds, it's three times that, so 60. Then, the next 30 seconds, it's four times the initial rate, so 80. Then, the last 30 seconds, it's half the rate of the past 30 seconds, which would be half of 80, so 44.

So, summarizing:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels popped.
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels popped.
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels popped.
- Fourth 30 seconds: 44 kernels popped.

So, total popped kernels would be 20 + 60 + 80 +44. Let me add that up.

20 + 60 is 80, plus 80 is 160, plus 44 is 204. So, total popped is 204 kernels.

But wait, the problem says that after the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, the final 30 seconds popped 44 kernels, so a quarter of that is 11. So, 11 more kernels pop from the residual heat.

Therefore, total popped is 204 +11=215.

But hold on, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. It says, "a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat." So, the final 30 seconds popped 44, so a quarter is 11. So, 11 more popped from the residual heat.

So, total popped is 204 +11=215.

But wait, is that all? Or is there more to it?

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?"

So, the total popped is 20 +60 +80 +44=208, but then a quarter of the final 30 seconds (which is 44) is 11, so total is 208 +11=209.

Wait, but 208 +11 is 209? Wait, 208 +11 is 219? Wait, no, 208 +11 is 209? Wait, 208 +11 is 219? Wait, no, 208 +11 is 209? Wait, no, 208 +11 is 200 +10=210? Wait, no, 208 +11 is 209? Wait, 208 +11 is 219? Wait, no, 208 +11 is 209? Wait, 208 +11 is 209? Wait, 208
