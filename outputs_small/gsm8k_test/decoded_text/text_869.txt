Q: An electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. How much will the seller give back in change?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so multiplying 5 by 700 gives the total expenditure.

Next, I'll determine how much change the seller should receive by subtracting the total cost from the $4000 they provided.

Finally, I'll present the change as the final answer.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:**
   
   Each phone costs \$700.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$700 = \$35,000
   \]

2. **Determine the change to be given back:**
   
   The seller received \$4,000.
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$35,000 = \$4,000 - \$3
