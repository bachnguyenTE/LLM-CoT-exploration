Okay, so Lisa is part of a choir with 52 members. Half of them are boys and half are girls. Hmm, let me see. If there are 52 members total, then 50% are boys and 50% are girls. Wait, no, 50% of 52 is 26. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. Let me check that: 26 plus 26 is 52, but wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? No, 26 plus 26 is 52. Oh, right, because 50% is 26 and 45% is 26. So, 26 boys and 26 girls? Wait, no, 50% is 26, so 50% of 52 is 26, and 45% is 26 as well. So, 26 boys and 26 girls? Wait, that can't be because 26 plus 26 is 52. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52. So, 26 boys and 26 girls? Wait, no, 50% of 52 is 26.6, which is 26.666... So, 26.6666... So, that's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 50% of 52 is 26, and 50% is 26.6666... So, that's 26 boys and 26.6666... girls. But that can't be. So, maybe the problem is that it's 50% and 50%, so 26 boys and 26 girls, but that would be 52. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52, which is not 52. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? No, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? No, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? No, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52? Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 is 26 plus 26. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 total.

So, the choir has 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 members in total. So, 26 boys and 26 girls? Wait, no, 50% is 26, 50% is 26, so 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 is 26 plus 26. Wait, 26 plus 26 is 52. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 total.

So, the choir is 52 members, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 26 boys and 26 girls. So, 52 total.

So, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. So, the 26 girls are performing. But on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 girls can't make it. So, half of 26 is 13. So, 13 girls can't make it. So, 13 girls are out. So, 26 minus 13 is 13 girls are still performing.

So, the choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. So, the 13 girls are still there, and 3 teachers are joining them. So, how many people are singing in the performance? So, 13 girls plus 3 teachers is 16 people.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, the choir has 52 members, 26 boys and 26 girls. So,
