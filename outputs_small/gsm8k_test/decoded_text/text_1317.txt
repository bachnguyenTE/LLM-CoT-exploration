Q: Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, and they're all either chickens or cows. The total number of legs is 70. I need to figure out how many of those animals are chickens. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that chickens and cows are the two types of animals here. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, if I can figure out how many chickens and cows there are, I can solve the problem. But how?

Well, I remember that in these types of problems, you can set up a system of equations. Let me try that. Let's say the number of chickens is C and the number of cows is D. So, the total number of animals is 20, which means C + D = 20. That's one equation.

Now, for the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens would be 2C. Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows would be 4D. The total number of legs is 70, so 2C + 4D = 70. That's the second equation.

So now I have two equations:
1. C + D = 20
2. 2C + 4D = 70

I need to solve this system of equations. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let me try that.

First, I can simplify the second equation. If I divide both sides by 2, I get C + 2D = 35. So now, the equations are:
1. C + D = 20
2. C + 2D = 35

Hmm, now if I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate C. Let's see:

(C + 2D) - (C + D) = 35 - 20

Simplify that:
C + 2D - C - D = 15

So, D = 15. That means there are 15 cows.

Now, plug that back into the first equation to find C. So, C + 15 = 20, which means C = 5. So, there are 5 chickens.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 5 chickens, that's 5*2=10 legs. 15 cows would be 15*4=60 legs. 10+60=70 legs. Yep, that adds up. And 5+15=20 animals. Perfect, that matches the given numbers.

So, the number of chickens is 5. I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.

1. Let C = number of chickens, D = number of cows.
2. C + D = 20
3. 2C + 4D = 70
4. Simplify equation 3: C + 2D = 35
5. Subtract equation 2 from equation 4: (C + 2D) - (C + D) = 35 - 20
6. That gives D = 15
7. Then, C = 20 - D = 5
8. Check: 5 chickens (10 legs) + 15 cows (60 legs) = 70 legs. Correct.

Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the number of chickens is 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of chickens is \boxed{5}.
</think>

Let \( C \) be the number of chickens and \( D \) be the number of cows. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + D = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2C + 4D = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing by 2:
   \[
   C + 2D = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( C + D = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2D = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (C + 2D) - (C + D) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   D = 15
   \]

Substitute \( D = 15 \) back into the first equation:
