Q: Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes while each plant of eggplant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Ricardo has a garden where he grows tomatoes and eggplants. I need to figure out how many fruits he can get from his plants. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the information given. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. He has 5 tomato plants. So, to find out how many tomatoes he gets, I should multiply the number of tomato plants by the yield per plant. That makes sense because if each plant gives 22 tomatoes, then 5 plants would give 5 times 22.

Let me write that down: 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant. Hmm, 5 times 22. Let me calculate that. 5 times 20 is 110, right? So, 5 * 22 = 110. So, Ricardo gets 110 tomatoes from his tomato plants.

Now, moving on to eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. He has 8 eggplant plants. So, similar to the tomatoes, I need to multiply the number of eggplant plants by the yield per plant. That would be 8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant.

Calculating that: 8 * 4. Well, 8 times 4 is 32. So, Ricardo gets 32 eggplants from his eggplant plants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, I need to add the number of tomatoes and the number of eggplants together. So, 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants.

Let me add those numbers. 110 + 32. Hmm, 110 + 30 is 140, and then +2 is 142. So, 110 + 32 equals 142.

Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 110 + 32. Starting from the units place: 0 + 2 is 2. Then, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, 1 + 0 is 1. So, yes, that adds up to 142. Okay, that seems right.

So, Ricardo can get a total of 142 fruits from his plants. Wait, hold on, 110 + 32 is 142? Let me verify that again. 110 + 30 is 140, and then +2 is 142. Yeah, that's correct.

So, summarizing: 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes = 110 tomatoes. 8 eggplant plants *4 eggplants =32 eggplants. Total fruits =110 +32=142.

I think that's all. I don't think I missed anything here. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants, each with their respective yields. So, multiplying each by their respective yields and then adding them together gives the total number of fruits.

Just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, does he have 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants, meaning he has 13 plants in total? But no, the question is about the number of fruits, not the number of plants. So, each plant yields a certain number of fruits, so we have to calculate the total per plant and then add them.

So, 5 tomato plants each yielding 22, so 5*22=110, and 8 eggplant plants each yielding 4, so 8*4=32. Then, 110+32=142. So, 142 is the total number of fruits.

I think that's solid. I don't see any other factors or calculations needed here. So, the answer should be 142.

**Final Answer**
The total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is \boxed{142}.

Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
\[
5 \text{ tomato plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes per plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
\[
8 \text{ eggplant plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants per plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[
110 \text{
