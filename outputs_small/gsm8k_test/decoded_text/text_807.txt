Q: Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

Okay, so I need to figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic with two bags of glass chips. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. Milo is making a mosaic using glass chips. Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 chips. He has two bags, each holding 72 chips. He wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. I need to find out how long the mosaic can be.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by figuring out how many chips Milo has in total. Since each bag has 72 chips and he has two bags, that should be 72 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down:

Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

Alright, so he has 144 glass chips in total. Now, each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 chips. So, the area of the mosaic can be calculated by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Area = Total chips / Chips per square inch = 144 / 12.

Let me compute that. 144 divided by 12 is 12. So, the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches.

Wait, hold on. The mosaic is three inches tall. So, if the area is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches, I can find the length by dividing the area by the height.

Length = Area / Height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

So, the mosaic can be 4 inches long. Let me just verify that.

Total chips: 144. Each square inch needs 12 chips, so 12 square inches. Height is 3 inches, so length is 4 inches. That seems to add up.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the area 12 square inches? So, if it's 3 inches tall, then the length is 4 inches. So, the mosaic would be 3 inches tall and 4 inches long, making it 12 square inches. That makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of volume? But no, since it's a mosaic, it's 2D, so area is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of chips per inch. Since each square inch requires 12 chips, but wait, no, each square inch requires 12 chips, so the number of chips per inch is 12 chips per square inch, which is 12 chips per square inch.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many inches can be covered with 144 chips.

Each square inch is 12 chips, so 12 chips per square inch. So, 144 chips divided by 12 chips per square inch is 12 square inches. So, 12 inches tall and 11 inches long? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me clarify.

If each square inch requires 12 chips, then the number of square inches is equal to the total number of chips divided by 12. So, 144 /12 is 12 square inches. So, the area is 12 square inches.

If the mosaic is 3 inches tall, then the length is area divided by height, which is 12 /3 =4 inches. So, that's 4 inches long.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of how many inches can be covered with 144 chips, each inch in length would require 12 chips, so 144 /12 =12 inches. But that's the total length if it's 1 inch wide. But since the height is 3 inches, the total area is 3 inches * length inches =12 square inches. So, length inches =12 /3=4 inches.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the length is 4 inches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. So, each square inch requires 12 chips, so 12 chips per square inch. So, 144 chips divided by 12 is 12 square inches. So, 12 square inches is the total area. If the height is 3 inches, then the length is 12 /3=4 inches.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think about the number of chips per inch, but that might complicate things. Let me see.

Each inch of length would require 12 chips, so 12 chips per inch. So, 144 chips divided by 12 chips per inch is 12 inches. But
