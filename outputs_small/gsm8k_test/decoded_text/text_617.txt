Okay, so I have this problem here where Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. The question is asking how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how much meat Prince sells each day. He sells 15kg every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, I think I should multiply the hourly sales by the number of hours he works each day.

Let me write that down: 15kg/hour * 10 hours/day. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150. So, Prince sells 150kg of meat each day. Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay, let me double-check. 15 times 10 is indeed 150. So, yeah, 150kg per day.

Now, the bull weighs 750kg. So, I need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all 750kg. Since he sells 150kg each day, I can divide the total weight by his daily sales.

So, 750kg divided by 150kg per day. Let me do that division. 750 divided by 150. Hmm, 150 goes into 750 how many times? Let me think. 150 times 5 is 750, right? So, 150 * 5 = 750. So, 750 divided by 150 is 5. So, that means it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 15kg per hour times 10 hours is 150kg per day. 750 divided by 150 is 5. Yeah, that seems right. So, 5 days.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of units. So, 750kg divided by (15kg/hour * 10 hours/day). So, 750kg divided by (150kg/day). That gives 5 days. Yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can think about how much meat he sells each day and how much is left each day. So, starting with 750kg, subtract 150kg each day. So, day 1: 750 - 150 = 600kg left. Day 2: 600 - 150 = 450kg left. Day 3: 450 - 150 = 300kg left. Day 4: 300 - 150 = 150kg left. Day 5: 150 - 150 = 0kg left. So, that also takes 5 days. So, that's another way to confirm.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 5 days.

**Final Answer**
It will take Prince \boxed{5} days to sell all the meat from the bull.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \,000 \, \text{kg/day} \]

The bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight by his daily sales:

\[ \frac{750 \,000 \, \text{kg}}{150 \,000 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \,000 \, \text{days} \]

Thus, it will take Prince \boxed{5} days to sell all the meat from the bull.
