Q: Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the temperature difference between the day and the night. The day temperature is 45 degrees, and the night temperature is 33 degrees colder, which means it's 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Next, I'll calculate how much the wood burning will increase the temperature. Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature increase needs to be at least 1 degree.

Finally, I'll divide the required temperature increase by the heating effect of each log to find out how many logs are needed. So, 1 degree divided by 5 degrees per log equals 0.2 logs. Since you can't burn a fraction of a log, Carson needs to burn at least 1 log.

To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Temperature Difference:**
   
   - **Day Temperature:** 45 degrees
   - **Night Temperature:** 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

2. **Calculate the Temperature Increase Needed:**
   
   - **Desired Temperature:** At least 1 degree above freezing (32 degrees)
   - **Required Temperature Increase:** 1 degree

3. **Determine the Number of Logs Needed:**
   
   - **Heating per Log:** 5 degrees
   - **Logs Required:** \(\frac{1 \text{ degree}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 0.2 \text{ logs}\)

4. **Since you can't burn a fraction of a log, round up to the next whole number:**
   
   - **Total Logs Needed:** 1

\[
\boxed{1}
