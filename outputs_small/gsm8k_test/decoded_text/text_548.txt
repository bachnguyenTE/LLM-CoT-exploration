Q: Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Mark was unwell for 3 months, and during that time, he lost 10 pounds each month. His final weight was 70 pounds. I need to find out what his initial weight was. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mark lost weight over 3 months, losing 10 pounds each month. After those 3 months, he weighed 70 pounds. So, I need to figure out how much he weighed before he started losing weight. That means I need to reverse the process of weight loss to find the starting weight.

Alright, so if he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's a total weight loss. Let me calculate that first. If he lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months, that's 10 * 3. Let me write that down:

Total weight loss = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Wait, 10 times 3 is 30? Hmm, 10 * 3 is 30? Wait, no, 10 is 10, so 10 * 3 is 30. Yeah, that's right. So he lost a total of 30 pounds over the 3 months. But wait, 30 is 30? No, 10 * 3 is 30. So, 30 pounds total weight loss.

So, if he ended up at 70 pounds after losing 30 pounds, then his initial weight must have been higher. So, initial weight = final weight + total weight loss.

So, initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If he started at 100 pounds, and lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's 30 pounds total. 100 - 30 is 70, which matches the final weight. So, that seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 10 * 3 is 30, right? 10, 20, 30. Yeah, that's correct. So, 30 pounds total loss.

So, adding that to the final weight of 70 pounds, we get 100 pounds. So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by working backwards. If after 3 months he was at 70 pounds, then before the first month, he would have been 70 + 10 = 80 pounds. Then, before the second month, he would have been 80 + 10 = 90 pounds. Then, before the third month, he would have been 90 + 10 = 100 pounds. So, that also gives 100 pounds as his initial weight.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, I think 100 pounds is the correct initial weight.

But just to make sure, let me visualize it. If he started at 100, then after the first month, he would have lost 10 pounds, so 100 - 10 = 90. After the second month, another 10 pounds, so 90 - 10 = 80. After the third month, another 10 pounds, so 80 - 10 = 70. Yep, that's exactly the final weight given. So, that checks out.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of equations, let me denote his initial weight as W. Then, each month he loses 10 pounds, so after 3 months, he would have lost 3 * 10 = 30 pounds. So, his final weight is W - 30 = 70. Therefore, solving for W, we get W = 70 + 30 = 100. So, that's another way to set it up and get the same answer.

So, all methods point to 100 pounds as his initial weight. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 100 pounds.

**Final Answer**
Mark's initial weight was \boxed{100} pounds.

Mark was unwell for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. His final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we first calculate the total weight loss over the 3 months:

\[
\text{Total weight loss} = 1
