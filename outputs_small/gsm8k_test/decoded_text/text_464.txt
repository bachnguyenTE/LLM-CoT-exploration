Q: Finley took part in a 100-meter race.  She started off in first, but then fell back 5 spots.  She then moved ahead 2 spots, before falling behind 3.  Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.  What place did she finish in?

Okay, so I have this problem about Finley and her race. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the race is 100 meters, and Finley started in first place. That means she was in position 1 at the beginning. Now, she fell back 5 spots. Hmm, I need to understand what "fell back 5 spots" means. I think it refers to her finishing position relative to the starting position. So, if she started in first, which is position 1, and then fell back 5 spots, that would mean she's now in position 1 - 5. But wait, position 1 minus 5 would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's not a subtraction but an addition? So, starting from 1, if she falls back 5 spots, she would be in position 1 + 5 = 6? That seems more logical because positions go from 1 to 100, right? So, position 6 would be the next spot after falling back 5.

Okay, so after the first move, she's in 6th place. Next, she moves ahead 2 spots. So, moving ahead 2 spots from 6 would mean adding 2, so 6 + 2 = 8. So now she's in 8th place. 

Then, she falls behind 3 spots. Hmm, similar to the first move, but now she's behind 3 spots. So, if she was in 8th place, moving behind 3 spots would mean subtracting 3 from her current position. So, 8 - 3 = 5. So, she's now in 5th place.

Finally, she jumps ahead 1 spot. So, from 5th place, jumping ahead 1 would mean adding 1, so 5 + 1 = 6. Wait, that's the same as her position after the first move. That seems a bit confusing. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the direction of the moves. Maybe "fell back 5 spots" doesn't mean subtracting 5 from her current position, but rather her position is 5 spots behind. So, if she started at 1, being 5 spots behind would be position 1 + 5 = 6. That seems consistent with my earlier thought.

Then, moving ahead 2 spots from 6 would be 6 + 2 = 8. Then, falling behind 3 spots from 8 would be 8 - 3 = 5. Then, jumping ahead 1 spot from 5 would be 5 +1 =6. So, she ends up in 6th place. But wait, that's the same as her position after the first move. Is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe "falling behind 3 spots" means she's 3 spots behind her current position. So, if she was in 8th, being 3 spots behind would be 8 - 3 =5. Then, jumping ahead 1 spot would be 5 +1 =6. So, same result.

Wait, but let me think about the directions. When she falls back 5 spots, does that mean she's moving backward in the race, so her position decreases? So, starting at 1, moving back 5 spots would be 1 -5 = -4, which doesn't make sense. So, that can't be. So, it must be that she's moving forward, so her position increases. So, starting at 1, moving forward 5 spots would be 1 +5 =6. So, that makes sense.

Similarly, moving ahead 2 spots from 6 is 6 +2 =8. Then, falling behind 3 spots from 8 is 8 -3 =5. Then, jumping ahead 1 spot from 5 is 5 +1 =6. So, she ends up in 6th place.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the moves are cumulative? So, starting at 1, then moving back 5 spots, so 1 -5 = -4, which is impossible, so maybe it's 1 +5 =6. Then, moving ahead 2 spots from 6 is 8. Then, falling behind 3 spots from 8 is 5. Then, jumping ahead 1 spot from 5 is 6. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe the moves are in the same direction. So, starting at 1, moving back 5 spots would be 1 -5 = -4, which is impossible, so maybe it's 1 +5 =6. Then, moving ahead 2 spots from 6 is 8. Then, falling behind 3 spots from 8 is 5. Then, jumping ahead 1 spot from 5 is 6. So
