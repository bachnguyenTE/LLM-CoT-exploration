Q: In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find Melanie's current age. The problem says that in 10 years, she'll be 18. So, if I subtract 10 from 18, that should give me her current age. Let me write that down:

18 (future age) - 10 (years to get there) = 8

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old. That makes sense because if she's 8 now and in 10 years she'll be 18, that adds up correctly.

Now, the next part of the question is asking: "In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?" So, her present age is 8, and we need to find out after how many years her age will be three times that. Let me think about how to set this up.

Let me denote the number of years we're looking for as 'x'. So, in 'x' years, her age will be her current age plus 'x'. And we want that future age to be three times her present age. So, mathematically, that would be:

Current age + x = 3 × Current age

Plugging in the numbers we have:

8 + x = 3 × 8

Let me compute the right side first. 3 times 8 is 24. So now the equation is:

8 + x = 24

To solve for x, I need to subtract 8 from both sides:

x = 24 - 8

Which gives:

x = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

If Melanie is currently 8, in 16 years she'll be 8 + 16 = 24. And 24 is indeed three times her current age of 8. So that seems correct.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I interpreted the question correctly. It says, "In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?" So, is it asking for when her age will be three times her current age, or three times the number of years? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased is "In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?" So, it's specifically asking for when her age will be three times her current age. So, that's 24, which is 3 times 8. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it had said "In how many years will her age be three times the number of years," that would be a different question, but that's not the case here. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.

Just to recap:

1. Find current age: 18 years old.
2. Set up equation: 8 + x = 3×8
3. Solve: x=16
4. Verify: 8+16=24, which is 3×8.

Everything checks out. So, the answer should be 16 years.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to interpret the question? Maybe "In how many years will her age be thrice her present age" could be read as "In how many years will her age be thrice as much as her present age?" But that's the same as thrice her present age, so it's the same as 24. So, yeah, 16 years is correct.

Alternatively, if it had been "In how many years will her age be thrice the number of years," that would be a different question, but that's not the case here. So, I think I'm confident that 16 is the right answer.

Just to make sure, let me think about the timeline. Melanie is 8 now. In 16 years, she'll be 24. So, 24 is three times 8. That makes sense. So, yes, 16 years is the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are straightforward: find current age, set up the equation, solve, and verify. So, I think that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The number of years is \boxed{16}.

First, we need to determine Melanie's current age. The problem states that in 10 years, she will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is calculated as follows:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8
