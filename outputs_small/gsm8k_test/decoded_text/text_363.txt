Q: John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John driving to his friend's house and then back home. Let me try to figure out how long the entire trip took. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the trip to his friend's house. It's 200 miles away, right? But wait, he had to take a detour that added 10 miles. So, does that mean the actual distance he drove to get there was more than 200 miles? Let me think. If the direct distance is 200 miles, and the detour adds 10 miles, then the total distance to his friend's house must be 200 + 10 = 210 miles. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. If the detour adds 10 miles, then the total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. But wait, 200 plus 10 is 210? No, 200 + 10 is 210, right? So, 210 miles to get there. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.

So, he drives 210 miles to get to his friend's house at a speed of 70 mph. I need to find out how long that took. Time is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, time going there would be 210 miles divided by 70 mph. Let me calculate that. 210 divided by 70. Hmm, 70 goes into 210 three times because 70 times 3 is 211. Wait, that's 211, but the distance is 210. So, actually, 70 times 2 is 140, which is less than 210. Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Wait, 70 times 3 is 210, so 210 divided by 70 is exactly 3. So, 210 divided by 70 is 3. So, the time going there is 3 hours. Hmm, that seems a bit fast, but okay, maybe he was driving fast. Let me double-check. 70 mph for 210 miles: 70 times 3 is 210, so yes, 3 hours. Okay, that seems right.

Now, after he gets to his friend's house, he takes a different route home that is 240 miles. But he goes 80 mph. So, the distance back is 240 miles, and his speed is 80 mph. Again, time is distance divided by speed. So, 240 divided by 80. Let me compute that. 80 goes into 240 three times because 80 times 3 is 240. So, the time coming back is 3 hours. Hmm, that's interesting. So, both trips took 3 hours each. So, total time is 3 hours going plus 3 hours coming back, which is 6 hours.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, going to his friend's house: 210 miles at 70 mph. 210 divided by 70 is 3. Correct. Then, coming back: 240 miles at 80 mph. 240 divided by 80 is 3. Correct. So, 3 plus 3 is 6. So, total trip took 6 hours.

But wait, let me think again. The detour added 10 miles, so the total distance was 210 miles, not 220. Because 200 plus 10 is 210, not 220. So, 210 miles at 70 mph is 3 hours. Then, 240 miles at 80 mph is 3 hours. So, 3 plus 3 is 6. So, yeah, 6 hours total.

Wait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe adding the distances and then dividing by something? But no, because the speeds are different, so you can't just average the speeds or anything like that. So, you have to calculate each leg separately.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total distance as 210 + 240, which is 450 miles, but that's not correct because the detour was only 10 miles, so the total distance is 210 + 240, which is 450 miles. But wait, no, that's not right either. Because the detour was 1
