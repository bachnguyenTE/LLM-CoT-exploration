Q: Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls for breakfast. After feeding her 6 children with one each, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. How many pieces of rolls did she feed to the chickens?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Sherman and her bread rolls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, she made a dozen bread rolls. A dozen is 12, right? So, she has 12 rolls in total.

Then, she feeds her 6 children with one each. So, each child gets one roll. That means she's used up 6 rolls for the children. Let me write that down:

Total rolls = 12
Rolls given to children = 6

So, the remaining rolls after feeding the children would be 12 minus 6. Let me calculate that: 12 - 6 = 6. So, there are 6 rolls left after feeding the children.

Now, the problem says she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. Hmm, okay. So, each of those 6 rolls is being cut into 8 pieces. I need to find out how many pieces she fed to the chickens.

So, if each roll is broken into 8 pieces, then 6 rolls would have 6 times 8 pieces. Let me write that as a multiplication:

Number of remaining rolls = 6
Pieces per roll = 8

Total pieces for chickens = 6 * 8

Let me compute that: 6 times 8 is 48. So, 48 pieces.

Wait, let me double-check that. 6 times 8, yes, 6*8 is 48. So, that seems right.

So, she had 12 rolls, used 6 for the children, leaving 6 rolls. Each of those 6 rolls is cut into 8 pieces, so 6*8=48 pieces. So, the chickens get 48 pieces.

Is there any chance I made a mistake here? Let me see. She made a dozen, which is 12. She feeds 6 children, so 12-6=6 rolls left. Each roll is cut into 8 pieces, so 6*8=48. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in another way. If each child gets one roll, that's 6 rolls. The remaining 6 rolls are each cut into 8 pieces, so each roll gives 8 pieces. So, 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll is 48 pieces. Yeah, that's consistent.

I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the answer should be 48 pieces.

**Final Answer**
The number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is \boxed{48}.

Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She feeds her 6 children with one each, so she uses 6 rolls. The remaining rolls are calculated as follows:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Each of the remaining 6 rolls is broken into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces fed to the chickens is:

\[
6 \times 8 = 48
\]

The number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is \boxed{48}.
