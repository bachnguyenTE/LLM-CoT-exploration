Q: A chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions cost $1.50. How much did the chef spend?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total weight of the onions the chef bought. Since the chef purchased 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, I'll multiply 4 by 50 to find the total weight.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the cost per pound, which is $1.50.

Finally, I'll add the two amounts together to find the total amount the chef spent.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total weight of the onions:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} = 4 \times 50\ \text{pounds} = 200\ \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 220\ \text{pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$330.0
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$330.0}
\]
