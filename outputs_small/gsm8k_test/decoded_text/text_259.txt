Q: Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 52 apples and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have 52 minus 8, which is 44 apples.

Next, I'll find out how many bananas Jamal has. Jamal has 4 more bananas than Andrea's apples. Andrea has 52 apples, so Jamal has 52 plus 4, totaling 56 bananas.

Finally, to find the total number of fruits, I'll add Andrea's apples, Jamal's apples, and Jamal's bananas together: 52 + 44 + 56, which equals 152 fruits.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have.

**Given:**
1. **Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.**
2. **Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.**
3. **Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.**
4. **Andrea has 52 apples.**

**Step 1: Determine Jamal's Apples**

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
\[
\text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8
\]
\[
52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8
\]
\[
\text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

**Step 2: Determine Jamal's Bananas**

Jamal has 4 more bananas than Andrea's apples:
\[
\text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Andrea's apples} + 4
\]
\[
\text{Jamal's bananas} = 52 + 4 = 56
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Total Fruits**

Now, add up all the fruits:
\[
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas}
\]
\[
\text{Total fruits} = 52 + 44 + 56 = 152
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{152}
\]
