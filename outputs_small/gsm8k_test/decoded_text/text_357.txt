Q: Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

Morgan's dad said she has $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. 

First, let me note down all the information given:

- Total budget: $90
- Amount for mini-golf: $5
- Amount for arcade tokens: $5
- Number of go-kart rides: 2, each costing $10

Wait, hold on, the go-kart cost is $10? That seems a bit high, but okay, let's go with that for now.

So, she wants to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. So, the total expenses will be the cost of mini-golf plus the cost of two go-kart rides plus the $5 in tokens.

Let me write that down:

Total expenses = Mini-golf cost + Arcade tokens + Go-kart rides cost

Plugging in the numbers:

Total expenses = $5 + $5 + (2 * $10)

Calculating that:

$5 + $5 = $10

2 * $10 = $20

So, total expenses = $10 + $20 = $30

Wait, that can't be right. If she has $90 budgeted, and she's spending $30, that would leave her with $60 for other things, but the problem doesn't mention anything else. So, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says she wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. So, that's the only expenses she's planning for. So, the total amount she needs to spend is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + 2 * $10 (go-karts). So, that's $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

So, she has $90 budgeted, so the remaining money after expenses would be $90 - $30 = $60. But the problem doesn't mention anything else, so maybe that's all she's planning for.

Wait, but the question is asking how many friends she can invite. So, maybe the $30 is the total she's spending, and the rest is for other things, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the $90 is the total budget, and she's planning to spend $5 on mini-golf, $5 on tokens, and $20 on go-karts, so the remaining money is for other things, but the question is about how many friends she can invite, so maybe the $30 is the total she's spending, and the rest is for other expenses, but the problem doesn't specify. So, perhaps the $30 is the total she's spending, and the rest is for other stuff, but the question is about how many friends she can invite, so maybe the $30 is the total she's spending, and the rest is for other stuff, but the problem doesn't specify.
