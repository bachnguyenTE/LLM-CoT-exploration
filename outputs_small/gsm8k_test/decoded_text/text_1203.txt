Q: Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mattison's house. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times as high as he is. The question is asking how high the roof is from the second floor's floor.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Mattison's height is 60 inches. His house is two-story, so that means it has two floors. The first thing I need to figure out is the total height of the house. It says the house is 7 times as high as Mattison. So, if Mattison is 60 inches, then the house's height would be 7 multiplied by 60 inches.

Let me write that down:

Height of house = 7 * Mattison's height
Height of house = 7 * 60 inches

Calculating that, 7 times 60. Let me do the multiplication. 7 times 60. Well, 7 times 60 is 420. So, the house is 420 inches tall.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? 7 times 60. Let me check. 60 times 7: 60*7 is 420, yes. So, 420 inches. That seems correct.

Now, the next part is about the first floor. It says the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times as high as Mattison's height. So, Mattison is 60 inches, so the first floor's ceiling is 3 times that.

So, first floor ceiling height = 3 * Mattison's height
First floor ceiling height = 3 * 60 inches

Calculating that, 3 times 60 is 180 inches. So, the ceiling on the first floor is 180 inches high.

Wait, but hold on. Is that the height from the ground or from the first floor to the ceiling? Hmm, the problem says "the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is." So, I think that means from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height. So, that would be 180 inches.

But wait, Mattison is 60 inches tall, so if the first floor's ceiling is 3 times that, it's 180 inches. But Mattison's height is 60 inches, so 180 inches is 3 times 60 inches. So, that makes sense.

But wait, the house is 420 inches tall. So, if the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, then the remaining height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof would be 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

But wait, the question is asking how high the roof is from the second floor's floor. So, that would be the distance from the second floor's floor to the roof.

So, if the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, then the second floor's floor is one floor below that. Since the house is two-story, the second floor is one floor below the first floor.

But wait, Mattison is 60 inches tall, so the first floor is 60 inches high, right? So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, which is 3 times Mattison's height. So, the first floor is 60 inches high, and the ceiling is 180 inches. So, the distance from the first floor's floor to the ceiling is 180 inches.

But Mattison is 60 inches, so the first floor is 60 inches high, meaning the ceiling is 180 inches. So, the distance from the first floor's floor to the ceiling is 180 inches.

But the house is 420 inches tall. So, the first floor's ceiling is 180 inches, so the remaining height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

But the question is asking how high the roof is from the second floor's floor. So, the second floor is one floor below the first floor. So, the second floor's floor is 60 inches below the first floor's ceiling.

Wait, no. Wait, Mattison is 60 inches tall, so the first floor is 60 inches high, meaning the ceiling is 180 inches. So, the first floor's floor is 60 inches, and the ceiling is
