Q: Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?

Okay, so Richard wants to make a video where he puts a branded candy inside a fountain of diet soda in his driveway. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. After starting at the first bottle, it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. The question is asking how many seconds total it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the driveway is 24 feet wide, and he's placing a bottle every 3 feet. So, I need to figure out how many bottles he'll need. That should be the total width divided by the distance between each bottle. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, he'll need 8 bottles.

Wait, hold on. If he starts at the first bottle, then the next one is 3 feet away, then another 3 feet, and so on. So, starting at 0 feet, the next is at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. Wait, that's 8 bottles, right? Because 24 divided by 3 is 8, so 8 intervals, which means 9 bottles? Wait, no, hold on. If he starts at the first bottle, then each subsequent bottle is 3 feet apart. So, the number of intervals is one less than the number of bottles. So, if he has 8 intervals, he needs 9 bottles? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. If the driveway is 24 feet wide, and he's placing a bottle every 3 feet, starting at the first bottle. So, the first bottle is at 0 feet, the next at 3, then 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. So, that's 8 intervals, which would mean 9 bottles. Wait, but 24 divided by 3 is 8, so 8 intervals, 9 bottles. So, 8 intervals, 9 bottles.

But wait, the question says he wants to put a bottle every 3 feet. So, starting at the first bottle, then every 3 feet. So, the number of bottles is 24 divided by 3, which is 8. So, 8 bottles. So, 8 intervals, 8 bottles. So, 8 intervals, each taking 5 seconds. So, total time is 8 times 5, which is 40 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure. If he starts at the first bottle, then the next is 3 feet, so the first bottle is at 0, second at 3, third at 6, fourth at 9, fifth at 12, sixth at 15, seventh at 18, eighth at 21, ninth at 24. So, that's 9 bottles. So, 9 intervals, each taking 5 seconds. So, 9 times 5 is 45 seconds.

Wait, now I'm confused. So, is it 8 or 9 bottles? Let me think. If the driveway is 24 feet wide, and he's placing a bottle every 3 feet, starting at the first bottle. So, the first bottle is at 0 feet, then the next is at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24. So, that's 9 bottles. So, 9 intervals, each taking 5 seconds. So, 9 times 5 is 45 seconds.

But wait, the question says "after starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next." So, starting at the first bottle, the time to go to the next is 5 seconds. So, if he has 9 bottles, he needs to go from the first to the second, which is 5 seconds, then from the second to the third, another 5 seconds, and so on until the eighth interval to the ninth bottle.

So, that's 8 intervals, each taking 5 seconds, so 8 times 5 is 40 seconds.

Wait, but if he starts at the first bottle, then the first interval is from first to second, which is 5 seconds, then second to third, another 5 seconds, etc., until the eighth interval, which is from the eighth to the ninth bottle, which is 5 seconds. So, that's 8 intervals, 8 times 5, which is 40 seconds.

But earlier,
