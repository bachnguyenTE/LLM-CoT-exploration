Q: Rachel bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. The other day her brother ate 44 of those cookies. How many cookies are left for Rachel?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cookies Rachel has after receiving cookies from Janet and her brother eating some.

Rachel initially has 23 cookies. She receives an additional 42 cookies from Janet, so I add those together: 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.

Next, her brother eats 44 of the cookies. I subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total: 65 - 44 = 21 cookies.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Cookies Rachel Has:**
   - Rachel starts with **23 cookies**.

2. **Cookies Received from Janet:**
   - Janet gives Rachel **42 cookies**.
   - **Total cookies after receiving from Janet:**  
     \[
     23 + 42 = 65 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Cookies Eaten by Rachel's Brother:**
   - Rachel's brother eats **44 cookies**.
   - **Cookies left after brother eats:**  
     \[
     65 - 44 = 21 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{21}
   \]
