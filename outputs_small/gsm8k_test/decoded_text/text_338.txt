Q: A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this (smallest) group?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where there are 200 students in a class, and they need to be split into three groups. Two of the groups are equal in number, and the third group, which is the smallest, is 10 less than each of the other groups. I need to figure out how many students are in this smallest group. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. There are three groups: two of them are equal, and the third is smaller by 10 students. So, if I let the number of students in each of the larger groups be, say, x, then the smallest group would be x - 10. Wait, but 10 is written as 10, which is a bit confusing. Is that 10 or 10? Maybe it's a typo, but I think it's more likely 10, meaning 10 students less. So, the smallest group is x - 10.

But wait, hold on, 10 is a bit of an awkward number. Maybe it's supposed to be 10? That would make more sense because 10 is not a standard number. So, I think it's a typo, and it should be 10. So, the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, if the other groups have x students each, the smallest group has x - 10.

So, now, the total number of students is 200. So, the sum of all three groups should be 220. So, if I have two groups of x and one group of x -10, then the total is 2x + (x -10) = 220.

Let me write that down as an equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 220

Wait, hold on, 10 or 1? If it's 10, then the equation would be 2x + (x -10) = 220. But if it's 1, then it's 2x + (x -1) = 220. Hmm, 10 seems more plausible because 1 is too small for a group size, especially when you have 220 students. So, I think it's 10. So, the equation is 2x + (x -10) = 220.

Wait, but 220 is the total number of students, right? So, 2x + (x -10) = 220.

Let me write that again:

2x + (x -10) = 220

So, combining like terms, 2x + x -10 = 220

So, 3x -10 = 220

Then, adding 10 to both sides: 3x = 230

Then, dividing both sides by 3: x = 230 / 3

Wait, 230 divided by 3 is approximately 76.666... Hmm, that's a fraction. But the number of students should be a whole number, right? So, that suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, so if x is 76.666, that's not a whole number, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a student. So, that must mean that my equation is wrong.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I misread the problem. It says, "2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups." So, maybe the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, which are equal. So, if the other two groups are equal, each has x students, and the smallest group is x -10.

So, the total number of students is 2x + (x -10) = 220.

So, 2x + x -10 = 220

Wait, 2x + x is 3x, and 3x -10 = 220

So, 3x = 220 +10 = 230

So, x = 230 /3

Again, 230 divided by 3 is approximately 76.666, which is still a fraction. Hmm, that's not possible. So, maybe my initial equation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, but the other groups are equal. So
