Q: A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a candle melting over time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is: A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM? Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like we're dealing with a candle that's burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and during that time, it melts at a constant rate of 2 centimeters per hour. So, I need to find out how much shorter the candle will be after that duration.

Alright, let's break this down. The time period from 1:0 PM to 5:0 PM is how many hours? Let me count. From 1:0 PM to 2:0 PM is 1 hour, 2:0 PM to 3:00 PM is another hour, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is another hour, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is the last hour. So that's 4 hours in total. So, the candle burns for 4 hours.

Now, the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour. So, if it's burning for 4 hours, the total amount it will melt is 2 centimeters multiplied by 4 hours. Let me write that down: 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm. So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:0 PM to 5:0 PM.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Sometimes, when dealing with time, it's easy to miscount the hours. Let me recount the time period. Starting at 1:0 PM, the next hour is 2:00 PM, then 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and finally 5:00 PM. So, that's 4 hours, right? So, 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is 2, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 3, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4. Yep, that's 4 hours.

So, the burning time is 4 hours. Each hour, it melts 2 cm. So, 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm. So, the total decrease in height is 8 centimeters.

Is there any chance that the burning time is different? Like, does the candle burn continuously or does it stop at some point? The problem doesn't specify any such details, so I think it's safe to assume that it burns continuously from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours.

Another thing to consider is whether the melting rate is constant throughout the burning period. The problem says it melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. So, that suggests that the rate is constant, not varying. So, it's a linear decrease in height over time.

Therefore, the total decrease is just the product of the rate and the time. So, 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm. So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

Wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a timeline or something. Let's imagine the candle at 1:00 PM. At 1:00 PM, it's at some height, say H cm. Then, every hour after that, it loses 2 cm. So, at 2:00 PM, it's H - 2 cm. At 3:00 PM, it's H - 4 cm. At 4:00 PM, it's H - 6 cm. At 5:00 PM, it's H - 8 cm. So, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is 4 hours, it's lost 8 cm. So, that's another way to see it.

Alternatively, maybe using a table. Let's make a table of time and height:

- 1:00 PM: H cm
- 2:00 PM: H - 2 cm
- 3:00 PM: H - 4 cm
- 4:00 PM: H - 6 cm
- 5:00 PM: H -8 cm

So, at 5:00 PM, it's 8 cm shorter. So, that's consistent with the previous calculation.
