Q: Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. How many legs do the animals have, all together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Farmer Brown and his animals. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and all of them are either chickens or cows. That's straightforward. Then it mentions that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Hmm, okay, so chickens are in larger numbers compared to cows. I need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I should start by figuring out how many chickens and how many cows there are. Since all the animals are either chickens or cows, the total number of animals is the sum of chickens and cows. 

Let me denote the number of cows as C. Then, since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens would be 2C. So, the total number of animals is C (cows) plus 2C (chickens), which equals 3C. 

But wait, the problem says there are 60 animals in total. So, 3C equals 60. To find C, I can divide both sides by 3. That gives me C = 60 / 3, which is 20. So, there are 20 cows. 

Then, the number of chickens would be twice that, so 2 * 20 = 40 chickens. Let me check that: 20 cows plus 40 chickens equals 60 animals. Yep, that adds up. 

Now, the next part is figuring out the total number of legs. I know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, I need to calculate the legs from the chickens and the legs from the cows separately and then add them together.

Starting with the chickens: there are 40 chickens, each with 2 legs. So, 40 * 2 = 88 legs from the chickens. 

Then, the cows: there are 20 cows, each with 4 legs. So, 20 * 4 = 80 legs from the cows. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check that. 20 cows times 4 legs each is indeed 80 legs. Hmm, okay, so 88 legs from chickens and 80 legs from cows. 

Adding those together: 88 + 80 = 168 legs in total. 

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. He has 20 cows and 40 chickens. 20 cows times 4 legs is 80, and 40 chickens times 2 legs is 80. Wait, hold on, that adds up to 160 legs. Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 168. Hmm, where's the discrepancy?

Wait, no, hold on. 20 cows times 4 is 80, and 40 chickens times 2 is 80. So, 80 + 80 is 160. But earlier, I thought it was 168. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me go back. If there are 20 cows, that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs. 40 chickens, 44 * 2 = 88 legs. 88 + 80 is 168. Wait, no, 20 cows is 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and 40 chickens is 40 * 2 = 80 legs. So, 80 + 80 is 160. Wait, that's 160. But 20 cows and 40 chickens is 60 animals. 20 * 4 = 80, 40 * 2 = 80, 80 + 80 is 168. Wait, no, 20 cows is 80 legs, 40 chickens is 80 legs, so 80 + 80 is 168. But 20 cows is 80 legs, 40 chickens is 80 legs, so 80 +80 is 168. Wait, now I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, 20 cows is 20 cows, so 20 *4=88 legs. 40 chickens is 40 chickens, 40*2=88 legs. 88 +88=176 legs. Wait, that can't be right because 20 cows and 40 chickens is 60 animals. 20 cows and 40 chickens
