Q: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice every lunch and dinner. I need to figure out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 people, and they eat rice twice a day—once for lunch and once for dinner. So, I need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then see how many days 42 kg of rice will last, and then convert that into weeks.

Alright, let's start with the daily consumption. Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal. Since there are 5 people, the total consumption per meal would be 5 multiplied by 0.2 kg. Let me write that down:

Total rice per meal = 5 people * 0.2 kg/person/meal = 1 kg/meal.

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 0.2 is 1. So, each meal, the household consumes 1 kg of rice. But they eat twice a day—lunch and dinner. So, the total daily consumption would be 2 meals multiplied by 1 kg per meal.

Total daily rice consumption = 2 meals/day * 1 kg/meal = 2 kg/day.

Okay, so each day, they use 2 kg of rice. Now, the total amount of rice is 42 kg. To find out how many days this will last, I can divide the total rice by the daily consumption.

Number of days = Total rice / Daily consumption = 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Wait, 42 divided by 2 is 21? No, that's 21? Wait, 42 divided by 2 is 21? No, 21 is 21? Wait, no, 42 divided by 2 is 21? No, 21 is 21? Wait, no, 42 divided by 2 is 21? No, 21 is 21? Wait, 21 is 21? Wait, no, 42 divided by 2 is 21. Wait, 21 days? Wait, 21 days? Wait, 21 days? Wait, 21 days? Wait, 21 days? Wait, no, 42 divided by 2 is 21. So, 21 days.

Wait, 2 kg per meal, 2 meals a day, so 2 kg per day. 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days. So, 21 days.

But the question is asking for how many weeks. So, 21 days divided by 7 days per week is 3 weeks.

Wait, 21 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 0. So, 3 weeks exactly.

Wait, so 21 days is 3 weeks. So, 42 kg of rice will last 3 weeks.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal. 5 people, so 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg per meal. That's correct.

They eat twice a day, so 1 kg * 2 = 2 kg per day. Correct.

42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days. 21 days divided by 7 is 3 weeks. So, 3 weeks.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that the consumption is per person or per meal? The problem says each person consumes 0.2 kg every meal. So, per meal, it's 0.2 kg per person. So, 5 people, so 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg per meal. So, that's correct.

So, 1 kg per meal, 2 meals a day, so 2 kg per day. 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days, which is 3 weeks.

Wait, but 21 days is 21 days, which is 3 weeks. So, 3 weeks is the answer.

Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe per week?

Alternatively, per week, how much rice is consumed?

Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal, twice a week. So, 0.2 kg * 2 meals = 0.4 kg per person per week.

5 people, so 5 * 0
