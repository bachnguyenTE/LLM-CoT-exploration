Q: The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.

Okay, so I have this problem here about water passing through a river, and I need to figure out the total amount after a few days. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that at one point in time, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. That's the starting point. Then, after a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles. So, on the first day, it goes from 4000 gallons to 8000 gallons. That makes sense because doubling means multiplying by 2.

Now, the problem mentions that on the third day, the volume increases by 6000 gallons. Hmm, so I need to figure out what the volume is on the third day. Let me think. So, after the first day, it's 8000 gallons. On the second day, does it double again? Or does it just increase by 6000 gallons? The wording is a bit unclear. It says "the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day." So, does that mean it increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, or does it double on the third day?

Wait, let me read it again: "the amount of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day." So, it's increasing by 6000 gallons on the third day. So, that would mean that on the third day, the volume is the previous day's volume plus 6000 gallons.

So, let's map this out:

- Day 0: 4000 gallons
- Day 1: 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons
- Day2: 8000 * 2 = 16000 gallons
- Day3: 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons

Wait, hold on. If on the third day, it increases by 6000 gallons, that would mean that on the third day, the volume is 16000 + 6000 = 22000 gallons. But that seems a bit confusing because the doubling is happening each day, but then on the third day, it's just increasing by 6000. So, is the doubling only happening on the first day, or is the doubling happening every day?

Wait, the problem says "after a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point." So, that's after the first day of heavy rain. So, on day 1, it doubles. Then, on day 2, does it double again, or does it just increase by 6000? The problem isn't entirely clear.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point."

So, the initial amount is 4000. After a day of heavy rain, it doubles. So, that's day 1: 4000 * 2 = 8000.

Then, on the third day, it increases by 6000. So, that would be 8000 + 6000 = 14800 gallons on day 3.

Wait, but hold on, is the doubling happening every day, or only after the first day? The problem says "after a day of heavy rain, the amount doubles." So, that's after the first day. So, on day 1, it's 8000. Then, on day 2, is it doubling again, or is it increasing by 6000?

The problem doesn't specify, so I think we have to assume that after the first day of heavy rain, the amount doubles each subsequent day. So, day 1: 8000, day 2: 16000, day 3: 32000, but then it says on the third day, it increases by 6000. So, that would be 32000 + 6000 = 38000.

Wait, but that seems inconsistent because if it's doubling each day, then on day 3, it should be 16000 * 2 = 32000,
