Q: Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?

Okay, so Tim wants to make lemonade for a pool party. He needs to figure out how many lemons he'll need. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the recipe says for a gallon of lemonade, he needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. He's planning to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Hmm, so if each gallon requires 1 cup, then 4 gallons would require 4 cups of lemon juice. That makes sense.

Now, he found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. So, if he needs 4 cups, how many lemons is that? Let me calculate that. If 6 lemons make 1 cup, then 4 cups would be 4 times 6 lemons. So, 4 * 6 = 24 lemons. Okay, so Tim needs 24 lemons for the 4 gallons.

But wait, Allen asked if he could make an extra gallon that was twice as tart as the other gallons. Hmm, so that extra gallon is twice as tart. Does that mean he needs twice as many lemons? Or does it mean something else?

Let me think. If the original 4 gallons are a certain amount of lemon juice, and the extra gallon is twice as tart, does that mean it requires twice as much lemon juice? Or does it mean it's twice as tart, which might relate to the number of lemons used?

Wait, the original recipe is for a gallon, and he's making 4 gallons. So, each gallon is 1 cup. If the extra gallon is twice as tart, maybe it needs more lemon juice? Or perhaps it's a different concentration of lemon juice?

But the question is about the number of lemons needed. So, if the original 4 gallons require 24 lemons, and the extra gallon is twice as tart, does that mean it needs twice as much lemon juice? So, if the original is 1 cup, the extra would be 2 cups? So, 2 cups would require 2 *6=12 lemons. So, total lemons would be 24 +12=26.

But wait, the question says the extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons. So, if the other gallons are a certain tartness, the extra is twice as much. But how does that translate to the amount of lemon juice needed?

If the original is 1 cup, and the extra is twice as tart, maybe it's 2 cups? So, 2 cups would require 12 lemons. So, total would be 24 +12=26.

Alternatively, maybe the extra gallon is twice as tart, meaning it's more concentrated, so it requires more lemon juice. But the question is about the number of lemons, not the amount of juice.

Wait, the original recipe is 1 cup of juice per gallon. If the extra gallon is twice as tart, perhaps it's using more lemons? Or maybe it's using the same amount of juice but more lemons.

But the question is about the number of lemons. So, if the original is 1 cup, and the extra is twice as tart, maybe it's using twice as much lemon juice, which would be 2 cups, so 12 lemons. So, total would be 24 +12=36.

But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the extra gallon is twice as tart, meaning it's using twice as much lemon juice, but the number of lemons is the same as the original. But that doesn't make sense because the number of lemons is tied to the amount of juice.

Wait, maybe the tartness is related to the concentration. If the original is 1 cup, and the extra is twice as tart, maybe it's 2 cups, so 12 lemons. So, total is 24 +12=36.

But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the extra gallon is twice as tart, so it's using twice as much lemon juice, but the number of lemons is the same as the original. But that doesn't make sense because the number of lemons is tied to the amount of juice.

Wait, maybe the tartness is related to the number of lemons. If the original is 1 cup, and the extra is twice as tart, maybe it's using twice as many lemons. So, 24 +12=36.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons. So, if the other gallons are a certain amount, the extra is twice as tart. So, if the other gallons are 1 cup, the extra is 2 cups. So, 2 cups would need 12 lemons. So, total is 24 +12=36.

But
