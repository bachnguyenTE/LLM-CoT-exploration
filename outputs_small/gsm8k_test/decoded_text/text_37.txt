Q: John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money John has after selling his lego sets. He sells each lego set for $15 and has 13 of them. So, I'll multiply 13 by 15 to find the total amount he made from selling the lego sets.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the video games he bought. Each video game costs $20 and he bought 8 of them. Multiplying 8 by 20 will give me the total expenditure on video games.

After that, I'll add the $5 he has left after buying the video games to the total amount he spent on video games to find his total expenditure.

Finally, I'll subtract the total expenditure from the total amount he made from selling the lego sets to determine how many lego sets he still has.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money from selling lego sets:**
   
   John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of video games:**
   
   John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount of money John has after buying the video games:**
   
   He has $5 left after buying the video games.
   
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Total from lego sets} + \text{Money left} = 195 + 5 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Find out how many lego sets John still has:**
   
   Since he spent all his money on lego sets, the number of lego sets he has is equal to the number he initially sold.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of lego sets} = 13
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{13}
\]
