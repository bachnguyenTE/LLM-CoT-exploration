Okay, so I have this problem here about a council meeting where they voted on a new regulation. The question says that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. And there are 33 people on the council. I need to find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the council has 33 people. So, the total number of votes is 33. Now, the vote passed had twice as many votes in favor as against it. So, if I let the number of votes against be some number, then the number in favor would be twice that.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me call the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Then, the number of votes in favor would be '2x' because it's twice as many as against.

So, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against. That would be x (against) + 2x (in favor) = 3x. But we know the total number of votes is 33. So, 3x = 33.

To find x, I can divide both sides by 3. So, x = 33 / 3 = 11. That means there were 11 votes against the new regulation.

But the question is asking for the number of votes in favor, which is twice that. So, 2x = 2 * 11 = 22. So, 22 votes in favor.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 11 votes against and 22 in favor, that adds up to 33 total votes, which matches the total number of council members. And 22 is indeed twice 11, so that seems to fit.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using ratios or something else? Let me see. The ratio of votes in favor to against is 2:1. So, for every 1 vote against, there are 2 in favor. So, the total parts of the ratio are 1 + 2 = 3 parts. Each part is equal to 33 / 3 = 11. So, each part is 11 votes. Therefore, the votes in favor are 2 parts, which is 22. Yep, same answer.

So, I think that's solid. The number of votes in favor is 22.

**Final Answer**
The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \boxed{22}.

Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation. Then, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \). The total number of votes is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\).
