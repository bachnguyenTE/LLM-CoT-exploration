Q: Stanley was standing on the side of the mountain, at an elevation of 10,000 feet, when a gust air blew the comb out of his pocket, causing the comb to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below.  Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Stanley and his comb. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Stanley is standing on the side of a mountain, and his elevation is 10,000 feet. Wait, that's 10,000 feet? Yeah, that's 10,000 feet. Then, a gust of wind blows the comb out of Stanley's pocket, causing it to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below. So, the comb falls 4,000 feet. 

Now, Stanley's brother, Oliver, is also on the mountain, but he's at an elevation of 3,000 feet. So, Oliver is at 3,000 feet. Stanley calls Oliver to find Stanley's comb. The question is, how many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 3,000 feet below. Wait, no, actually, it fell 4,000 feet. So, the comb is now at 3,000 feet minus 4,000 feet? Or is it 10,000 minus 4,000? Wait, no, the comb fell from Stanley's position, so it's 10,000 minus 4,000 feet. Let me calculate that.

10,000 minus 4,000 is 6,000 feet. So, the comb is now at 6,000 feet elevation. But wait, Stanley is at 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so it's 10,000 minus 4,000, which is 6,000. So, the comb is now at 6,000 feet.

But wait, hold on. Stanley is at 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is at 10,000 minus 4,000, which is 6,000 feet. So, the comb is now at 6,000 feet. 

But then, Oliver is at 3,000 feet. So, how many feet does Oliver need to climb to reach 6,000 feet? So, the difference between 6,000 and 3,000 is 3,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because Stanley is at 10,000, and the comb is at 6,000, so the difference is 4,000 feet. But Stanley's elevation is 10,000, so the comb is 4,000 feet below that. So, the comb is at 6,000 feet. So, if Oliver is at 3,000 feet, he needs to climb 3,000 feet to get to 6,000. So, the answer is 3,000 feet.

Wait, but let me make sure. Is the question asking how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb? So, Stanley's comb is at 6,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. So, the difference is 6,000 minus 3,000, which is 3,000 feet. So, yes, that's correct.

But hold on, let me think again. Is the comb falling from Stanley's position, so it's 10,0000 minus 4,000, which is 6,000. So, the comb is at 6,000 feet. So, Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 6,000 minus 3,000, which is 3,000 feet. So, 3,000 feet. So, the answer is 3,000 feet.

Wait, but hold on, is the question about the elevation of the comb? So, Stanley's comb is at 6,000 feet, so Oliver needs to climb to 6,000 feet. So, if he is at 3,000 feet, he needs to climb 6,000 minus 3,000, which is 3,000 feet. So,
