Q: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?

Okay, so I have this problem about a food truck that only sells grilled cheese. Let me try to figure out their net profit step by step. Hmm, net profit is usually total revenue minus total costs, right? So I need to calculate both the revenue they make and the costs they incur, and then subtract the costs from the revenue to get the net profit.

First, let me break down the information given:

1. **Cost of bread per loaf:** $3.00 each.
2. **Number of sandwiches per loaf:** 10.
3. **Cost of cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches:** $30.00.
4. **Selling price per sandwich:** $7.00.

Alright, so they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. Wait, no, actually, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, each sandwich is sold for $7.00. So, if they make 10 sandwiches, they make 10 times $7.00. Let me write that down.

First, let's figure out how many sandwiches they can make with $30.00 on bread. Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches and costs $3.00, the number of loaves they can make is $30 divided by $3.00 per loaf. Let me calculate that.

Number of loaves = Total money / Cost per loaf = $30 / $3 = 10 loaves.

So, 10 loaves, each making 10 sandwiches, so total sandwiches made would be 10 * 10 = 100 sandwiches.

Wait, hold on, 10 loaves * 10 sandwiches per loaf is 100 sandwiches? Wait, no, 10 loaves * 10 sandwiches per loaf is 130 sandwiches? Wait, no, 10 loaves * 10 is 100. Wait, no, 10 loaves? Wait, no, 10 loaves * 10 sandwiches per loaf is 130? Wait, no, 10 loaves * 10 sandwiches is 100. Wait, 10 loaves * 10 is 100. Wait, 10 times 10 is 100. So, 10 loaves make 100 sandwiches.

Wait, but they spend $30 on cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches. So, if they make 100 sandwiches, how much do they spend on cheeses and condiments?

Since it's $30 per 10 sandwiches, for 100 sandwiches, that's 10 times 10, so 10 times $30. Let me calculate that.

Cost of cheeses and condiments = (Number of 10-sandwich groups) * ($30 per 10 sandwiches) = 10 * $30 = $300.

So, total costs are the cost of bread plus the cost of cheeses and condiments. The cost of bread is $30, and the cost of cheeses and condiments is $300, so total cost is $30 + $300 = $330.

Now, let's calculate the revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. So, if they make 100 sandwiches, how much do they make?

Number of sandwiches sold = 100.

Selling price per sandwich = $7.00.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Selling price per sandwich = 100 * $7.00.

Let me compute that. 100 * 7 is 700, so 100 * 7.00 is $700.0.

So, total revenue is $700.00.

Now, net profit is total revenue minus total costs. So, $700.00 - $330.00.

Let me subtract that. 700 minus 330 is 430. So, $430.00.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, bread: $30.00 for 10 loaves, each loaf 10 sandwiches. So, 10 loaves * 10 = 100 sandwiches. Correct.

Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 per 10 sandwiches. So, for 100 sandwiches, that's 10 groups of 10, so 10 * $30 = $300. Correct.

Total cost: $30 + $300 =
