Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides at the carnival. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the costs involved. There are two options: buying a ride bracelet or buying ride tickets. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides. On the other hand, each ride ticket costs $2, and each ride ticket allows you to go on one ride. Since there are 9 rides in total, buying individual tickets would cost 9 times $2.

So, let me calculate the cost for each option.

Starting with the ride bracelet: It's straightforward. The bracelet itself costs $30, and it gives you all 9 rides for free. So, if David buys the bracelet, he doesn't have to spend any money on the rides, right? He just pays $30 for the bracelet and gets all the rides.

Now, let's calculate the cost if David buys ride tickets. Each ride ticket is $2, and he needs 9 of them because there are 9 rides. So, the total cost for tickets would be 9 multiplied by $2. Let me write that out:

9 rides * $2 per ride = $18.

So, if David buys individual tickets, he spends $18 for all 9 rides. But if he buys the bracelet, he only spends $30. Therefore, the difference between these two amounts will be how much money David saves by choosing the bracelet instead of buying tickets.

To find the savings, I subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of the tickets:

$18 (tickets) - $30 (bracelet) = -$12.

Wait, that can't be right. If the bracelet is more expensive, then the difference should be positive, right? Hmm, maybe I got the subtraction backwards. Let me think.

Wait, no, actually, if the bracelet is $30 and the tickets are $18, then the bracelet is more expensive. So, the amount saved is the difference between the two. So, actually, the correct way is:

Cost of tickets: $18

Cost of bracelet: $30

So, the difference is $30 - $18 = $22.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, David saves $22 by buying the bracelet instead of buying individual tickets.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the cost of 9 ride tickets: 9 * $2 = $18. That seems correct.

Cost of the bracelet: $30. So, if he buys the bracelet, he spends $30, but if he buys tickets, he spends $18. So, the amount he would have spent if he bought tickets is $18, but he actually spends $30. So, the difference is $30 - $18 = $22. So, he saves $22.

Wait, but hold on, is the bracelet a one-time cost or is it a per-ride cost? The problem says, "You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides." So, it's a one-time $30 to get 9 rides, regardless of how many times you go on the rides. So, if he buys the bracelet, he gets all 9 rides without spending any money on tickets.

So, if he buys the bracelet, he spends $30 and gets all 9 rides. If he buys individual tickets, he spends $18 and gets all 9 rides. So, the difference is $30 - $18 = $12. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought.

Wait, no, hold on. If he buys the bracelet, he spends $30, but gets all 9 rides. If he buys individual tickets, he spends $18, but also gets all 9 rides. So, the total amount he spends is $30 vs. $18. So, the difference is $30 - $18 = $12. So, he saves $12 by buying the bracelet instead of buying individual tickets.

Wait, so which is it? Is the bracelet $30 or is it $30 for 9 rides? The problem says, "You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides." So, the bracelet is $30, and it gives you 9 rides for free. So, if he buys the bracelet, he spends $30 and gets all 9 rides. If he buys individual tickets, he spends $18 and gets all 9 rides. So, the total amount he spends is $30 vs. $18. So, the difference is $30 - $18 = $22. Wait,
