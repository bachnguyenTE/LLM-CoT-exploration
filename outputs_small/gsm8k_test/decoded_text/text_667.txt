Q: Sarah’s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this question about Sarah's basketball games. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Sarah's basketball games are 4 quarters, each quarter is 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for five minutes. I need to find out how long the entire game lasted.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the game is divided into four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes. So, if I just add up the time for each quarter, that should give me the total time without any extensions. Let me write that down.

Each quarter = 12 minutes
Number of quarters = 4

So, total time without extension = 12 minutes/quarter * 4 quarters = 48 minutes.

But wait, the last quarter was extended by five minutes because there was a tie. So, does that mean the last quarter took longer? Yes, it did. So, I need to add those extra five minutes to the total time.

So, total time = 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.

Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The game is 4 quarters, each 12 minutes. So, 4 times 12 is 48. Then, the last quarter was extended by five minutes, so 48 plus 5 is 53. That seems right.

Is there any chance that the extension was only for the last quarter, or did it affect the other quarters? The question says, "In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes." So, it specifically mentions the last quarter. So, the other quarters were still 12 minutes each. So, no, the other quarters weren't extended. So, only the last quarter was extended.

Therefore, the total time is 48 minutes plus 5 minutes, which is 53 minutes.

Wait, let me think again. Is 12 minutes per quarter correct? Yes, basketball games are usually 12 minutes per quarter. So, 4 quarters would be 48 minutes. Then, the last quarter was extended by five minutes, so 53 minutes in total.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. So, the answer should be 53 minutes.

**Final Answer**
The entire game lasted \boxed{53} minutes.

Sarah’s basketball games consist of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. Therefore, the total time for the game without any extensions is calculated as follows:

\[
4 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes per quarter} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

In the last quarter, the game was extended by 5 minutes. Thus, we add these 5 minutes to the total time:

\[
48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
\]

The entire game lasted \boxed{53} minutes.
