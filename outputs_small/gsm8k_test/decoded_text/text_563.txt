Okay, so James wants to buy birthday candles for his two sons. One of them is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Hmm, let me figure out how old the younger son is first. If the older one is 12, then subtracting 4 years gives me 8. So, the younger son is 8 years old. 

Now, James needs candles for both of them. I guess he needs one set of candles for each son. The problem says a pack of 5 candles costs $3. So, I need to figure out how many packs he needs in total and then calculate the cost.

First, let's see how many packs are needed. Each pack has 5 candles, so for each son, he needs a pack. Since there are two sons, that's 2 packs. Each pack costs $3, so 2 packs would cost 2 times $3. Let me write that down: 2 packs * $3 per pack = $6. 

Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. The older son is 12, the younger is 8. Each needs a pack of 5 candles. So, 5 candles for the older and 5 for the younger. That's 10 candles in total. Each pack is 5, so 10 divided by 5 is 2 packs. Yep, that's correct. So, 2 packs at $3 each is $6. 

I don't think there's any additional cost or tax mentioned, so I think $6 is the total amount James will spend on buy the candles for his two sons.

James needs 5 candles for each son, so he needs a total of 10 candles. Since each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3, he needs 2 packs. Therefore, the total cost is:

2 packs * $3 per pack = $6.

**Answer:** James spends $6 on candles.
