Q: Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Wayne and Bernadette going to the premiere of their movie. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem says that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. That means if Wayne arrives at the theater at a certain time, Bernadette needs to leave her place earlier so that she arrives 5 minutes earlier. 

Now, it also mentions that Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Hmm, so if it takes Wayne four minutes to get to the theater, how long does it take Bernadette? 

Let me break that down. If the drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes, then the drive from Bernadette's apartment, which is four times as long, would take 4 minutes multiplied by 4, which is 16 minutes. So, Bernadette's drive is 16 minutes, and Wayne's is 4 minutes. 

Wait, but the problem says that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne. So, if both of them are driving to the theater, and Bernadette's drive is longer, she needs to leave earlier to make up for the extra time and then arrive 5 minutes earlier. 

Let me think about the timing here. Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as T_w, which is 4 minutes. Then, Bernadette's drive time T_b is 4 * T_w, so that's 16 minutes. 

Now, if both of them are leaving at the same time, the difference in their travel times would be 16 - 4 = 12 minutes. So, Bernadette would arrive 12 minutes after Wayne. But she needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier. 

So, to make up for that 12-minute difference and then arrive 5 minutes earlier, Bernadette needs to leave 12 + 5 = 7 minutes earlier than Wayne. 

Wait, let me verify that. If Bernadette leaves 7 minutes earlier, then her driving time is 16 minutes, but she left 7 minutes earlier, so her total time from when she leaves her place to the theater is 16 - 7 = 9 minutes. 

Meanwhile, Wayne leaves his place at the hotel at the same time, takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, so he arrives at 4 minutes. 

But Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier, so she needs to arrive at 4 - 5 = -1 minute? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let me try another approach. Let's denote the time Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater as T. Then, since she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne, which arrives at T + 5 minutes. 

But both of them are driving to the theater, so the time it takes for each of them is their driving time. So, if T is the arrival time for Bernadette, then T + 5 is the arrival time for Wayne. 

But the driving times are different. So, the time Bernadette needs to leave her place is T - 16, and the time Wayne needs to leave his place is (T + 5) - 4. 

But since they leave at the same time, T -16 = (T + 5) - 4. Let me write that equation:

T - 16 = T + 5 - 4

Simplify the right side: T +1

So, T -16 = T +1

Subtract T from both sides: -16 = 1

Wait, that can't be right. That suggests -16 = 1, which is impossible. So, my approach must be wrong.

Maybe I need to think about the total time each person takes. 

Let me denote the time Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater as T. Then, since she wants to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne, who arrives at T + 5. 

But both of them are driving to the theater, so the time it takes for each of them is their driving time. So, the time Bernadette takes to drive is 16 minutes, and the time Wayne takes is 4 minutes. 

So, if Bernadette arrives at T, she left her place at T -16. 

Similarly, if Wayne arrives at T +5, he left his place at (T +5) -4 = T +1.

But since they leave at the same time, T -16 = T +1. 

Wait, that's the same equation as before, which
