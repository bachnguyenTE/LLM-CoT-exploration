Q: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, how many face masks does he use every 2 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine how many times Tyrion uses his face mask each day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out and he goes out three times a day, multiply 2 by 3 to get 6 face masks per day.

Next, calculate the number of face masks used over two days by multiplying the daily usage by 2. So, 6 face masks per day multiplied by 2 days equals 12 face masks in total.

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face mask changes per day:**
   
   - **Face mask changes per go out:** 2 times
   - **Number of go outs per day:** 3 times
   
   \[
   \text{Face masks per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used over 2 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Face masks in 2 days} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
