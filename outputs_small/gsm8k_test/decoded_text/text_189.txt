Q: Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?

Okay, so I have this problem here about three friends who went to the fair and spent some money. I need to figure out how much each of them paid if they agreed to split all the costs evenly. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says they spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. Hmm, wait, is that $20.25 or $20.25? I think it's $20.25 because it's written as $20.25. So, three tickets cost $20.25 in total. Then, they also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the food cost is $4.50 less than the ticket cost. Then, they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, two rides at $33 each. They agreed to split all the costs evenly. So, I need to find out the total amount they spent and then divide it by three.

Let me write down the information:

1. Cost of 3 tickets: $20.25
2. Cost of food: $4.50 less than the cost of tickets
3. Cost of 2 rides: each ride is $33, so two rides would be 2 * $33
4. Split the total cost equally among the three friends.

So, first, let me calculate the total cost of the tickets. It's $20.25. Then, the food cost is $4.50 less than that. So, food cost = tickets cost - $4.50.

Let me compute that:

Food cost = $20.25 - $4.50

Wait, hold on, is that correct? The problem says they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, yes, food cost is tickets cost minus $4.50.

So, $20.25 - $4.50. Let me subtract that.

20.25 minus 4.50. Hmm, 20 minus 4 is 16, and 0.25 minus 0.50. Wait, that can't be right because 0.25 is more than 0.50. Maybe I should write it as 20.25 - 4.50.

Let me do it step by step:

20.25
-4.50
--------
15.75

Wait, 20 minus 4 is 16, and 0.25 minus 0.50 is negative 0.25, so 16 - 0.25 is 15.75. So, food cost is $15.75.

Okay, so the food cost is $15.75.

Now, the rides: two different rides, each costing $33. So, 2 * $33.

33 * 2 is 66. So, rides cost $66.

Now, let me add up all the costs: tickets, food, rides.

Tickets: $20.25

Food: $15.75

Rides: $66.00

Total cost = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66.00

Let me add them step by step.

First, 20.25 + 15.75. Let's add the dollars and cents separately.

20 + 15 = 35

0.25 + 0.75 = 1.00

So, 35 + 1.00 = 36.00

Then, add the rides: 36.00 + 66.00

36 + 66 = 102

0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00

So, total is 102 + 0 = 102.00

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my addition.

Wait, 20.25 + 15.75 is 36.00, right? Because 20 +15 is 35, and 0.25 +0.75 is 1.00, so 35 +1.00 is 36.00.

Then, 36.00 +66.00. Let me add 36 +66=102, and 0.00 +0.00=0.00, so total is 102.00.

Wait, so total cost is $
