Q: A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where a car is on a road trip. It drives at 60 mph for 2 hours and then switches to 30 mph for 1 hour. The question is asking for the car's average speed during this entire trip. Hmm, average speed... I remember that average speed is different from just taking the average of the two speeds. Let me think about how to calculate it.

First, I recall that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find out how far the car traveled in total and then divide that by the total time it took for the trip. That makes sense because average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds; it's more about the overall distance covered over the overall time.

Alright, so let's break it down. The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. To find the distance covered in that first part, I can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

So, for the first part, that would be 60 mph multiplied by 2 hours. Let me write that out:

Distance1 = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Okay, so the car traveled 120 miles in the first two hours. Now, moving on to the second part of the trip. The car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. Again, using the same formula:

Distance2 = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Got it, so the car traveled an additional 30 miles in the next hour. Now, to find the total distance the car traveled during the entire trip, I need to add these two distances together.

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Alright, so the car went a total of 150 miles. Now, I need to find the total time the trip took. The first part took 2 hours and the second part took 1 hour, so adding those together:

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Perfect, so the total time is 3 hours. Now, to find the average speed, I take the total distance and divide it by the total time.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours

Let me do that division. 150 divided by 3 is 50. So, 150 divided by 3 is 50. Therefore, the average speed is 50 mph.

Wait, let me double-check that. 60 mph for 2 hours is 120 miles, and 30 mph for 1 hour is 30 miles. 120 plus 30 is 150 miles. 2 hours plus 1 hour is 3 hours. 150 divided by 3 is indeed 50. So, that seems correct.

I was a bit confused at first because sometimes people might just average the two speeds, which would be (60 + 30)/2 = 45 mph, but that's not the right approach. Instead, it's the total distance over total time. So, 50 mph is the correct average speed.

Just to make sure, let me visualize the trip. The car spends twice as long driving at a higher speed, 60 mph, so it covers more ground in the first part. Then, it slows down to 30 mph for the remaining hour. So, the average speed is somewhere between 30 and 60, but closer to 50. That makes sense because the car spends more time at the higher speed.

Another way to think about it is that the car spends 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph. So, the average speed is like a weighted average. The first part is weighted more because it took twice as long. So, the average speed is closer to 60 than to 30, but not by much. 50 would be halfway, but since it's 2:1, it's closer to 60. Wait, 50 is actually 50, which is 50. So, 50 is 50, which is 50. So, 50 is 50, which is 50. So, 50 is the correct average speed.

I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, the average speed is 50 mph.

**Final Answer**
The car's average speed during the trip is \boxed{50} mph.

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.
