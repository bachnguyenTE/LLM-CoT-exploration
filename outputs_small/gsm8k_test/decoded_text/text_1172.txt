Q: Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?

Okay, so Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds every day while she's eating lunch. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs. Then, each day after that, from Tuesday to Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before. The question is, how many clouds will she have counted in total from Monday to Friday?

Hmm, let me break this down. So, she starts on Monday with 3 puffs. Then, each subsequent day, the number doubles. That means each day, the count is 2 times the previous day's count. So, it's like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 each time.

Let me write down the days and the number of puffs she counts each day. Maybe that will help me visualize it better.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Wait, so each day, the number of puffs is doubling. So, starting from 3, each day it's multiplied by 2. So, the counts are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

Now, to find the total number of clouds she has counted across all five days, I need to add up these numbers.

Let me add them one by one:

- Monday: 3
- Tuesday: 6, so total so far: 3 + 6 = 9
- Wednesday: 12, total: 9 +12 = 21
- Thursday:24, total:21 +24 =45
- Friday:48, total:45 +48 =93

Wait, hold on, 3 +6 is 9, plus 12 is 21, plus24 is 45, plus48 is 93. So, the total is 93 puffs.

But let me double-check that because sometimes when I add sequentially, I might make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each day's count is double the previous day, it's a geometric progression with first term a = 3 and common ratio r = 2.

The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1). Here, n is 5 days.

So, plugging in the values: S_5 = 3*(2^5 -1)/(2 -1) = 3*(32 -1)/1 = 3*31 =93.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each day's count is 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. So, adding them up:

3 +6 is 9, 9 +12 is 21, 21 +24 is 45, 45 +48 is 93. So, 93.

Wait, but 3 +6 is 9, 9 +12 is 21, 21 +24 is 45, 45 +48 is 93. So, 93 is the total.

But let me think again. Is that correct? Because sometimes when I add sequentially, I might have miscounted.

Wait, 3 on Monday, 6 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 24 on Thursday, 48 on Friday. So, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48.

Let me add them in pairs to see if that helps. 3 +48 is 51, 6 +24 is 30, and 12 is left alone. So, 51 +30 is 81, plus12 is 93. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 3*(1 +2 +4 +8 +16). Wait, that might complicate things.

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Maybe I can think of the total as 3*(1 +2 +4 +8 +16). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 1 +2 +4 +8 is 15, and 16 is 16, so 15 +16 is 21, which is not
