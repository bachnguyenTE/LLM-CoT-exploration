Q: Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Tom's ship. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He's sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM. Then he travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The question is asking how long it takes him to get back. 

Wait, hold on. The problem doesn't specify how far Tom is from his starting point when he starts sailing back. That seems important. Without knowing the distance, I can't calculate the time it takes to get back. Maybe I missed something? Let me read it again.

"Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM. He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph. How long does it take him to get back?"

Hmm, okay, so the time he spends sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours, right? Because from 1 to 2 is one hour, 2 to 3 is another, and 3 to 4 is the third. So that's 3 hours total. 

But the problem doesn't mention the distance from his starting point. So maybe the distance is the same both ways? Or is there more information I'm missing? Let me think. If he's sailing back, the distance should be the same, but the speed is different. So maybe the distance is the same, but we don't know it. 

Wait, maybe the problem is implying that he sails back the same distance he went? If that's the case, then we can calculate the time based on the speed. But the problem doesn't specify the distance. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the distance is the same as the distance he traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM? But the problem doesn't specify the distance. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that the distance is the same both ways? Or perhaps the problem is missing some information.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says he sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, so that's 3 hours. Then he travels back at 6 mph. So, if we assume that the distance is the same, then the time it takes to come back would be distance divided by 6 mph. But since we don't know the distance, maybe we can express the time in terms of the distance.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the time, so maybe it's expecting a numerical answer. Hmm, perhaps the distance is the same as the distance he traveled in 3 hours at 10 mph. Let me calculate that.

So, distance = speed × time. So, from 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours. So, distance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles. So, he is 30 miles away from his starting point when he turns around.

Then, when he comes back, he's traveling at 6 mph. So, the time it takes to come back would be distance divided by speed, which is 30 miles divided by 6 mph. That would be 5 hours. So, it takes him 5 hours to get back.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, maybe the answer is 5 hours. But let me double-check.

He sails for 3 hours at 10 mph, so he covers 30 miles. Then, he turns around and goes back at 6 mph. So, time = distance / speed = 30 / 6 = 5 hours. Yeah, that makes sense.

But wait, is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe the distance is different? Or maybe the time is different? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the distance, so I think the assumption that the distance is the same both ways is necessary to solve it. Otherwise, we can't find the time without knowing the distance.

So, I think the answer is 5 hours. Let me write that down.

**Final Answer**
The time it takes Tom to get back is \boxed{5} hours.

Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. The distance he travels during this time is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \,0000 = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

When Tom turns around, he travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time it takes for him to get back is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3
