Q: Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Johnny picking up some toys, and I need to figure out how many blocks he picks up in total. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room. He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?"

Wait, hold on. The problem mentions "lego boxed set" and "blocks." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo? Because a box of Legos usually has pieces, not blocks. Maybe it's supposed to say " Legos" instead of "blocks." Let me check the original problem again.

"Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room. He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?"

Hmm, okay, so maybe it's a mix-up between Legos and blocks. But Legos are usually made of plastic and are in boxes, not blocks. So perhaps the problem is referring to Legos? Or maybe it's a translation issue. I'll proceed with the assumption that it's Legos, as that's the more common term, and maybe the "blocks" part is a mistake.

So, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Johnny has three types of toys:

1. A box with 500 pieces.
2. Another box that has 3 times more pieces than the first one.
3. A third box that has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one.

He picks up all the Legos, so we need to find the total number of Legos he picks up.

Let me write down the given numbers:

- First box: 500 pieces.
- Second box: 3 times more than the first box.
- Third box: 1/4 the number of pieces as the first box.

So, let's compute each box's number of Legos.

First box is straightforward: 500 pieces.

Second box: 3 times more than the first box. So, that would be 3 multiplied by 500.

Third box: 1/4 of the first box, which is 1/4 of 500.

So, let's compute each of these.

First box: 500.

Second box: 3 * 500. Let me calculate that. 3 * 500 is 1500.

Third box: (1/4) * 500. Let me compute that. 500 divided by 4 is 125.

So, now, we have three boxes: 500, 1500, and 125.

To find the total number of Legos Johnny picks up, we need to add these three numbers together.

So, total Legos = 500 + 1500 + 125.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 500 + 1500. That's 2000.

Then, 2000 + 125. Let me add 125 to 2000. 2000 + 125 is 2125, so 2000 + 125 is 2125.

Wait, hold on. 2000 + 125 is 2125? Let me check that again.

2000 + 100 is 2100, and then +25 is 2125. Yes, that's correct.

So, total Legos Johnny picks up is 2125.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when adding large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.

First box: 500.

Second box: 3 times 500. 3*500 is 1500. That seems right.

Third box: 1/4 of 500. 500 divided by 4 is 125. That also seems correct.

Adding them up: 500 + 1500 is 2000, plus 125 is 2125. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but 500 + 1
