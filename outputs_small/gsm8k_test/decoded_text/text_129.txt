Q: A hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Okay, so I have this problem about a hospital's profit from patient visits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. I need to find out how much profit the hospital makes from these visits.

Hmm, profit usually means total revenue minus total costs. So, I think I need to calculate both the total revenue the hospital makes from all the patient visits and the total costs they incur for these visits. Then, subtract the costs from the revenue to get the profit.

Let me break it down. 

First, let's find the total revenue. The hospital charges each patient $200 an hour. But wait, each patient is seen for 24 minutes. So, I need to figure out how much the hospital charges per patient. Since 24 minutes is a fraction of an hour, I should convert that into hours.

24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, each patient is charged for 0.4 hours at $200 per hour. Let me calculate that.

$200 per hour * 0.4 hours = $22.4 * 200? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 220? Wait, no, 200 is the charge per hour. So, 200 * 0.4.

Let me compute that: 220 * 0.4 is 88, but wait, 200 is 200, so 200 * 0.4 is 88. So, each patient is charged $88.

Wait, hold on, 200 * 0.4: 200 * 0.4 is 80, and 20 * 0.4 is 8, so total is 88. So, yes, $88 per patient.

So, each patient is $88. Now, how many patients are there? 500 a day. So, total revenue is 500 * 88.

Let me compute that: 500 * 80 is 40,000, and 500 *8 is 4,000. So, 40,000 + 4,000 = 44,000. So, total revenue is $44,000 per day.

Okay, that's the revenue. Now, the cost. The doctors charge $150 an hour. So, I need to figure out how much the hospital spends on their staff per day.

Wait, each patient is seen for 24 minutes, but how many doctors are there? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the number of doctors. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?"

Wait, so maybe the number of doctors isn't given. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I need to assume that each doctor can see multiple patients in a day? Or perhaps the number of hours each doctor works is the same?

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to assume that each doctor works the same number of hours, but without knowing how many doctors there are, it's hard to compute the total cost.

Wait, hold on, maybe the $150 is per hour per doctor, and the number of doctors is not given. Hmm, that seems like a missing piece of information. Maybe I need to make an assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the number of hours each doctor works is the same, but without knowing how many doctors there are, I can't compute the total cost. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe the $150 is per hour per patient? But no, the problem says "the doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital." So, that's per doctor per hour. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the number of hours each doctor works is the same, but without knowing how many doctors, I can't compute the total cost. Hmm, this is a problem.
