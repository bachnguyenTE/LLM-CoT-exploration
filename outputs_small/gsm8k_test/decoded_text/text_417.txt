Q: Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip. Let me break this down step by step because it seems a bit complicated at first glance, but if I take it one day at a time, I can manage it.

First, let's parse the information given:

1. **First 4 days:** Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
2. **Next two days:** He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days.
3. **Next day:** He wasn't traveling at all.
4. **Second week:** He made 300 kilometers every day.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I understand the structure here. It says "the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days." So, the next two days are after the first four days, and on the next day, he wasn't traveling. Then, the second week is another set of days, and he traveled 300 km each day.

So, let me map this out:

- **First 4 days:** 200 km/day
- **Next 2 days:** 30% of the first 4 days' total
- **Next day:** 0 km
- **Second week (which is 7 days):** 300 km/day

Wait, hold on. Is the second week 7 days? The problem says "two weeks-long trip through Europe," but it doesn't specify how the days are divided. It says "the first 4 days," then "the next two days," then "the next day," and then "the second week." So, the second week is 7 days, right? So, the trip is 14 days in total, divided into:

1. First 4 days
2. Next 2 days
3. Next 1 day
4. Second week (7 days)

So, 4 + 2 + 1 +7 = 14 days. That makes sense.

So, let's compute each segment step by step.

**First 4 days:**
He traveled 200 km each day. So, total distance for these 4 days is 200 km/day * 4 days.

Let me calculate that: 200 * 4 = 800 km.

**Next two days:**
He traveled 30% of the distance over the first four days. The first four days total 800 km, so 30% of 800 km.

Calculating 30% of 800: 0.30 * 800 = 240 km.

So, over the next two days, he traveled 240 km in total (240 km over two days).

**Next day:**
He wasn't traveling at all. So, 0 km.

**Second week:**
He made 300 km every day. Since the second week is 7 days, total distance is 300 km/day *7 days.

Calculating that: 300 *7 = 2100 km.

Now, let's add up all these distances to get the total.

First 4 days: 800 km

Next two days: 240 km

Next day: 0 km

Second week: 2100 km

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100

Let me compute this step by step.

800 + 240 = 1040

1040 + 0 = 1040

1040 + 2100 = 3150

Wait, 1040 + 2100 is 3150? Let me check that again.

1040 + 2100:

1000 + 2000 = 3000

40 + 10 = 54

So, 3000 + 54 = 3054. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, 1040 + 2100.

Wait, 1040 + 2100.

Wait, 1040 + 2100 is 3150? Wait, 1000 + 2000 is 3000, 40 + 100 is 50, so 3000 + 50 = 3050. Wait, no, 1040 + 2100.

Wait, 1040 + 2100:

10
