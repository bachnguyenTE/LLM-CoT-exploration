Q: The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Brianna and her family when their power goes out. They gather all their candles and flashlights to use. Let me try to figure out how many candles and flashlights they have in total.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are 8 rooms in the house, and 4 people living there, including Brianna. So, each person has their own flashlight, right? And there are two flashlights for each room. Hmm, so that means each room has two flashlights, one for each person. So, 8 rooms times 2 flashlights each would be 16 flashlights in total. That seems straightforward.

Now, about the candles. They have a variety of candles available. It says there are 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. So, let me break that down.

First, half the rooms would be 8 rooms divided by 2, which is 4 rooms. So, for these 4 rooms, each has 4 small candles. Then, the other half, which is also 4 rooms, each has 5 medium candles. So, let me calculate the total number of small candles and medium candles separately.

For the small candles: 4 small candles per room times 4 rooms. That would be 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.

For the medium candles: 5 medium candles per room times 4 rooms. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 medium candles.

So, adding those together, the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Wait, hold on, 5 * 4 is 20? That seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 5 medium candles each for 4 rooms: 5*4=20. Yeah, that's correct. So, 16 small and 20 medium, totaling 36 candles.

So, to recap, they have 36 candles and 16 flashlights (since 8 rooms * 2 flashlights each is 16). So, the total number of items they have is 36 candles + 16 flashlights = 52 items.

Wait, but the question is asking how many candles and flashlights they are using when the lights go out. So, I think that's just the total number of candles and flashlights they have, which is 36 + 16 = 52.

But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says they have a variety of candles; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. So, each room has two flashlights, and each person has their own flashlight. So, 4 small candles per room for 4 rooms, and 5 medium candles per room for the other 4 rooms.

So, 4 small candles per room: 4*4=16 small candles.

5 medium candles per room: 5*4=20 medium candles.

Total candles: 16 +20=36? Wait, no, 16+20 is 36. Wait, 4*4 is 16, 5*4 is 20, so 16+20=36. Yes, that's correct.

And the flashlights: 8 rooms, 2 per room, so 16 flashlights.

So, total items: 36 candles +16 flashlights=52.

Wait, 36+16=42? Wait, no, 36+16=42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 52? Wait, 36+16 is 52? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, no, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 52? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 52. Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is 52? Wait, 36+16 is 42? Wait, 36+16 is
