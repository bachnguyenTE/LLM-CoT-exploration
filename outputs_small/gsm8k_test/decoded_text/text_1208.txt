Q: Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought the magazines. If she bought the magazines at $72, what is her profit?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. She bought them at $72, and I need to find her profit. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. So, profit = selling price - cost price. In this case, the cost price is $72, but I need to figure out what the selling price is.

The problem says she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Is it 11/8 of the cost price, or is it 11/8 of something else? Let me read it again: "Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought the magazines." So, it's 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, that would be 11/8 times the cost price.

So, the selling price (SP) is (11/8) * cost price. But wait, 11/8 is more than 1, so that would mean she's selling them for more than she bought them. That makes sense because profit is positive. So, SP = (11/8) * 72.

Let me calculate that. 11/8 is the same as 1.125, right? So, 1.125 multiplied by 72. Hmm, let me do that step by step.

First, 72 divided by 8 is 9, because 8 times 9 is 72. So, 1/8 of 72 is 9. Then, 11/8 is 1 + 1/8, so that would be 72 + 9 = 81. So, the selling price is $81. Wait, that seems high. $81? That's like $81.00. Is that realistic? Maybe, but let me check my math.

Alternatively, maybe I should do it as fractions. 11/8 of 72 is (11/8)*72. Let me compute that. 72 divided by 8 is 9, so 1/8 is 9, so 11/8 is 9 + 9 = 18? Wait, that can't be right because 11/8 is 1.375, so 1.375 times 72.

Wait, maybe I confused the fractions. Let me think again. 11/8 is equal to 1 and 3/8. So, 1 times 72 is 72, and 3/8 of 72 is... 72 divided by 8 is 9, so 3/8 is 27.25. So, 72 + 27.25 is 99.25. So, the selling price is $99.25.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, 11/8 of 72 is 99.25. So, the selling price is $99.25. Then, her cost price is $72. So, profit is 99.25 - 72. Let me subtract that.

99.25 minus 72. So, 99.25 minus 70 is 29.25, and then minus 2 more is 27.25. So, her profit is $27.25.

Wait, that seems like a lot of profit. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 11/8 of 72. 72 divided by 8 is 9, so 11/8 is 9 + 9/8. 9/8 is 1.125, so 9 + 1.125 is 10.125. So, 11/8 of 72 is 10.125. Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, no, 11/8 is 1 + 1/8, so 1 times 72 is 72, and 1/8 is 9, so 72 + 9 is 81. So, 81. So, that's $81.00. Wait, that's $81.00. Wait, no, 11/8 is 1.125, so 1.125 times 72 is 81.25. So, 81.25.

Wait
