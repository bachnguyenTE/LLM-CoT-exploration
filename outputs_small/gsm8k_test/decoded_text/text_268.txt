A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a real estate agent who buys newspaper and television ads. Let me try to figure out how much he spent in total. Hmm, the problem says he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. I need to find the total amount he spent on all the ads.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to calculate how much he spent on the newspaper ads separately and then do the same for the television ads. After that, I can add both amounts together to get the total cost. That makes sense because he bought two different types of ads, so their costs should be separate.

Starting with the newspaper ads. He spent $5 on each one, and he bought 50 of them. So, to find the total cost for the newspaper ads, I should multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads. That would be 5 dollars times 50. Let me write that out: 5 * 50. Hmm, 5 times 50. Well, 5 times 5 is 25, and since it's 50, that would be 250. So, he spent $250 on the newspaper ads. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 50 times 5 is 250, so yes, that's correct.

Now, moving on to the television ads. He spent $75 on each one, and he bought 15 of them. So, similar to the newspaper ads, I need to multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads. That would be 75 * 15. Hmm, 75 times 15. Let me think about how to calculate that. Maybe break it down: 75 times 10 is 750, and 75 times 5 is 375. Then, add those two together: 750 + 375. Let me add that up. 750 plus 300 is 1050, and then plus 75 is 1125. So, he spent $125 on the television ads.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 75 times 15. 15 is 10 plus 5. So, 75 times 10 is 750, and 75 times 5 is 375. Adding those together, 750 + 375 is indeed 1125. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right because 75 times 15 is 1125? Wait, no, 75 times 10 is 750, 75 times 5 is 375, so 750 + 375 is 1125. But earlier, I thought it was 125. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check my initial calculation.

Wait, 75 times 15. Maybe I did that wrong. Let me write it out:

75
times15
-------
Multiply 75 by 5: 375
Multiply 75 by 10: 750
Add them together: 375 + 750 = 1125

Oh, okay, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 125. It's actually 1125. So, the total for the television ads is $1125.

Wait, so that means I was wrong before. So, the newspaper ads cost $250 and the television ads cost $1125. So, to find the total amount spent, I need to add these two together.

So, 250 + 1125. Let me add those. 250 + 1125. Let's break it down: 200 + 1000 is 1200, 50 + 125 is 175. So, 1200 + 175 is 1375. So, the total amount spent is $1375.

Wait, let me verify that addition. 250 is 250, and 1125 is 1125. So, 250 + 1125. Let's add the units place: 5 + 5 is 10. Carry over 1. Then, tens place: 5 + 2 is 7, plus the carried over 1 is 8. Hundreds place
