Q: If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Raymond, Sarah, and David doing laundry. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Hmm, so if I let the amount of laundry Sarah does be a certain number, then Raymond's amount would be half of that. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the amount of laundry Sarah does as S. So, S is 400 pounds, as given. Then, Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so Raymond's amount, let's call it R, would be R = S / 2. Since S is 400, R would be 400 / 2. Let me calculate that. 400 divided by 2 is 200. So, Raymond does 220 pounds of laundry.

Next, the problem says that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Okay, so if I let the amount of laundry David does be D, then Sarah's amount is 4 times that. So, S = 4 * D. We know S is 400, so 400 = 4 * D. To find D, I need to divide both sides by 4. So, D = 400 / 4. Let me compute that. 400 divided by 4 is 105. So, David does 105 pounds of laundry.

Now, the question is asking for the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. So, I need to subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does. That would be R - D. We have R as 220 and D as 105. So, 220 - 105. Let me do that subtraction. 220 minus 105. Hmm, 220 minus 100 is 120, and then minus 5 more is 115. So, the difference is 115 pounds.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Sarah does 400 pounds. Raymond does half of that, which is 220. David does 400 divided by 4, which is 105. Then, 220 minus 105 is indeed 115. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's it. So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 115 pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 115 pounds.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the amount of laundry Sarah does.
   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry Raymond does.
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - Raymond does half as much as Sarah: \( R = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Sarah does 4 times as much as David: \( S = 4D \).

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Given \( S = 400 \) pounds.
   - Calculate \( R \): \( R = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.
   - Calculate \( D \): \( D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds.

4. **Find the Difference:**
   - Difference = \( R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

Wait, hold on! There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me re-examine the calculations.

**Revised Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the amount of laundry Sarah does.
   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry Raymond does.
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - Raymond does half as much as Sarah: \( R = \frac{S}{2} \).
   - Sarah does 4 times as much as David: \( S = 4D \).

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Given \( S = 400 \) pounds.
   - Calculate \( R \): \( R = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.
   - Calculate \( D \): \( D = \frac{400}{4} = 105 \) pounds.

4. **Find the Difference:**
   - Difference = \( R - D = 200 - 1
