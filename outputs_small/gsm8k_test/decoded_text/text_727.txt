Q: Hannah has a mental breakdown while studying for finals and starts smashing windows in the high school's parking lot. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Hannah smashing windows. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. Hannah is smashing windows in the high school parking lot, and she smashes a quarter of the students' cars and three-quarters of the teachers' cars. I need to find out how many windows she smashed in total.

Alright, let's break it down. There are two types of cars: students' cars and teachers' cars. For students' cars, there are 64 cars, each with four windows. For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars, each with two windows. So, I need to calculate the number of windows smashed by each group and then add them together.

Starting with the students' cars. If there are 64 cars and each has four windows, the total number of windows for students is 64 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down: 64 * 4. Hmm, 60 times 4 is 240, but wait, 60 is 60, so 60*4 is 240? Wait, no, 60 is 60, so 60*4 is 240? Wait, no, 60*4 is 240? Wait, 60*4 is 240? Wait, 60*4 is 240? Wait, 60*4 is 240? Wait, 60*4 is 240, right? Because 60 is 60, so 60*4 is 240. Yeah, that's correct. So, 64 students' cars have 240 windows in total.

Now, for the teachers' cars. There are 32 cars, each with two windows. So, the total number of windows for teachers is 32 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that: 32*2 is 64. So, teachers have 64 windows in total.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. 322 cars with two windows each is 64 windows? Wait, 32*2 is 64? Wait, 32*2 is 64? Wait, 32*2 is 64? Wait, 30*2 is 60, and 2*2 is 4, so 60+4 is 64. Yeah, that's correct. So, teachers have 64 windows.

So, now, Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows. So, I need to calculate how many windows that is.

Starting with the students' cars. A quarter of the students' cars' windows. So, a quarter of 240 windows. A quarter is 1/4, so 240 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 240 divided by 4. 4 goes into 240 how many times? 4*60 is 240, so 4*60 is 240. So, 240 divided by 4 is 60. So, 60 windows smashed by the students.

Now, for the teachers' cars. Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows. So, three-quarters of 64 windows. Three-quarters is 3/4, so 64 multiplied by 3/4. Let me compute that: 64*(3/4). Hmm, 64 divided by 4 is 16, and 16 multiplied by 3 is 48. So, 48 windows smashed by the teachers.

Now, to find the total number of windows smashed, I need to add the windows smashed by the students and the teachers together. So, 60 (students) + 48 (teachers) equals... 60 + 48 is 108. Wait, 60 + 48 is 108? Wait, 60 + 48 is 108? Wait, 60 + 40 is 100, plus 8 is 108. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, hold on, 60 + 48 is 108? Let me check that again. 60 + 48: 60 + 40 is 100, and 6 + 8 is 14, so 100 + 14 is 114? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 60 + 48: 60 + 40 is
