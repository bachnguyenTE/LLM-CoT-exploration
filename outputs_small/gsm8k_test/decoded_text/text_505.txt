Q: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Okay, so Frederick is making popsicles and wants to save money by making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2x8 piece of wood. He has $24 to spend on wood. A 2x4 costs $4, and a 2x8 costs $6. The question is asking, what's the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which type of wood is cheaper per stick. So, a 2x4 gives 220 sticks for $4, and a 2x8 gives 440 sticks for $6. Let me calculate the cost per stick for each.

For the 2x4: 220 sticks for $4. So, 220 divided by 4 is 55.55 dollars per stick. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. 220 divided by 4 is 55.5 dollars per stick. Hmm, that's a lot. For the 2x8, 440 sticks for $6. So, 440 divided by 6 is approximately 73.33 dollars per stick. That's even more expensive. So, clearly, the 2x4 is cheaper per stick.

Wait, but the problem says he can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 and 400 sticks from a 2x8. So, maybe the numbers are different? Let me check the original problem again.

Oh, wait, the problem says: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2x8 piece of wood. So, 200 sticks from 2x4 and 400 sticks from 2x8. So, 200 sticks for $4 and 400 sticks for $6.

So, that changes things. So, 200 sticks for $4, which is 5 dollars per stick, and 400 sticks for $6, which is 1.5 dollars per stick. So, clearly, the 2x8 is cheaper per stick.

So, the problem is asking, if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2x8, how many sticks can he make with $24.

So, first, let's figure out how many 2x8 pieces he can buy with $24. Each 2x8 costs $6, so how many can he buy?

He has $24. Each 2x8 is $6. So, 24 divided by 6 is 4. So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2x8 wood.

Each 2x8 gives 400 sticks. So, 4 times 400 is 1600 sticks.

Wait, but is that all? Or can he combine different sizes?

Wait, the problem says he can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 and 400 sticks from a 2x8. So, he can buy multiple 2x4s and 2x8s, but each 2x4 costs $4 and each 2x8 costs $6.

So, he has $24. So, he can buy multiple 2x4s and 2x8s, but the total cost can't exceed $24.

So, the problem is to maximize the number of sticks, which is 200 per 2x4 and 400 per 2x8.

So, he can buy x number of 2x4s and y number of 2x8s, such that 4x + 6y ≤24, and we need to maximize 200x +400y.

So, this is a linear programming problem, but since x and y have to be integers, we can solve it by trying different combinations.

So, let's see. Let me define variables:

Let x = number of 2x4 pieces.

Let y = number of 2x8 pieces.

Constraints:

4x + 6y ≤24

x ≥0, y≥0, integers.

Objective: Maximize 200x +400y.

So, we need to find x and y such that 4x +6y ≤24, and 200x +400y is as large as possible.

So, let's see. Let's try to maximize y first, since each 2x8 gives
