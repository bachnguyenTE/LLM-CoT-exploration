Q: The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?

Okay, so I have this problem about the Great Pyramids and the sun's angle. Let me try to visualize it first. The question says that the pyramids are sitting at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from Sahir's house, which is at the entrance. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours. I need to find how many degrees from the ground the sun will be after 10 hours.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the Great Pyramid of Giza is a huge structure. I think the angle of 32 degrees is the angle between the base and the sides of the pyramid. So, if I imagine looking down from the top of the pyramid, the angle between the ground and the side is 32 degrees. That means the pyramid is tilted at 32 degrees relative to the horizontal.

Now, the sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour. So, every hour, the sun's elevation increases by 5 degrees. It starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is the highest point, and moves upward for 10 hours. So, the total elevation change is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees. Wait, but the pyramid itself is tilted at 32 degrees. So, does that mean the sun's elevation relative to the ground is 32 degrees plus 50 degrees? That would be 82 degrees. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think again. The sun is moving relative to Sahir's house, which is at the entrance. So, the sun's elevation angle from the ground is increasing at 5 degrees per hour. But the pyramid is tilted at 32 degrees from the ground. So, when the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, it's at 32 degrees from the ground. Then, as the sun moves upward, the angle from the ground increases by 5 degrees each hour.

Wait, so the sun's angle relative to the ground is 32 degrees plus 5 degrees per hour. So, after 10 hours, it would be 32 + 5*10 = 82 degrees. But that seems like a lot. Is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe the angle of the pyramid is 32 degrees, so the sun is 32 degrees above the ground at the tip. Then, as the sun moves upward, it's moving away from the pyramid. So, the sun's angle from the ground is 32 degrees plus 5 degrees per hour. So, after 10 hours, it's 32 + 50 = 82 degrees. Hmm, that seems to make sense.

But wait, is the sun moving at 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house, or relative to the pyramid? The question says, "the sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house." So, it's moving relative to Sahir's house, which is at the entrance. So, the sun's elevation angle from the ground is increasing at 5 degrees per hour.

But the pyramid itself is tilted at 32 degrees. So, when the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, it's 32 degrees from the ground. Then, as the sun moves upward, it's moving away from the pyramid, so the angle from the ground increases by 5 degrees each hour.

So, after 10 hours, the sun's angle from the ground is 32 + 5*10 = 82 degrees. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think about the direction. If the sun is moving upward from Sahir's house, which is at the entrance, and the pyramid is tilted at 32 degrees, then the sun is moving away from the pyramid. So, the angle from the ground increases as the sun moves away from the pyramid.

So, starting at 32 degrees, adding 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours, so 32 + 50 = 82 degrees. So, the sun will be 82 degrees from the ground after 10 hours.

But let me make sure. Maybe I should model this with some trigonometry.

Let me consider the sun's elevation angle. The sun's elevation angle is measured from the horizon. So, if the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground, that means the sun's elevation angle is 32 degrees. Then, as the sun moves upward, the elevation angle increases by 5 degrees each hour.

So, after t hours, the elevation angle is 32 + 5t degrees. So, after 10 hours, it's 3
