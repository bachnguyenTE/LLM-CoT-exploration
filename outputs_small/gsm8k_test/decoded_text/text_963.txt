Q: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch all the Pokemon together. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. The problem gives me some relationships between how many each of them has caught. I need to figure out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the information given:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.

I think the best way to approach this is by setting up some variables for each person's catch. Let me assign variables to each person:

Let A = number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

Let S = number of Pokemon Stan has caught.

Let D = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

Now, according to the problem:

1. A + S + D = 339. That's the total number of Pokemon caught.

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. So, A = S + 5.

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, S = 4D - 13.

Alright, so now I have three equations:

1. A + S + D = 339

2. A = S + 5

3. S = 4D -13

So, I can substitute the second equation into the first one, and then substitute the third equation into that. Let me do that step by step.

First, substitute A from equation 2 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + S + D = 339

Simplify that:

S + 5 + S + D = 339

Combine like terms:

2S + D + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2S + D = 334

So, equation 4: 2S + D = 334

Now, from equation 3, we have S = 4D -13. Let me substitute that into equation 4.

So, 2*(4D -13) + D = 334

Let me compute that:

First, multiply out the 2:

8D -6 + D = 334

Combine like terms:

8D + D -6 = 334

So, 9D -6 = 334

Add 6 to both sides:

9D = 334 +6

9D = 340

Divide both sides by 9:

D = 340 /9

Wait, 340 divided by 9. Let me compute that.

9*37=333, so 340-333=7, so D=37 and 7/9. Hmm, that's a fraction. But the number of Pokemon caught should be a whole number, right? So, that suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me check my steps again.

Starting from the beginning:

1. A + S + D = 339

2. A = S +5

3. S = 4D -13

Substituting A into equation 1:

(S +5) + S + D = 339

Which is 2S + D +5 = 339

So, 2S + D = 334. That seems correct.

Then, substituting S =4D -13 into 2S + D =334:

2*(4D -13) + D =334

Which is 8D -26 + D =334

So, 9D -26 =334

Then, 9D =334 +26=360

Wait, hold on, 334 +26 is 360? Wait, 334 +26 is 360? Wait, 334 +26 is 360? Wait, 334 +26 is 360? Wait, 334 +26 is 340? Wait, no, 334 +26 is 340? Wait, 334 +20 is 354, plus 6 is 360. Wait, no, 334 +26 is 340? Wait, 334 +26 is 340? Wait, no, 334 +26 is 340? Wait, 3
