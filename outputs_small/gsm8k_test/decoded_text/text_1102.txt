Q: Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?

Okay, so I need to figure out Sheila's new credit card balance after all these transactions. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, Sheila started with a charge of $85.00 on her credit card. Then she returned an item that cost $15.00. Hmm, so I think that means her balance will decrease by $15.00 because she's returning it. So, I should subtract $15.00 from $85.00. Let me write that down:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Okay, so after returning the item, her balance is $70.00. 

Next, she bought two things on sale: a frying pan that was 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. I need to calculate the discounted prices for each and then add them to her current balance.

Starting with the frying pan: 20% off $20.00. To find 20% of $20.00, I can multiply 20% by $20.00. 

20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal, so:

0.20 * $20.00 = $4.000

So, the frying pan is $4.00 off. That means the sale price is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Alright, the frying pan is now $16.00. 

Now, the towels were 10% off $30.00. Let me calculate 10% of $30.00.

10% is 0.10 in decimal, so:

0.10 * $30.00 = $3.30

So, the towels are $3.30 off. Therefore, the sale price is:

$30.00 - $3.30 = $26.70

Got it, the towels are now $26.70. 

Now, I need to add these two discounted amounts to her current balance of $70.00.

So, adding the fried pan and towels:

$16.00 + $26.70 = $42.70

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in adding. Let me recalculate:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $26.70 (towels) = $42.70? That can't be right because $16 + $26 is $42, and then plus $0.70 is $42.70. Hmm, but that seems too low. Let me verify the individual amounts.

Wait, the fried pan was $20.00 with 20% off, which is $4.00 off, so $16.00. The towels were $30.00 with 10% off, which is $3.30 off, so $26.70. Wait, no, $30.00 minus $3.30 is $26.70, not $26.70. So, $16.00 + $26.70 is $42.70. 

Wait, so $16.00 + $26.70 is $42.70. So, adding that to her current balance of $70.00:

$70.00 + $42.70 = $112.70

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me go back step by step.

She started with $85.00. She returned an item worth $15.00, so subtract that: 85 - 15 = 70. So, $70.00.

Then, she bought the fried pan: 20% off $20.00. 20% of 20 is 0.40, so 20% of 20 is 4.00. So, 20% off is $4.000, so the price is 20 - 4 = 16. So, $16.00.

Then, towels: 10% off $30.00. 10% of 30 is 3.30, so 10%
