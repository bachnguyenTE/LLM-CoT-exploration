Q: Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. I need to find out how many copies Harald sold. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me try to understand the problem. It says Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald. So if I let Harald's sales be a certain number, then Marilyn's would be 10 times that number. Then together, their sales add up to 88,000. So, I think I can set up an equation to solve this.

Let me denote Harald's sales as H. Then, Marilyn's sales would be 10 times H, which is 10H. Together, their sales are H + 10H, which is 11H. And this total is 88,000. So, 11H = 88,000. Therefore, H = 88,000 divided by 11.

Wait, let me write that down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Let H be the number of copies Harald sold. Then Marilyn sold 10H copies. Together, H + 10H = 11H. So, 11H = 88,000. Therefore, H = 88,000 / 11.

Now, I need to compute 88,000 divided by 11. Let me do that division.

First, 11 goes into 88 how many times? 11 times 8 is 88, so that's 8 times. Then, there's a decimal point, so 88 divided by 11 is 8.0. Then, we have 000 left over? Wait, no, 88,000 divided by 11.

Wait, maybe I should write it out more carefully.

88,000 divided by 111. Wait, no, 11H is 88,000. So, 11H = 88,000. So, H = 88,000 /11.

Let me compute 88,000 divided by 11.

11 times 8 is 88, so 8 times 11 is 88. So, 88,000 divided by 11 is 8,000. Wait, that can't be right because 11 times 8,000 is 88,000. So, H is 8,000.

Wait, so Harald sold 8,000 copies. Let me check that.

If Harald sold 8,000, then Marilyn sold 10 times that, which is 80,000. Together, 8,000 + 80,000 is 88,000. That adds up correctly.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says 88,000 copies combined. So, 8,000 plus 80,000 is 88,000. That's correct.

So, H is 8,000. So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. 11 times 8,000 is 88,000. So, 88,000 divided by 11 is 8,000. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 88,000 divided by 11. Let me do that division step by step.

11 into 88,000.

11 into 88 is 8, because 11 times 8 is 88. So, 8 times 11 is 88. Subtract 88 from 88, you get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 0. So, 11 into 00 is 0. So, 0 times 11 is 0. Subtract 0, you get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 0. 11 into 0 is 0, but wait, 11 into 0 is 0, but 0 times 11 is 0. Subtract 0, you get 0. Bring down the last digit, which is 0. 11 into 0 is 0,
