Q: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

Okay, so Carlos is planting a lemon tree, and he wants to figure out how many years it will take before he starts earning money on it. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the tree costs $90 to plant. That's a one-time cost, so he has to pay that upfront. Then, each year, the tree grows 7 lemons. He can sell each lemon for $1.5. So, I guess the revenue from the lemons would be 7 lemons multiplied by $1.5 each year. But wait, he also has to consider the costs: it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, each year, he has to pay $3 for maintenance. 

So, the question is, how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. That probably means when his total revenue from the lemons exceeds his costs, right? So, we need to find the break-even point where his total revenue equals his total costs.

Let me write down the information:

- Initial cost: $90
- Annual growth: 7 lemons
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5
- Annual maintenance cost: $3

So, each year, he gets 7 * $1.5 in revenue, which is $10.50. But he also has to pay $3 each year for maintenance. So, the net profit per year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

Wait, so each year, he's making a profit of $7.50. But he also has to pay the initial $90 to plant the tree. So, he needs to cover that initial cost before he starts making a profit.

So, the total profit after n years would be n * $7.50. We need to find the smallest n where n * $7.50 >= $90.

Let me write that as an equation:

7.50 * n >= 90

To solve for n, divide both sides by 7.50:

n >= 90 / 7.50

Let me compute that. 90 divided by 7.50. Hmm, 7.50 goes into 90 how many times?

Well, 7.50 * 12 = 15, which is too low. 7.50 * 12 = 15, which is 75. Wait, no, 7.50 * 12 is 15, which is 15. Wait, no, 7.50 * 12 is 15. Wait, no, 7.50 * 12 is 15. Wait, no, 7.50 * 12 is 90. Because 7.50 * 10 is 75, and 7.50 * 2 is 15, so 75 + 15 is 90. So, 7.50 * 12 = 15, which is 15. Wait, no, 7.50 * 12 is 90. So, 90 / 7.50 is 12.

So, n >= 12. So, after 12 years, he will have earned enough to cover the initial planting cost.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me check the total revenue and total costs after 12 years.

Total revenue: 12 years * 7 lemons/year * $1.50/lemon. Let's compute that.

7 * 1.50 = 10.50 per year. So, 12 * 10.50 = 127.20.

Total costs: initial planting cost of $90, plus 12 years * $3/year = 36. So, total costs are 90 + 36 = 108.

So, total revenue is 127.20, total costs are 108. So, 127.20 - 108 = 9.20. So, he has a profit of $9.20 after 12 years.

But wait, is 12 the exact break-even point? Because 12 years gives him a profit of $9.20, which is still positive. So, does that mean that he starts earning money after 12 years? Or is it 11 years?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I need to model it differently.

Alternatively, maybe the profit each year is $7.50, so after n years, the total profit is 7.50 *
