Okay, so I have this problem here where two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai's school. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and the total number of students who voted was 80. I need to find out how many votes the loser got. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two candidates, and the total number of votes cast is 80. The winner received 3/4 of those votes. So, I need to find out how many votes the loser got. That means I need to figure out how many votes the loser received, which would be the remaining votes after subtracting the winner's votes from the total.

Alright, so if the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 3/4 of them, I can calculate the number of votes the winner got first. Then, subtract that from the total to get the loser's votes.

Let me write that down step by step.

First, calculate the number of votes the winner got:
Number of votes for winner = (3/4) * Total votes

Total votes = 80, so:
Number of votes for winner = (3/4) * 80

Hmm, let me compute that. 3/4 of 80. Well, 80 divided by 4 is 22, because 4 times 22 is 88, which is 8 more than 80. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it properly.

Wait, 80 divided by 4 is 20.5? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 4 times 20 is 80, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So, 3/4 of 80 is 3 times 20.5? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 80 divided by 4 is 20.5? Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80, so 80 divided by 4 is 22. Wait, no, 4 times 20 is 80, so 80 divided by 4 is 20. So, 3/4 of 80 is 3 times 20, which is 60. So, the winner got 60 votes.

Wait, let me check that again. 3/4 of 80. 80 divided by 4 is 20, so 3 times 20 is 60. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the winner got 60 votes. Then, the total number of votes is 80, so the loser must have gotten 80 minus 60, which is 20 votes.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3/4 of 80 is 60, so the loser is 80 - 60 = 20. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the loser got 1/4 of the votes because 1 - 3/4 is 1/4. So, 1/4 of 80 is 20. So, that also gives me 20 votes for the loser.

Wait, so both methods give me the same answer, which is 20. So, that seems consistent.

Let me just verify once more. If the winner got 60 votes, which is 3/4 of 80, then the loser got 20, which is 1/4 of 80. So, 60 + 20 is 80, which is the total number of votes. So, that adds up correctly.

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20.

Wait, hold on, 20? That seems low, but 1/4 of 80 is 20, so that's correct. 3/4 is 60, so 60 + 20 is 80. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 20 is a small number, but given that the total is 80, 20 is 1/4, which is 20. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of fractions, 3/4 is 0.75, so 0.75 times 80 is 60, and 1 - 0.75 is 0.25, so 0.25 times 80 is 20. So, that also gives me 20.

So, both methods of calculating 3/4 and
