Q: Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Michael has after he buys the hay for his horse. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that for every mile the horse runs, Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. So, I need to find out how much hay Michael needs for the horse. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many miles the horse runs. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again.

It says Michael notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, if the horse runs a certain number of miles, the amount of hay needed is half a bail per mile. But the problem doesn't give me the number of miles. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, it says Michael's horse runs for 300 minutes at 32MPH. So, the horse runs for 300 minutes, which is 300 minutes. But the speed is given in miles per hour, so I need to convert that to miles.

Okay, so 32 miles per hour. If the horse runs for 300 minutes, which is 5.5 hours, right? Because 300 divided by 60 is 5.5. So, 32 miles per hour times 5.5 hours is the distance the horse runs.

Let me calculate that: 32 * 5.5. Hmm, 32*5 is 160, and 32*0.5 is 16, so 160 +16 is 176 miles. So, the horse runs 176 miles.

Now, for every mile, Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 176 miles, he needs 176*(1/2) bails. Let me compute that: 176 divided by 2 is 88. So, he needs 88 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost is 88 * $3. Let me calculate that: 80*3 is 240, and 8*3 is 24, so 240 +24 is $264. So, Michael spends $264 on hay.

Now, Michael has six 5 dollar bills. Let me figure out how much money that is. 6*5 is $30. So, he has $30.

He spends $264 on hay, but wait, he only has $30. That doesn't make sense because he can't spend more than he has. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says Michael has six 5 dollar bills. So, 6*5 is $30. But the hay costs $264, which is way more than $30. That can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the hay needed.

Let me go back. The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH. So, 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. 30 minutes is half an hour, so 32 * 0.5 is 16 miles. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did before.

Wait, 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes. 30 minutes is half an hour, so 32 * 0.5 is 16 miles. So, the horse runs 16 miles.

Wait, so earlier I thought it was 32 *5.5, but that was incorrect. 32 miles per hour for 300 minutes is 32 * (330/60) = 32 *5.5. Wait, 330 minutes is 5.5 hours, so 32 *5.5 is 176. But 300 minutes is 5.5 hours? Wait, 330 minutes is 5.5 hours? Wait, 300 minutes is 5.5 hours? Wait, 300 divided by 60 is 5.5. So, 32 *5.5 is 176. But 330 minutes is 5.5 hours? Wait, 330 minutes is 5 hours and 30 minutes, which is 5.5 hours. So, 32 *5.5 is 176. So, why did I think it was 16 miles?

Wait, no, 32 *5.5 is
