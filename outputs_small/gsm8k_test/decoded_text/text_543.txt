Q: For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 while Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, how much more will Jairus get than Jenny?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Jairus and Jenny each do some tasks, and they get money for each task they complete. The question is asking how much more Jairus will get than Jenny if they each finish 20 tasks. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. Both of them finished 20 tasks each. I need to find the difference in the money they get. So, I think I need to calculate how much each of them gets and then subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total to see how much more Jairus gets.

Let me write down the information:

- Jairus's rate: $0.8 per task
- Jenny's rate: $0.5 per task
- Number of tasks each did: 20

So, for Jairus, the total amount he gets would be the number of tasks multiplied by his rate per task. Similarly, for Jenny, it's the number of tasks multiplied by her rate.

Let me calculate Jairus's total first. So, 20 tasks times $0.8 per task. Hmm, 20 times 0.8. Let me do that multiplication. 20 times 0.8. Well, 20 times 0.8 is the same as 20 multiplied by 8/10, which is 164/10, which is 16.4. Wait, no, that can't be right because 20 times 0.8 is actually 16.4? Wait, 20 times 0.8 is 16, and 2 times 0.8 is 1.6, so adding them together gives 16 + 1.6 = 7.6. Wait, no, that's not right either. Maybe I should do it another way.

Alternatively, 20 multiplied by 0.8. Let me think of 20 times 0.8 as 20 times 8 divided by 10. So, 20 times 8 is 160, divided by 10 is 16. So, 20 times 0.8 is 16. So, 20 tasks would give Jairus $16.00.

Wait, but 20 times 0.8 is 16? Let me check that again. 0.8 is the same as 80 cents. So, 20 tasks times 80 cents each. 20 times 80 is 1600 cents, which is $16.00. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, Jenny's total. She gets $0.5 per task, and she also did 20 tasks. So, 20 times 0.5. Hmm, 20 times 0.5 is 10.00. So, Jenny gets $10.00.

So, Jairus gets $16.00, and Jenny gets $10.00. The question is, how much more does Jairus get than Jenny? So, I need to subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total.

So, 16.00 minus 10.00 is 6.00. So, Jairus gets $6.00 more than Jenny.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. So, 20 tasks times 0.8 is 16, and 20 times 0.5 is 10. 16 minus 10 is 6. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way. Since both of them did the same number of tasks, 20, the difference in their earnings per task is 0.8 minus 0.5, which is 0.3. So, for each task, Jairus gets 0.3 more than Jenny. So, for 20 tasks, the total difference would be 20 times 0.3, which is 6.00. So, that also gives me 6.00. So, that's another way to think about it.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is $6.00. So, I think that's the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me do the calculations again.

Jairus: 20 tasks * $0.8 per task.

20 * 0.8: Let's break it down. 20 * 0.8 is 16.00, and 2 *
