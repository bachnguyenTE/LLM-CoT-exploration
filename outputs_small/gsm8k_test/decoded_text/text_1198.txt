Q: To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak on his first day. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day. He planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak. So, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 20 multiplied by 2, which equals 40.

Next, I'll calculate the number of trees planted on the second day. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 plus 10, totaling 30. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day. The first day he planted 40, so 1/4 of that is 10, and adding that to the original 40 gives 54.

Finally, I'll add up all the trees planted over the two days. The total number of White Oak trees is 20 plus 33, which equals 55. The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 plus 54, which equals 94. Adding these together, Mr. Julius planted a total of 55 plus 94 trees, totaling 149.

To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, let's break down the information step by step.

### **First Day:**
- **White Oak Trees:** 20
- **Lodgepole Pine Trees:** Twice as many as White Oak trees.
  
  \[
  \text{Lodgepole Pine Trees} = 2 \times 20 = 40
  \]

### **Second Day:**
- **White Oak Trees:** 10 more than the first day.
  
  \[
  \text{White Oak Trees} = 20 + 10 = 30
  \]
  
- **Lodgepole Pine Trees:** 1/4 more than the first day.
  
  \[
  \text{Additional Lodgepole Pine Trees} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Total Lodgepole Pine Trees} = 40 + 10 = 50
  \]

### **Total Trees Planted:**
- **White Oak Trees:** 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50
- **Lodgepole Pine Trees:** 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90

\[
\text{Total Trees} = 50 \text{ (White Oak)} + 90 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = \boxed{140}
\]
