Q: Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?

Okay, so I have this problem about Heather's razors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the razors come in packs of 4, and each pack is $4.00. They're on sale with a "buy one get one free" deal. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. She wants to buy 2 packs, and we need to find out how much each individual razor will cost in cents after the discount. 

Alright, let's break this down. 

First, the original price per pack is $4.00. Since she's buying 2 packs, without any discounts, that would be 2 times $4.00. Let me calculate that: 2 * $4.00 = $8.00. So, the total cost before any discounts would be $8.00.

But there's a "buy one get one free" deal. That means for every two packs, she only pays for one. So, if she buys 2 packs, she only pays for $4.00. Let me confirm that: 2 packs, buy one get one free, so 1 pack at full price, 1 pack at half price. So, 1 * $4.00 + 1 * $4.00 = $8.00. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the deal.

Wait, no, the deal is "buy one get one free," which usually means that for every two items, you pay for one. So, if she buys two packs, she pays for one pack and gets the second one free. So, the total cost would be $4.00 for two packs. So, that's $4.00. 

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing because each pack is $4.00. So, if she buys two packs, normally it's $8.00, but with the deal, it's $4.00. So, that's a significant discount. 

But then, she also has a $2.00 coupon. So, after the discount, she can use her coupon to get an additional discount. So, let's see. 

First, the total cost before the coupon is $4.000 for two packs. Then, she can use her $2.000 coupon, so subtracting that from the total. So, $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. 

So, the total cost after the discount and using the coupon is $2.000. 

But wait, the question is asking for the cost per individual razor in cents. So, each razor is part of the total cost. 

Wait, but she's buying two packs, each pack has 4 razors. So, in total, she's getting 8 razors. So, each razor would cost $2.00 divided by 8. Let me calculate that: $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor. 

But the question asks for the cost in cents. So, $0.25 is equal to 25 cents. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.

1. Each pack is $4.00.
2. She buys 2 packs, so normally it's $8.00.
3. The deal is buy one get one free, so she only pays for one pack, which is $4.00.
4. She has a $2.00 coupon, so subtract that from the $4.00, getting $2.00 total.
5. She has 2 packs, each with 4 razors, so 8 razors in total.
6. Each razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25, which is 25 cents.

Wait, but hold on. Is the coupon applied after the discount? Or is the coupon applied before the discount? The problem says "buy one get one free," which is a discount, and then she has a coupon. So, the order is: first, the discount, then the coupon. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, if the coupon was applied first, the total would be $2.00, and then the discount would be applied on that. But the problem says "buy one get one free," which is a discount, so the coupon is applied after the discount.

So, the total cost is $2.00, which is 200 cents, and she has 8 razors, so each razor is 200 / 8 = 25 cents.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the "buy one get one
