Q: A class of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a class of 50 students and their hobbies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like either video games or music. Hmm, okay. So, the rest would be 50 minus 10 minus 5. Let me write that down:

Total students = 50  
Bakers = 10  
Basketball players = 5  
So, the remaining students = 50 - 10 -5 = 35.

Wait, so 35 students like either video games or music. Got it. Now, the problem also says that the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Hmm, let me parse that.

Number who like music = 2 × number who like basketball.  
Basketball players = 5, so music players = 2 × 5 = 10.

So, 10 students like music. Now, since the remaining 35 students like either video games or music, and we know how many like music, we can find out how many like video games.

Let me denote the number of students who like video games as V and the number who like music as M. From the problem, M = 2 × B, where B is the number of basketball players. So, M = 2 × 5 = 10.

So, M = 10. Then, the total number of students who like either video games or music is V + M = 35. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the total number of students who like video games or music is 35, right? Because 50 total minus 10 bakers minus 5 basketball players is 35. Wait, hold on, that doesn't add up.

Wait, 50 total. 10 bakers, 5 basketball players, so 10 + 5 = 15. So, 50 -15 = 35. So, 35 students like either video games or music. But the problem says the rest like either video games or music. So, 35 students like video games or music.

But wait, the problem says the number that like music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. So, M = 2 × B. So, M = 10. So, if M =10, then V + M =35. So, V +10 =35. Therefore, V =35 -10 = -5. Wait, that can't be right. You can't have negative students liking video games.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Let me go back. Total students:50. Bakers:10, Basketball players:5. So, 10 +5=15. So, 50-15=35. So, 35 students like either video games or music.

Number who like music is twice the number who like basketball. So, M=2×B=2×5=10. So, M=10.

So, if M=10, then V + M =35. So, V=35 -10=25.

Wait, that makes sense. So, 25 students like video games, and 10 like music. So, 25 +10=35, which is the number of students who like either video games or music. So, that adds up.

Wait, but the problem says "the rest like to either play video games or play music." So, that's 35 students. So, 25 like video games, 10 like music. So, 25 is the answer.

But let me double-check. 10 bakers, 5 basketball players, 25 video games, 10 music. 10+5+25+10=50. Yes, that adds up. So, 25 students like video games.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought 35 students like either video games or music, but that was a mistake because 50-15=35, but 35 is the number of students who like video games or music, not the number of students who like either. So, that was my confusion.

So, to clarify, 10 like basketball, 25 like video games, 10 like music, and 5 like baking. So, 10+25+10+5=35? Wait, no, 10+5+25+1
