Q: The eighth-grade class held a bake-off. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. If Suzanne made 36 cookies, how many did Kelsie make?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Kelsie, Josh, and Suzanne making cookies for their bake-off. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what "two times more" means. Is it like double the number, or is it something else? I think when someone says "two times more," it usually means twice as much. So if Josh made, say, 10 cookies, Kelsie would make 10 + 2*10 = 20 cookies. So yeah, that makes sense. So Kelsie's cookies are double Josh's.

Next, the problem states that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Okay, so if Suzanne made, let's say, 20 cookies, Josh would make 20 divided by 4, which is 5. So Josh made 5, Suzanne made 20, and Kelsie made 10. That seems to fit.

But wait, the problem gives me Suzanne's number of cookies, which is 36. So I need to find out how many Kelsie made. Let me write down what I know:

- Suzanne made 36 cookies.
- Josh made one-fourth of that, so that's 36 divided by 4.
- Kelsie made two times more than Josh, so that's twice Josh's number.

Let me calculate Josh's cookies first. If Suzanne made 36, then one-fourth of that is 36 / 4. Let me do that division. 36 divided by 4 is... 4 goes into 36 how many times? 4*9 is 36, so that's 9. So Josh made 9 cookies.

Now, Kelsie made two times more than Josh. So that's 2 times 9. 2*9 is 18. So Kelsie made 18 cookies.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Suzanne made 36, Josh made 1/4 of that, which is 9. Then Kelsie made two times more than Josh, so 9*2 is 18. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as Kelsie's cookies are 2*(Josh's cookies). Since Josh's cookies are 1/4 of Suzanne's, which is 36, so Josh's cookies are 36*(1/4) = 9. Then Kelsie's cookies are 2*9 = 18. So that's another way to get the same answer.

I think that's correct. So Kelsie made 18 cookies.

**Final Answer**
Kelsie made \boxed{18} cookies.
</think>

Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, Josh made:

\[
\frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ cookies}
\]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Therefore, Kelsie made:

\[
2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ cookies}
\]

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
