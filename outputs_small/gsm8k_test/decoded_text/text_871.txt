Q: Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many pizza pieces has he eaten so far?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Tobias and his pizza. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. Wait, hold on, 66? That seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 60 pieces? Yeah, that makes more sense because 66 would be a bit too many for a pizza, especially if it's divided into fractions. So, I'll go with 60 pieces.

He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day. Hmm, okay. So, let me calculate how many pieces that is. If there are 60 pieces, then 2/5 of 60 is... let me do the math. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 60. Let me compute that. 0.4 times 60. Well, 0.4 times 60 is the same as 0.4 times 60. Let me break it down: 0.4 times 60. 0.4 times 60 is 24. So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day. Okay, that seems manageable.

Then, on the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, that's straightforward. He ate 10 more pieces. So, after the first two days, he's eaten 24 plus 10, which is 34 pieces. So, 34 pieces eaten so far.

Now, on the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. Hmm, okay. So, after the first two days, he had some pieces left. Let me figure out how many pieces were left after day one and day two.

He started with 60 pieces. On day one, he ate 24, so 60 minus 24 is 36. So, 36 pieces left after day one. Then, on day two, he ate 10 pieces. So, 36 minus 10 is 26. So, 26 pieces left after day two.

So, on day three, he ate 7/13 of those remaining 26 pieces. Let me compute that. 7/13 of 26. So, 7 divided by 13 is approximately 2.3333, but let me do it properly. 26 times 7 is 182, and then divided by 13. So, 182 divided by 13. Let me compute that. 13 times 13 is 169, so 182 minus 169 is 13. So, 13/13 is 1. So, 13 times 13 is 169, plus 13 is 172. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 13 times 14 is 182. So, 13 times 14 is 182. So, 182 divided by 13 is 14. So, 7/13 of 26 is 14. So, he ate 14 pieces on day three.

So, let me recap. He ate 24 on day one, 10 on day two, and 14 on day three. So, total eaten is 24 plus 10 plus 14. Let me add that up. 24 plus 10 is 34, plus 14 is 48. So, he's eaten 48 pieces in total.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes when you have fractions, it's easy to make a mistake. So, let me go through each step again.

Starting with 60 pieces. Day one: 2/5 of 60 is 24. 60 minus 24 is 36. Day two: 10 pieces eaten, so 36 minus 10 is 26. Day three: 7/13 of 26. So, 7/13 of 26. Let me compute 26 divided by 13 is 2, so 7 times 2 is 14. So, 14 pieces eaten on day three. So, 24 plus 10 plus 14 is 48. So, 48 pieces eaten in total.

Wait, but let me make sure that 7/13 of 26 is indeed 14. So, 26 divided by 13 is 2, so 2 times
