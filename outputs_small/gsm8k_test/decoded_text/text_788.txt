Q: John is raising money for a school trip. He has applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. How much money is John missing if he has $50 and the trip costs $300?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total cost of the trip, which is $300.

Next, calculate the amount the school will cover, which is half of $300, so $150.

Then, find out how much more money John needs by subtracting the amount he has ($50) from the school's contribution ($150). This results in $100 missing.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   
   The total cost of the school trip is given as:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$300
   \]

2. **Amount Covered by the School:**
   
   The school has decided to cover half of the cost. Therefore, the amount covered by the school is:
   
   \[
   \text{School Contribution} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$300 = \$150
   \]

3. **Amount John Still Needs:**
   
   John has already raised \$50. To find out how much more he needs, subtract the amount he has from the school's contribution:
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Missing} = \$150 - \$50 = \$100
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$100}
\]
