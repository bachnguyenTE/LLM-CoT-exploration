Q: Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. How many stripes do the zebras have on average?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here about zebras and their stripes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, Jane counts two zebras, each with 17 stripes. Then there's another zebra with 36 stripes, and another one with half that many stripes. I need to find the average number of stripes on all these zebras. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me list out all the zebras and their stripe counts. The problem says Jane counts two zebras, each with 17 stripes. So that's 17 stripes each. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. Half of 36 is... let me calculate that. Half of 36 is 18, right? So that's 18 stripes.

So, summarizing the counts: two zebras with 17 each, one with 36, and one with 18. So, how many zebras is that in total? Let me count: two plus one plus one is four zebras. So, four zebras in total.

Now, to find the average number of stripes, I need to add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras. So, let's add up the stripes. Two zebras with 17 each: 17 plus 17 is 34. Then, the third zebra has 36 stripes, so 34 plus 36 is 40. Wait, 34 plus 36 is 40? Wait, no, 34 plus 36 is 40? Wait, 34 plus 30 is 64, plus 6 is 70? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 17 plus 17 is 34, plus 36 is 34 plus 36. Let me do that again. 34 plus 30 is 64, plus 6 is 70. So, 70 stripes so far. Then, the last zebra has 18 stripes. So, 70 plus 18 is... 70 plus 10 is 80, plus 8 is 88. So, total stripes are 88.

Wait, let me double-check that. 17 + 17 is 34, plus 36 is 70, plus 18 is 88. Yeah, that's correct. So, total stripes are 88.

Now, since there are four zebras, the average number of stripes per zebra is total stripes divided by number of zebras. So, 88 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So, the average is 22 stripes per zebra.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding. So, 17 + 17 is 34, plus 36 is 70, plus 18 is 88. Yeah, that's correct. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So, the average is 22.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can calculate the total stripes another way. So, two zebras with 17 each: 17*2 is 34. Then, 36 plus 18 is 54. So, 34 plus 54 is 88. Yep, same result. So, 88 divided by 4 is 22. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as adding all the numbers together. So, 17, 17, 36, 18. Let me add them in a different order to see if I get the same total. Let's add 17 and 18 first. 17 plus 18 is 35. Then, 17 plus 36 is 53. Then, 35 plus 53 is 88. So, same total. So, 88 divided by 4 is 22. So, that's correct.

Wait, another way: 17 is 10 plus 7, 17 is 10 plus 7, 36 is 30 plus 6, 18 is 10 plus 8. Maybe adding the tens and the ones separately. So, tens: 10 +10 +30 +10. Let's see: 10 +10 is 20, plus 30 is 50,
