Q: Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Brinley has taken five tests so far, and she needs to take a sixth one to get an average of 93 across all six tests. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I know that the average is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of tests. So, if she wants an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of all her scores needs to be 93 multiplied by 6. Let me write that down:

Total required sum = 93 * 6

Let me calculate that. 93 times 6... 90 times 6 is 540, and 3 times 6 is 18, so adding those together, 540 + 18 = 558. So, the total sum of all six tests needs to be 558.

Now, Brinley has already taken five tests with scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Let me add those up to see how much she has so far.

Adding 89 and 71 first: 89 + 71 = 160.

Then, adding 92 to that: 160 + 92 = 252.

Next, adding 100: 252 + 100 = 362.

Then, adding 86: 362 + 86 = 448.

So, the sum of her first five tests is 448.

She needs the total sum to be 558, so the sixth test score must be 558 minus 448. Let me compute that.

558 - 448 = 110.

Wait, that seems low. Is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

First, the total required sum is 93 * 6 = 558. Correct.

Sum of first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86.

Let me add them again step by step:

89 + 71: 89 + 70 is 159, plus 1 is 160.

160 + 92: 160 + 90 is 250, plus 2 is 252.

252 + 100: 252 + 100 is 352.

352 + 86: 352 + 80 is 432, plus 6 is 438.

Wait, hold on, earlier I got 448, but now I'm getting 438. That's a discrepancy. Did I add wrong the first time?

Let me add them again:

89 + 71: 89 + 71. 80 + 70 is 150, 9 +1 is 10, so 150 +10 is 160. That's correct.

160 + 92: 160 + 90 is 250, plus 2 is 252. Correct.

252 + 100: 252 + 100 is 352. Correct.

352 + 86: 352 + 80 is 432, plus 6 is 438. So, the sum of the first five tests is 438, not 448 as I thought earlier. That was my mistake.

So, the sixth test score needs to be 558 - 438. Let me compute that.

558 - 438: 558 - 400 is 118, minus 38 is 110. So, 110.

Wait, so she needs a 110 on the sixth test? That seems really high. Is that correct?

Let me verify again. If she scores 110 on the sixth test, the total sum would be 438 + 111 = 549. Wait, but 549 is less than 558. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, no, 438 + 111 is 549, which is still less than 558. So, that would mean her average would be 549 /6 = 91.5, which is below 93. So, that can't be.

Wait, so I must have messed up the total required
