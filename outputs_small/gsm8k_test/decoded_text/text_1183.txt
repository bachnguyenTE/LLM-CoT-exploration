Q: Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?

Okay, so I have this problem here about apples falling out of a tree and Newton doing some actions with them. I need to figure out how many apples Newton brings home. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says: Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Then, Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. So, I need to find out how many apples he brings home.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. It seems like there are multiple stages here, each time apples falling out of the tree, and Newton doing some actions that affect the number of apples.

Let me try to outline each step:

1. First, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One landed on Newton's head.
3. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. So, after this action, how many apples are left on the ground?

Wait, so initially, two apples fell out. One landed on Newton's head, so that's one apple on the ground. Then, Newton picked up two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. So, he threw one apple into the tree, which means that apple is no longer on the ground. So, the number of apples on the ground after this action would be the one that landed on his head minus the one he threw into the tree. So, 1 - 1 = 0 apples on the ground.

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So, two apples fell out. One landed on his head, so that's one apple on the ground. Then, he picks up two apples, puts one in his pocket, and throws the other into the tree. So, he threw one apple into the tree, so that apple is no longer on the ground. So, the apples on the ground are the one that landed on his head minus the one he threw into the tree. So, 1 -1 = 0. So, after this, there are no apples on the ground.

But then, the problem says that this caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, after this action, 5 more apples fell out. So, if there were 0 apples on the ground before, and then 5 more fell out, that would make 5 apples on the ground.

Wait, but hold on. Is the 5 apples the result of the action, or is it the number of apples that fell out after the action? Let me read the problem again.

"Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree."

So, the action of Newton caused 5 more apples to fall out. So, the 5 apples are the result of the action, not the number of apples that fell out after the action.

So, let me try to model this step by step.

First, initial state: 0 apples on the ground.

1. Two apples fell out. So, apples on the ground: 2.

2. One landed on Newton's head. So, apples on the ground: 1.

3. Newton picked up two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one into the tree. So, apples on the ground: 1 -1 = 0.

4. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, apples on the ground: 0 +5 =5.

5. Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. So, apples on the ground: 5 -5 =0.

Wait, but hold on. So, after step 4, apples on the ground are 5. Then, Newton picks up all the remaining apples, which are 5, and goes home. So, he doesn't leave any behind. So, he brings home 0 apples.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to model each step with variables.

Let me denote the number of apples on the ground at each step.

Let’s denote:

- Start: 0 apples on the ground.

1. Two apples fell out. So, apples on the ground: 2.

2. One landed on Newton's head. So, apples on the ground: 2 -1 =1.

3. Newton picked up two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one into the tree. So, apples on the ground: 1 -1 =0.

4. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. So, apples
