Q: A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?

Okay, so I have this problem about a train traveling between three cities. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the train goes from the first city to the second, which is 75 miles. Then from the second to the third, that's 100 miles. Hmm, okay, so far so good. Now, it says it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance to go from the third city back to the first. Wait, so the distance from the third city to the first is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two legs? Let me write that down.

So, the distance from the first to the second is 75 miles, and from the second to the third is 100 miles. So, the combined distance from the second to the third is 75 + 100, which is 175 miles. Then, the distance from the third to the first is 50 miles less than that. So, 175 - 50 is 125 miles. So, the third leg is 125 miles.

Let me just recap: first leg is 75, second is 100, third is 125. So, the total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 +125. Let me add those up. 75 + 100 is 175, plus 125 is 300. So, each trip is 300 miles.

Wait, hold on, the problem says it does this trip 3 times a day. So, each day, the train travels 3 times 300 miles. Let me calculate that. 3 times 300 is 900 miles per day.

Now, the train needs service every 18,000 miles. So, how many days does it go between services? That means we need to find out how many times 900 miles goes into 18,000 miles.

So, I need to divide 18,000 by 900. Let me do that. 18,000 divided by 900. Well, 900 goes into 18,000 how many times? Let me think. 900 times 2 is 1,800, which is 18,000 divided by 10. So, 900 times 20 is 18,000. So, 18,000 divided by 900 is 20.

Wait, let me verify that. 900 times 20 is indeed 18,000 because 900 times 10 is 9,000, so times 20 is 18,000. So, yes, 20 days.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial calculations. So, the first leg is 75, second is 100, third is 125. Adding those up: 75 + 100 is 175, plus 125 is 300. So, each trip is 300 miles. Then, 3 trips a day is 900 miles. 18,000 divided by 900 is 20. So, 20 days.

Wait, but 900 times 20 is 18,000, which is exactly the number given for service. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me think again. The train goes 75, 100, 125, which is 300. 3 times that is 900. 18,000 divided by 900 is 20. So, 20 days. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 20 days.

**Final Answer**
The train goes between services for \boxed{20} days.

The train travels between three cities with the following distances:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text
