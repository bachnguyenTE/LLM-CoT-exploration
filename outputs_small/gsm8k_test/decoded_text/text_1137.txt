Q: Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Donny and his water bottles. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Wait, no, the problem says "at least 40 degrees" or is it "at least 40 degrees"? Wait, no, the original problem says "at least 40 degrees." Wait, no, let me check. The user wrote: "Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water.

Wait, hold on, the user wrote "at least 40 degrees" but in the problem statement, it's "at least 40 degrees." Maybe a typo? Because 40 is 40, but in the problem, it's 40?
