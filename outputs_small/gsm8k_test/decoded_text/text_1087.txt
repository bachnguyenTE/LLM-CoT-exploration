Q: A farmer is baling hay in their field. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a farmer baling hay and a truck picking them up. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay. So, that's straightforward. Every hour, the farmer is adding 5 bales to the field. On the other hand, the truck is picking up hay as well. Each hour, the truck picks up 3 bales. So, the truck is bringing in 3 bales every hour. 

Now, both the farmer and the truck are working for a 6-hour day. I need to find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after this 6-hour day. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate how many bales each of them collects in 6 hours and then subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales the farmer has baled.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. 

First, the farmer's baling rate is 5 bales per hour. So, over 6 hours, the farmer would have baled:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Okay, so the farmer bales 30 bales in 6 hours.

Now, the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. So, over 6 hours, the truck would have picked up:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Got it. So, the truck brings in 18 bales in 6 hours.

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, I need to subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales baled by the farmer. That makes sense because the truck is taking away hay from the field.

So, the calculation would be:

30 bales (baled by farmer) - 18 bales (picked up by truck) = 12 bales.

Wait, hold on. The truck picks up 18 bales? Let me double-check that. 3 bales per hour times 6 hours is indeed 18 bales. And the farmer bales 5 bales per hour times 6 hours is 30 bales. So, 30 minus 18 is 12. Hmm, that seems right.

But wait, let me think again. Is the truck bringing in hay from the field or is it taking hay from the field? The problem says the truck is picking up hay. So, it's bringing in hay, which would mean the field is losing hay. So, yes, the number of bales left would be the farmer's bales minus the truck's bales.

So, 30 minus 18 is 12. Wait, hold on, 30 minus 18 is 12? Wait, 30 minus 10 is 20, minus 8 more is 12. Yeah, that's correct. So, 12 bales left in the field.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 5 times 6 is 30, that's correct. 3 times 6 is 18, that's correct. So, 30 minus 18 is 12. So, 12 bales left.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe per hour? Let's see. Each hour, the farmer adds 5 bales, and the truck removes 3 bales. So, the net gain per hour is 5 minus 3, which is 2 bales per hour. So, over 6 hours, the net gain would be 2 times 6, which is 12 bales. So, that also gives 12 bales left.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 12 bales. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the truck bringing in hay or is it taking hay? The problem says the truck is picking up hay. So, it's bringing in hay, which would mean the field is losing hay. So, the number of bales left is the farmer's bales minus the truck's bales.

Alternatively, if the truck was removing hay, it would be adding hay, but the problem says it's picking up, so it's bringing in hay. So, the field is losing hay. So, 30 minus 18 is 12.

Alternatively, if I think about it as the farmer is adding 5 bales, and the truck is taking 3 bales, so the net change per hour is 2 bales. So, over 6 hours, 2 times 6
