Okay, so Tim is planning to light off fireworks for the Fourth of July. Let me try to figure out how much he spent in total. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, he buys a package of fireworks worth $400. Then, he buys another pack that's twice as much. So, the second package must be 2 times $400. Let me calculate that. 2 multiplied by 400 is... 800. So, the second package is $800. 

Now, he also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Wait, hold on, the question says $150? Let me check. It says $150, so that's $150. Okay, so that's another $150.

So, let me add up all the costs. The first package is $400, the second is $800, and the finale is $150. So, adding them together: 400 + 800 + 150.

Let me do the addition step by step. 400 plus 800 is... 1280. Then, adding 150 to that. 1280 plus 150. Hmm, 1280 plus 100 is 1390, and then plus 40 is 1434. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.

Wait, 400 + 800 is 1200, right? Because 400 + 800 is 1200. Then, adding 150 to 1200. 1200 + 100 is 1300, and then +50 is 1350. So, total is $1350.

But hold on, he also gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. So, I need to calculate the total before discount and then apply the 20% off.

So, the total before discount is $1350. A 20% discount on that. Let me compute 20% of 1350. 20% is the same as 0.20, so 0.20 multiplied by 1350. Let me do that: 0.20 * 1350. 0.2 times 1000 is 200, 0.2 times 300 is 60, and 0.2 times 50 is 10. So, 200 + 60 + 10 is 270. So, the discount is $270.

Wait, no, that can't be right. 20% of 1350 is actually 270. So, the discount is $270. So, the total after discount is 1350 minus 270, which is 1080. So, $1080.

Wait, but let me double-check. 20% of 1350: 10% is 135, so 20% is 270. So, yes, 1350 minus 270 is 1080. So, the total amount he spent is $1080.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the fireworks. So, first package is 400, second is 800, and the finale is 150. So, 400 + 800 is 1200, plus 150 is 1350. Then, 20% discount on 1350 is 270, so 1350 - 270 is 1080. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says he buys a package worth $400 and another worth twice that much. So, 400 and 800. Then, a finale firework that costs $150. So, 400 + 800 is 1280, plus 150 is 1335? Wait, wait, hold on, 400 + 800 is 1280? Wait, 400 + 800 is 1200, right? Because 400 + 800 is 1200. Then, plus 150 is 1350. So,
