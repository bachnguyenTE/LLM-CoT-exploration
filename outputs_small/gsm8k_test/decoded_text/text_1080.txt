Q: If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?

Okay, so I have this problem here: "If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says that every second, one bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish. So, if I have one spring, it makes one jellyfish per second. Now, the question is, if I have five of these springs working at the same rate, how many jellyfish would they create in four hours?

Alright, so I need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by five springs over four hours. Let me break this down.

First, let's figure out how many seconds are in four hours because the rate is given per second. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, 60 minutes times 60 seconds per minute. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Actually, 1 hour = 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, 1 hour = 60 minutes * 60 seconds per minute. Let me compute that.

60 minutes * 60 seconds = 60*60. Hmm, 60 times 60. Let me compute that. 60*60 is 3960 seconds in an hour. Wait, is that right? Wait, 60*60: 60*60 is 3960? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 60*60 is 3960? Wait, no, 60*60 is 3600, but 60*60 is 3960? Wait, no, 60*60 is 3960? Wait, 60*60: 60*60 is 3600, and 60*6 is 360, so 3600+360=3960. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 hour is 3600 seconds, and 4 hours would be 4*3600.

So, 4*3600. Let me compute that. 4*3000 is 12000, and 4*600 is 2400, so 12000+2400=14400 seconds. So, 4 hours is 14400 seconds.

So, each spring creates one jellyfish every second. So, if I have five springs, each creating one jellyfish per second, then in one second, how many jellyfish are created? It should be 5, right? Because each spring is creating one, and there are five.

Therefore, in one second, 5 jellyfish are created. So, over 14400 seconds, how many jellyfish are created? That would be 5 multiplied by 14400.

So, 5*14400. Let me compute that. 5*10000 is 50000, 5*4000 is 20000, so 50000+20000=70000. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 14400 is 10000+4000+400. So, 5*10000=50000, 5*4000=20000, 5*400=2000. So, adding those together: 50000+20000=70000, plus 2000 is 76000. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 5*14400 is 72000. Wait, maybe I'm messing up the multiplication.

Wait, 14400 is 14 thousands and 400. So, 5*14 thousands is 70 thousands, and 5*400 is 2000. So, 70 thousands plus 2000 is 72 thousands and 200, which is 72200. Wait, that's 72,200. Wait, but 5*14400 is 72,000. Wait, no, 14400*5 is
