Q: A DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. There are two DVDs in the public library, one has been played 356 times and the other has been played 135 times. How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?

Okay, so I have this problem here about DVDs and how many times they can be played before they break. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. That seems like a pretty long time, but okay, I guess it's a library DVD. There are two DVDs in the library, and one has been played 356 times, and the other has been played 135 times. The question is asking how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break.

Hmm, so each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. That means each one has a limit of 1000 plays. Now, one DVD has already been played 356 times, and the other has been played 135 times. So, I guess I need to figure out how many more times each can be played before they reach 1000, and then add those together to get the total number of plays before both break.

Let me write that down. For the first DVD, it's been played 356 times. So, the remaining plays would be 1000 minus 356. Let me calculate that: 1000 minus 356. Hmm, 1000 minus 300 is 1000, and then minus 56 more is 944. So, the first DVD can be played 944 more times before it breaks.

Now, for the second DVD, it's been played 135 times. So, the remaining plays would be 1000 minus 135. Let me do that subtraction: 1000 minus 100 is 890, and then minus 5 more is 885. So, the second DVD can be played 885 more times before it breaks.

Now, to find the total number of times both can be played before they break, I need to add those two numbers together. So, 944 plus 885. Let me add those. 900 plus 800 is 1700, and then 44 plus 85 is 129. So, 1700 plus 129 is 1829. So, the total number of plays before both break is 1829.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 1000 minus 356 is 644? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1000 minus 356. Let me do it step by step. 1000 minus 300 is 700, and then minus 56 is 644. So, that's correct, 644. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 944. Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the numbers.

Wait, no, the first DVD has been played 356 times, so 1000 minus 356 is 644. So, that's correct. Then the second one is 1000 minus 135, which is 865. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 885. Wait, 1000 minus 135 is 965, but since it's 135, it's 1000 minus 100 is 899, minus 35 is 864. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully. Let's do 1000 minus 135. So, 1000 minus 100 is 890, and then minus 35 is 855. Wait, no, 1000 minus 100 is 899, then minus 35 is 864. Wait, so 1000 minus 135 is 865? Wait, no, 1000 minus 100 is 900, minus 35 is 895. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should write it out:

1000
- 135

Starting from the rightmost digit: 0 minus 5. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 0, so I have to go to the hundreds place. The hundreds place is also 0, so I have to go to the thousands place. So, borrow 1 from the
