Q: Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ford and his roses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Ford grows 40 roses every week. Hmm, wait, 40? That seems a bit odd because usually, we deal with whole numbers, but maybe it's a typo. I'll go with 40 roses per week. 

Then, there are three flower shops. The first one orders 20 roses, the second orders 15, and the third orders 30. So, let me write that down:

- First shop: 20 roses
- Second shop: 15 roses
- Third shop: 30 roses

The question is asking how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. So, I need to find out the total number of roses all the shops need in a month and then subtract what Ford is growing in a month. The difference will be how many roses he's lacking.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I need to find out how many weeks are in a month. Hmm, usually, a month can be 4 weeks, but sometimes it's 4.33 weeks if we consider the number of days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's safe to assume 4 weeks. Alternatively, maybe it's 4 weeks and some extra days, but since the problem doesn't give specific days, I think 4 weeks is a safe assumption.

So, if Ford grows 40 roses every week, then in a month (4 weeks), he grows 40 * 4 roses. Let me calculate that:

40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses per month.

Okay, so Ford grows 160 roses in a month.

Now, let's find out how many roses all the flower shops need in a month. There are three shops:

1. First shop: 20 roses
2. Second shop: 15 roses
3. Third shop: 30 roses

So, adding those up: 20 + 15 +30.

Let me compute that:

20 +15 is 35, and 35 +30 is 65. So, total roses needed by all shops in a month is 65 roses.

Wait, hold on, 20 +15 is 35, and 35 +30 is 65. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Ford needs 65 roses in total to supply all the shops in a month.

But Ford is growing 160 roses in a month. So, to find out how many he lacks, I subtract the total needed from the total he grows.

So, 160 - 65 = 95.

Wait, 160 - 65 is 95? Let me check that subtraction:

160 - 65:

60 - 60 is 0, and 10 -5 is 5, so 0 +5=5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 160 -65 is 95? Hmm, 65 +95 is 160, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but 160 -65 is 95? Let me do it another way:

160 -60 is 10, and then subtract 5 more, so 10 -5=5. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 160 -65 is 95? Let me count:

65 +95: 60 +90=150, 5 +5=10, so 150 +10=161? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 65 +95 is 160? Wait, 65 +95: 60 +90=150, 5 +5=10, so 150 +10=160. Yes, that's correct. So, 65 +95=160. So, 160 -65=95. So, Ford needs 95 roses in total.

Wait, but hold on, the total needed is 65, and he grows 160, so he has 160 -65=95 roses left. So, he doesn't need to supply all the shops, he just needs 65, so he has 95 roses left.

But the question is asking how many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month. So, he needs 65, he has 160, so
