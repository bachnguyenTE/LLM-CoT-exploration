Q: Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, how many times does Sandra have to babysit?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many eggs Sandra requires to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan needs 3 eggs, I'll multiply 15 by 3 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Next, I'll figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect all those eggs. She receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, so I'll divide the total number of eggs by 9 to find the number of babysitting sessions required.

Finally, I'll present the answer clearly, stating how many times Sandra must babysit to gather enough eggs for the flans.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans:**
   
   Each Spanish flan requires **3 eggs**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total eggs needed} = 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs:**
   
   Sandra receives **9 eggs** each time she babysits.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of babysitting sessions} = \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 5 \text{ sessions}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   Sandra needs to babysit **5 times** to gather enough eggs for the 15 Spanish flans.

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
