Okay, so Tom is planning an anniversary trip for his wife, and he needs to figure out how much the trip will cost. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.

First, the plane tickets. Each ticket is $5000. Hmm, that seems really expensive, but maybe it's a special anniversary. So, Tom and his wife are each buying a ticket, so that's 2 tickets. Let me calculate the total cost for the plane tickets first.

Each ticket is $5000, so two tickets would be 2 multiplied by 5000. Let me write that out: 2 * 5000. Hmm, 2 times 5000. Well, 5000 times 2 is 10000. So, the plane tickets cost $10000 in total.

Next, the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it's a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. Wait, hold on, the normal price is $1500 per day? Or is it $1500? Let me check the question again. It says, "The normal price is $1500 per day." So, that's $1550 per day. Okay, so the hotel is 20% more expensive than that.

Wait, 20% is a typo, right? It should be 20%. So, 20% more expensive. So, I need to calculate 20% of $1550 and add that to the normal price to get the hotel price per day.

Let me compute 20% of $1550. First, 10% of 1550 is 1550 * 0.10, which is 155. So, 20% would be double that, which is 155 * 2 = 310. So, 20% of 1550 is $310.

Therefore, the hotel price per day is the normal price plus 20% of that, which is 1550 + 310. Let me add those together: 1550 + 310. 1550 + 300 is 1850, and then +10 is 1860. So, the hotel is $1860 per day.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. If the normal price is $1550, and the hotel is 20% more, so 1550 * 1.20. Let me compute that: 1550 * 1.20. 1550 * 1 is 1550, and 1550 * 0.20 is 310. So, 1550 + 310 is indeed 1860. Okay, so that's correct.

So, the hotel is $1860 per day. Now, they are staying for 3 days. So, the total cost for the hotel would be 3 multiplied by 1860.

Let me calculate that: 3 * 1860. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 800 is 2400, and 3 times 60 is 180. So, adding those together: 3000 + 2400 is 5400, plus 180 is 5580. So, the hotel costs $5580 for 3 days.

Now, adding the plane tickets and the hotel together. The plane tickets were $10000, and the hotel is $5580. So, total trip cost is 10000 + 5580.

Let me add those: 10000 + 5000 is 15000, and then 580 + 0 is 580. So, 15000 + 580 is 15580. Wait, that can't be right. 10000 + 5580 is 15580? Wait, 10000 + 5000 is 15000, and 580 is 580, so 15000 + 580 is 15580. Wait, no, 10000 + 55
