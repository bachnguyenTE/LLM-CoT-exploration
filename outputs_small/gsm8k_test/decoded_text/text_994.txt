Q: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Okay, so I have this problem about three little wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. They all live in a forest and howl at the moon every night. The question is asking for the combined length of time their howls last, in minutes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. It says that Tobias howls, and each howl lasts 20 seconds. So, that's straightforward. Then, Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, if I can figure out how long Chikote's howl is, I can add that to the total. And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, Igneous's howl duration is equal to the sum of Tobias and Chikote's howl durations.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. Let me assign variables to each of their howl durations. Let me denote:

- Let T be the duration of Tobias's howl in seconds.
- Let C be the duration of Chikote's howl in seconds.
- Let I be the duration of Igneous's howl in seconds.

From the problem, I know that:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Wait, 20 seconds? That seems a bit odd. Is that 20 seconds or 20 seconds? Wait, 20 is 20, so maybe it's 20 seconds? Hmm, 20 seconds is 20 seconds? Wait, no, 20 is 20? Wait, no, 20 is 20, 20 is 20 as well. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Because 20 seconds is a standard duration, and 20 seconds is also 20 seconds. Wait, no, 20 is 20, 20 is 20. Wait, no, 20 is 20, 20 is 20. Wait, maybe it's 20 seconds? Wait, the problem says "each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds." So, that's fixed. So, maybe it's 20 seconds for Tobias, and then Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that would be 20 times 2, which is 40 seconds. And Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, so that would be 20 + 40, which is 60 seconds. So, let me check that.

Wait, but 20 seconds is the duration of each howl for Tobias. So, if each howl is 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for twice as long as that. So, 20 seconds multiplied by 2 is 40 seconds. So, Chikote's howl is 40 seconds. Then, Igneous howls for as long as the other two combined, so that would be 20 + 40, which is 60 seconds. Wait, but 20 is the duration of each howl for Tobias, so is that 20 seconds or 20 minutes? Wait, the problem says "each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds." So, that's 20 seconds. So, that's fixed. So, I think I was right the first time.

So, let me write that down:

- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds
- Igneous: 20 + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Because if each howl is 20 seconds, then Chikote is twice as long, so 40 seconds, and Igneous is the sum of the other two, so 20 + 40 = 60 seconds. So, that seems correct.

So, now, to find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, I need to add up all three durations.

So, let's compute that:

Total time = Tobias + Chikote + Igneous
Total time = 20 + 40 + 60 seconds

Wait, hold on, 20 + 40 is 60, and then 60 + 60 is 126 seconds. So, 126 seconds in total.

But the question asks for the combined length in minutes. So, I need to convert 126 seconds into minutes.

Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, so 126 seconds divided by 60 seconds per minute.

Let me compute that:

126 ÷ 6
