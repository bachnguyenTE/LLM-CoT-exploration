Q: Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Okay, so I have this problem about Julia's boat and a leak. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the boat is taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rows back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, and the shore was 64 seconds away. I need to find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time she reached shore.

First, let me break down the information given. The boat is leaking water, and for every ten feet she rows, it takes two liters. So, the rate at which water is leaking is two liters per ten feet. That means, per foot, it's 2/10 liters, which simplifies to 0.2 liters per foot. But maybe I don't need to go that far.

Next, it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. So, the time per foot is sixteen seconds divided by twenty feet, which is 0.8 seconds per foot. Wait, that seems a bit fast, but okay, maybe it's correct. Let me check: 16 seconds for 20 feet, so 16/20 is 0.8 seconds per foot. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the shore was 64 seconds away. So, how many feet does she need to row to get to shore? Since she's rowing back towards shore, the distance is 64 feet. Wait, is that right? Wait, hold on. The problem says the shore was 64 seconds away. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Is that 64 feet or 64 seconds? Wait, let me read it again.

"The shore was 64 seconds away." Hmm, that wording is a bit unclear. Is it 64 feet away, or 64 seconds? Because if it's 64 seconds, and she's rowing at 16 seconds per 20 feet, then the distance would be 64 * (20/16) feet. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away." Hmm, so maybe the shore is 64 feet away? Or is it 64 seconds? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But in the context, it's about how much time she spent rowing, so maybe the distance is 64 feet? Or is it 64 seconds? Hmm.

Wait, let's see. If it's 64 seconds, and she rows at 16 seconds per 20 feet, then the distance is 64 * (20/16) = 64 * 1.25 = 80 feet. But the problem says the shore was 64 seconds away. Hmm, maybe it's 64 feet? Let me check.

Wait, actually, the problem says: "The shore was 64 seconds away." So, maybe it's 64 seconds to row to shore. So, if she takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, then the total time is 64 seconds. So, how many feet does she row in 64 seconds?

So, first, let's find her rowing speed. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is 20 feet per 16 seconds, which is 20/16 feet per second, which is approximately 3.333 feet per second. Alternatively, in terms of time per foot, it's 16/20 seconds per foot, which is 0.8 seconds per foot, as I calculated earlier.

So, if she takes 64 seconds to reach shore, how many feet does she row? Since her speed is 20 feet per 16 seconds, the number of feet she rows in 64 seconds is (20 feet / 16 seconds) * 64 seconds. Let me compute that.

20/6 is approximately 3.333 feet per second. So, 3.333 feet per second times 64 seconds is 213.333 feet. So, she rows approximately 213.13 feet to reach shore.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the shore was 64 seconds away, but that might be the time, not the distance. So, if the shore is 64 seconds away, and she takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, then the distance is 64 * (20/16) feet, which is 64 * (10/3) feet, which is approximately 213.333 feet. So
