Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Janet and her ducks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Hmm, wait, no, actually, it says 16 eggs per day. Let me check: "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day." Oh, wait, that's 16 eggs per day. So, 16 eggs in total each day. Got it.

Then, she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. So, breakfast is three eggs. And she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. So, she uses four eggs for muffins. 

So, let me break this down. She has 16 eggs in total each day. She uses some for breakfast and some for muffins. The rest she sells at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. So, I need to find out how many eggs she sells at the market each day and then multiply that by $2 to get the total earnings.

Let me write this out:

Total eggs per day: 16

Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3

Eggs used for muffins: 4

So, the eggs sold at the market would be the total minus the ones eaten for breakfast and used for muffins.

So, eggs sold = 16 - 3 - 4

Let me calculate that: 16 minus 3 is 13, and 13 minus 4 is 9. So, she sells 9 eggs at the market each day.

Then, she sells each egg for $2. So, total earnings would be 9 eggs multiplied by $2 per egg.

So, 9 * 2 = 18.

Therefore, she makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total eggs: 16

Breakfast: 3

Muffins: 4

So, 3 + 4 = 7 eggs are used for breakfast and muffins.

16 - 7 = 9 eggs left for the market.

9 eggs * $2 = $18.

Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be $18.

But hold on, let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. It says she lays 16 eggs per day. So, 16 total. Then, she eats three for breakfast and bakes four for muffins. So, 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used for her own consumption. So, 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left. Then, she sells the rest. So, 9 * 2 = 18. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the answer is $18.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18}

Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins:
\[
3 \text{ (breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[
16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (used eggs)} = 9 \text{ (eggs sold)}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:
\[
9 \text{ (eggs sold)} \times 2 \text{ (dollars per egg)} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market.
