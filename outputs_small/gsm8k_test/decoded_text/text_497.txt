Q: Paul is driving a car twice a day: in the morning, and in the afternoon. He did that for 14 days. Each morning ride cost him about $6, and each afternoon ride, about $2. How much money did he spend on driving his car during these two weeks?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Paul is driving his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He did this for 14 days. Each morning ride costs him about $6, and each afternoon ride costs about $2. The question is asking how much money he spent on driving his car during these two weeks.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how many times he drives his car in total. Since he drives twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, over 14 days, that should be 2 rides per day multiplied by 14 days. Let me write that down:

Total rides = 2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 rides.

So, he drives his car 28 times in total. Now, each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. So, I need to calculate the total cost for all the morning rides and all the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Let me calculate the morning rides first. He drives in the morning 14 times, right? Because he does it once a day for 14 days. So, the cost for the mornings would be:

Morning cost = 14 rides * $6/ride = $84.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the afternoon rides. He also drives in the afternoon 14 times, once a day for 14 days. So, the cost for the afternoons would be:

Afternoon cost =14 rides * $2/ride = $28.

Wait, let me double-check that. 14 rides times $2 is indeed $28. So, $28 for the afternoons.

Now, to find the total amount he spent, I need to add the morning cost and the afternoon cost together.

Total cost = Morning cost + Afternoon cost = $84 + $28.

Hmm, adding those together. $84 plus $28 is $112. So, the total amount he spent is $112.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 14 days, 2 rides each day, so 28 total rides. Each morning ride is $6, so 14 rides in the morning would be 14*6=84, and 14 rides in the afternoon would be 14*2=28. Then, 84+28=112. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I could think of it as 14 days, each day he spends 6+2=8 dollars on driving. So, 14 days * $8/day = $112. That's another way to look at it and it also gives the same result.

So, both methods give me $112. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward: two rides a day, two different costs for morning and afternoon, total over 14 days. So, 28 rides total, each day 2 rides, each ride has a different cost, so total cost is 14*6 +14*2=84+28=112.

Yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any other factors or complexities here. It's a simple multiplication and addition problem.

**Final Answer**
The total amount Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \boxed{112} dollars.

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. 

First, we calculate the total number of rides:
\[
\text{Total rides} = 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the morning rides:
\[
\text{Morning cost} = 14 \text{ rides} \times \$6/\text{ride} = \$84
\]

Then, we calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
\[
\text{Afternoon cost} = 14 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$28
\]

Adding the morning and afternoon costs together gives the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$84 + \$28 = \$112
\]

Thus, the total amount Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \boxed{112} dollars.
