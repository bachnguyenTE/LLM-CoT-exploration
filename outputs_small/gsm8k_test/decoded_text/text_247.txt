She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?

Okay, so Isabelle bought some party supplies for her little sister's birthday party. I need to figure out how much each person—Isabelle and her two parents—paid in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the expenses she incurred:

1. Ingredients for the cake: $12
2. Birthday presents: $43
3. Decorations: $15
4. Invitations: $4
5. Goodie bags: $22

I think I need to add up all these costs to find the total amount spent. Let me write them down:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)

Hmm, let me add them one by one.

Starting with the first two: $12 + $43. That should be $55, right? Because 12 plus 40 is 50, and then plus 3 is 53. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 12 plus 43. Let me do it properly.

12 + 43: 10 + 40 is 50, and 2 + 3 is 5, so total is $55. Okay, that's correct.

Now, adding the next expense: $55 (from cake and presents) + $15 (decorations). So, 55 + 15 is 70. That seems right.

Next, adding the cost of invitations: $70 + $4. That's straightforward, 70 + 4 is 74.

Then, finally, adding the cost of goodie bags: $74 + $22. Hmm, 74 + 20 is 94, and then plus 2 more is 96. So, total is $96.

Wait, let me double-check that addition because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Starting over:

12 (cake) + 43 (presents) = 55

55 + 15 (decorations) = 70

70 + 4 (invitations) = 74

74 + 22 (goodie bags) = 96

Yes, that's correct. So, the total amount spent is $96.

Now, Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents. That means the total amount is divided by 3 people. So, I need to divide $96 by 3.

Let me do that: 96 divided by 3.

3 goes into 9 three times, so 3. Then, 3 goes into 6 two times. So, 32. So, 32.

Wait, 3 times 32 is 96. Yes, that's correct.

So, each person paid $32.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in adding up the costs. Sometimes when I do multiple additions, I might have missed something.

Let me add the amounts again:

12 (cake) + 43 (presents) = 55

55 + 15 (decorations) = 70

70 + 4 (invitations) = 74

74 + 22 (goodie bags) = 96

Yes, that's correct. So, total is $96.

Divided by 3 people: 96 / 3 = 32.

So, each person paid $32.

I think that's the answer. Let me just think if there's any other way to interpret the problem. It says she split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. So, that's three people in total, right? So, 96 divided by 3 is 32. So, each person paid $32.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The addition seems correct, and the division is straightforward. So, yeah, each person paid $32.

**Final Answer**
Each person paid \boxed{32} dollars.
