Okay, so I have this problem here where James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A, some to District B, and 209 newspapers to District C. The question is asking how many newspapers he delivers to District B. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers each day. That's the total number. Now, he delivers 198 to District A and 209 to District C. So, if I can find out how many he delivers to District B, that should be the answer. 

I think the way to approach this is by subtracting the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total. So, if I add up the newspapers delivered to A and C, and then subtract that sum from the total, I should get the number for B. Let me write that down.

Total newspapers = 600

Newspapers to A = 198

Newspapers to C = 209

So, the newspapers to B would be Total - (A + C). Let me compute A + C first.

198 + 229. Hmm, let me add those numbers. 198 plus 229. Let's see, 198 plus 200 is 418, and then plus 9 more is 427. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 198 + 229. Maybe I should add the units place first: 8 + 9 is 17, carry over 1. Then tens place: 9 + 2 is 11, plus the carried over 1 is 12, carry over 1. Then hundreds place: 1 + 2 is 3, plus carried over 1 is 4. So, yes, 198 + 229 is 427. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right because 198 + 229 is actually 427? Wait, 198 + 200 is 398, plus 29 is 427. Yeah, that's correct.

So, A + C is 427. Now, subtract that from the total, which is 600. So, 600 - 427. Let me compute that. 600 minus 400 is 200, and then minus 27 is 173. So, 600 - 427 is 173.

Wait, let me verify that subtraction. 427 plus 173 should equal 600. 427 + 173: 400 + 100 is 500, 20 + 70 is 90, 7 + 3 is 10. So, 500 + 90 is 590, plus 10 is 600. Yes, that checks out.

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is 173.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the addition and subtraction. Sometimes when I do mental math, I can slip up.

Starting again, 198 + 229. Let's add the units: 8 + 9 is 17, carryover 1. Then tens: 9 + 2 is 11, plus 1 is 12, carryover 1. Then hundreds: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 1 is 4. So, 427. That's correct.

Then, 600 - 427. Let's do this another way. 600 - 400 is 220, but wait, 427 is 400 + 27. So, 600 - 400 is 160, then subtract 27: 160 - 27. 160 - 20 is 140, then subtract 7 more is 133. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, hold on, I must have messed up the subtraction.

Wait, 600 - 427. Let me write it down:

600
-427
------

Starting from the units place: 0 - 7. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 0, so we have to go to the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 6, so borrow
