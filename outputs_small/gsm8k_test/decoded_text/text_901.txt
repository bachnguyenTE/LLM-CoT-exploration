Q: Calvin is making soup for his family for dinner. He has a pot with enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?

Okay, so Calvin is making soup for his family, and I need to figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Calvin has a pot that can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. Hmm, so the pot's capacity is equivalent to either four adults or eight children. That means the pot can hold the same amount of soup whether it's filled by adult bowls or child bowls. I think this is important because it relates the amount of soup to adults and children.

Next, Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. So, let's count how many people are coming for lunch. Calvin is one adult, his wife is another adult, and they have two children. So that's 1 adult + 1 adult + 2 children = 4 people in total.

Each person is going to eat one bowl at a meal. So, if there are four people, each eating one bowl, that would be four bowls consumed at the meal. But the question is about leftover soup. So, we need to figure out how much soup is left after everyone has eaten, and then determine how many times each child can have a bowl from that leftover.

Wait, but the pot's capacity is given in terms of adult bowls or child bowls. So, maybe I need to convert the total soup into a common unit, like child bowls or adult bowls, to make the calculations easier.

Let me think. If the pot can fill four adult bowls, that's equivalent to 4 adult bowls. Similarly, it can fill eight child bowls. So, the pot's capacity is 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. That means if I convert everything into child bowls, the pot can hold 8 child bowls. Alternatively, if I convert everything into adult bowls, it can hold 4 adult bowls.

But since Calvin is an adult, and he's going to eat with his wife and children, maybe it's better to think in terms of adult bowls because that's the primary person eating. Let me try that.

So, the pot can hold 4 adult bowls. Each adult bowl is equivalent to how much? If 4 adult bowls equal 8 child bowls, then each adult bowl is equal to 2 child bowls. So, 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls.

Therefore, the pot's capacity is 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls.

Now, let's figure out how much soup is consumed at the meal. Calvin, his wife, and their two children are all eating one bowl each. So, that's 4 people, each eating 1 bowl. So, 4 bowls are consumed.

But wait, the pot is being used for the meal, so the soup consumed is 4 bowls. But the pot's capacity is 8 child bowls. So, the leftover soup is 8 child bowls - 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The pot can hold 8 child bowls, and 4 child bowls are consumed. So, 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls left. So, 4 child bowls are leftover.

But the question is, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup? So, we have 4 child bowls left, and there are two children. So, each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of fractions of the pot. If the pot can hold 4 adult bowls, and each adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, then the pot can hold 8 child bowls. So, the total soup is 8 child bowls.

At the meal, 4 child bowls are consumed, so 8 - 4 = 4 child bowls are left. There are two children, so each child can have 4 / 2 = 2 bowls.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, "how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?" So, does it mean how many times each child can have a bowl, or how many bowls each child can have from the leftover?

I think it's the former: how many times each child can have a bowl. So, if there are 4 child bowls left, and two children, each child can have 2 bowls. So, the answer is 2.

But let me think again. Maybe I should consider the total soup in terms of adult bowls. So, the pot can hold 4 adult bowls. If Calvin is an adult, his wife is another adult, and they have two children. So, 4 people in total.

Each person is going to eat one bowl, so 4 bowls consumed. The
