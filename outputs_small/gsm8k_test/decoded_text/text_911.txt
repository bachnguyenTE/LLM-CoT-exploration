Okay, so Colby works for a manufacturing company, specifically in the packaging division. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. The question is asking how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday if he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how many packages Colby completes per hour. The problem says he completes 10 less than 55 packages. Wait, 10 less than 55? That seems a bit confusing. Is it 10 less than 55? Because 10 is a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo? Let me check the original question again. It says, "he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour." So, 50 packages per hour minus 10. So, 55 minus 10? That would be 45 packages per hour. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 55 - 10 = 45. So, he completes 45 packages each hour.

Now, he gets paid $0.20 for every package. So, to find out how much he earns per hour, I need to multiply the number of packages by the pay per package. So, 45 packages times $0.20 per package. Let me calculate that. 45 times 0.20. Hmm, 45 times 0.20. Well, 45 times 0.2 is 9, and 45 times 0.02 is 0.90. So, adding those together, 9 + 0.90 is 9.90. So, he earns $9.90 per hour.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 45 times 0.20. Alternatively, 45 times 20 cents. 45 times 20 is 990 cents, which is $9.90. Yeah, that's correct. So, he makes $9.90 per hour.

Now, he works for a typical eight-hour workday. So, to find his total earnings for the day, I need to multiply his hourly rate by 8. So, $9.90 per hour times 8 hours. Let me compute that. 9.90 times 8. 9 times 8 is 72, and 0.90 times 8 is 7.20. So, adding those together, 72 + 7.20 is 79.20. So, $79.20.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication another way. 9.90 times 8. 9.90 is the same as 990 cents. 990 times 8 is 7920 cents, which is 79.20 dollars. Yep, that's correct.

So, putting it all together: he completes 45 packages per hour, earns $9.90 per hour, and over an 8-hour day, he earns $79.20.

I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. He gets paid $0.20 per package. He completes 10 less than 55, which is 45. So, 45 times 0.20 is 9.90. Then, 9.90 times 8 is 79.20. So, yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key steps were figuring out the number of packages per hour, calculating the hourly rate, and then scaling it up to an 8-hour day. It's straightforward once you break it down step by step.

Just to make sure, let me think about another way. If he completes 45 packages each hour, and he works 8 hours, how many packages does he complete in total? 45 times 8. 45 times 8 is 360 packages. Then, each package is worth $0.20, so 360 times 0.20. 360 times 0.20 is 72.00, which is $72.00. Wait, that's different from the previous total. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on. There's a discrepancy here. Earlier, I got $79.20, but now I'm getting $72.00. That can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me check the first calculation again. 45 packages per hour times $0.20 per package is 4
