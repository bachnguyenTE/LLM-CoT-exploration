Q: John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John collecting garbage from three different apartment complexes. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how much money he makes in a week. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem says there are three apartment complexes. The first two each have 200 apartments. So, that's 200 apartments for the first one and 200 for the second. The third one is 60% bigger than the other two combined. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many apartments are in the third complex.

Let me write that down. The first complex has 200 apartments, the second also has 200. So combined, that's 200 + 200. Let me calculate that: 200 + 200 is 400. So, the third complex has 60% bigger than 400 apartments. Wait, 60% bigger than 400? That seems like a lot. Let me think about how to calculate that.

If something is 60% bigger than another number, you take the original number and add 60% of it to it. So, 60% of 400 is... let me compute that. 60% is 0.60 in decimal, so 0.60 * 400. Let me do that multiplication. 0.60 * 400. Hmm, 0.6 * 400 is 240, and 0.06 * 400 is 24, so total is 240 + 24 = 264. So, 60% of 400 is 264. Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 264 = 664 apartments. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400. 0.6 * 400 is 240, right? Because 0.6 * 400 is 240. So, 400 + 240 is 640. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 60% of 400 is 0.6 * 400 = 240. So, 400 + 240 is 640. So, the third complex has 640 apartments. Wait, but the problem says it's 60% bigger than the other two combined. So, the other two combined are 400, so 60% bigger is 400 + 60% of 400, which is 400 + 240 = 640. So, yes, 640 apartments. Okay, that makes sense.

So, summarizing:

- First complex: 200 apartments
- Second complex: 200 apartments
- Third complex: 640 apartments

Let me add those up to make sure. 200 + 200 is 400, plus 640 is 1040 apartments in total across all three complexes.

But wait, the question is about how much he makes in a week. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. So, each complex he collects 3 times, and each time he gets paid $0.40 per apartment.

So, first, I need to figure out how many apartments he collects each week from each complex, then multiply by $0.40, and then add them all up.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the number of collections per week from each complex.
2. Multiply each by $0.40 to get the weekly earnings from each.
3. Sum them all to get the total weekly earnings.

So, starting with the first complex: 200 apartments, collected 3 times a week. So, 200 * 3 = 600 collections. Each collection is $0.40, so 600 * 0.40.

Similarly, the second complex is the same: 200 * 3 = 600 collections, so 600 * 0.40.

Third complex: 640 apartments, 3 times a week. So, 640 * 3 = 1920 collections. 1920 * 0.40.

So, let me compute each of these.

First, 200 * 3 = 6
