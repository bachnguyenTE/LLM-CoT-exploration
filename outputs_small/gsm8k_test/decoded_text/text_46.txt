Q: Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Candice and her post-it notes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she went to work. Then, on her way to work, she stopped at a store and bought a package of post-it notes. After that, at work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. In the end, she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall. The question is, how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, initially, she had 80 post-it notes. Then she bought a package, which I assume is some number of post-it notes, let's call that number x. So, after buying the package, she would have 80 + x post-it notes in total.

Then, at work, she placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. So, that means she used 220 post-it notes at work. So, after using them, she would have 80 + x - 220 post-it notes left.

But the problem says she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall. So, that means 80 + x - 220 = 23.

Wait, let me write that equation down to make it clearer:

80 + x - 220 = 23

So, solving for x, which is the number of post-it notes in the package.

Let me compute 80 - 220 first. 80 minus 220 is... Hmm, 80 minus 200 is 100, so 80 minus 220 is 120? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 is less than 220, so it's negative. So, 80 - 220 is -140.

So, -140 + x = 23

Then, adding 140 to both sides, x = 23 + 140, which is 163.

Wait, so x is 163? Let me check that again.

She started with 80, bought x, so total is 80 + x. Then she used 220, so 80 + x - 220 = 23.

So, 80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplify 80 - 220: that's -140, so -140 + x = 23

Then, x = 23 + 140 = 163.

So, the package had 163 post-it notes.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again.

She started with 80, bought 163, so total is 243. Then she used 220, so 243 - 220 = 23. Yeah, that adds up. So, 243 - 220 is 23. So, that seems correct.

But wait, 163 is a lot of post-it notes. Is that realistic? Maybe, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the number of post-it notes in the package, so maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

She put 80 in her purse. Then, on her way to work, she bought a package. So, the package is separate from the 80? Or is the 80 part of the package? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says: "Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop." Then, "On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes." So, the 80 is separate from the package. So, she had 80, bought x, so total is 80 + x. Then, at work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220. So, 80 + x - 220 = 23.

So, 80 + x - 220 = 23. So, x = 23 + 140 = 163. So, 163 is the number of post-it notes in the package.

So, yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 163.

Wait, but
