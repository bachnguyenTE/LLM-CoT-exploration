Q: A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a toy manufacturer receiving an order for 400 toys. There are 5 workers available to work on the order. Two of them produce 6 toys each hour, and the other two produce 4 toys each hour. All workers work for 10 hours during their shift. By the end of the shift, they still need another 20 toys to ship the order. The question is asking how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the total order is 400 toys. But by the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys. That means that by the end of the 10-hour shift, they only have 440 - 22 = 418 toys left? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the order is 400 toys. They need another 22 toys to ship. So, the total toys they have produced by the end of the shift is 440 - 22 = 418 toys. So, they have 418 toys after 10 hours. So, the total toys produced during the shift is 418.

But wait, the problem says they have 400 toys, and they need another 22. So, 440 - 22 = 418. So, they have 418 toys after 10 hours. So, the total toys produced during the shift is 418.

But wait, the two workers produce 6 toys each hour, so each of those two workers produce 6 toys per hour. So, two workers at 6 toys per hour would be 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour. Similarly, the other two workers produce 4 toys each hour, so 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

So, if the first four workers produce 20 toys per hour, and they work for 10 hours, then the total toys produced by them during the shift is 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

But wait, if they have 418 toys after 10 hours, and they produced 200 toys during the shift, then the toys produced by the fifth worker must be 418 - 200 = 218 toys over 10 hours. So, the fifth worker produces 218 / 10 = 21.8 toys per hour.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.

Total order: 440 toys.

They need another 22 toys to ship, so they need to produce 440 - 22 = 418 toys.

Total time: 10 hours.

First four workers: 2 workers at 6 toys per hour each, so 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.

Another 2 workers: 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

Total for first four: 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

Over 10 hours, they produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

So, toys produced by fifth worker: 418 - 200 = 218 toys over 10 hours.

So, 218 / 10 = 21.8 toys per hour.

Hmm, 21.8 is 21 and 4/5, which is 21.8. So, 21.8 toys per hour.

Wait, but 21.8 seems like a lot. Let me see if I interpreted the problem correctly.

Wait, the problem says they receive an order for 400 toys. Wait, hold on, is that 400 or 440? Let me check the original problem.

"A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?"

Wait, so the order is 400 toys. So, 400 toys. Then, they need another 22 toys to ship. So, 400 - 22 = 378 toys produced during the shift.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let
