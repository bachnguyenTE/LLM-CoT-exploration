Q: Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?

Okay, so Mrs. Cruz is looking to buy a house, but she has a budget of $40,0000. Hmm, wait, that seems like a typo. It should probably be $400,0000. Let me check the original question again. It says $400,0000. Hmm, maybe it's $400,0000? I think that's a typo for $400,000. Let me go with that. So, her budget is $400,000.

She saw a property that sells for $350,000. Okay, so the selling price is $350,000. Now, on top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also a transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. So, I need to calculate the total additional costs and then see how much more that is than her budget.

First, let me write down the numbers:

- Selling price: $350,0000
- Brokerage fee: 5% of selling price
- Transfer fee: 12% of selling price

So, the total additional cost is 5% + 12% = 17% of the selling price.

Let me compute 17% of $350,000.

First, I can convert 17% to a decimal, which is 0.17.

So, 0.17 * 350,000.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 10% of 350,000 is 35,000.

So, 10% is 35,000.

Then, 7% is 24,500 because 10% is 35,000, so 1% is 3,500, so 7% is 24,500.

So, 17% is 35,000 + 24,500 = 59,500.

Wait, that seems off because 17% of 350,000 is 24,500, and 10% is 35,000, so 17% is 35,000 + 24,500 = 59,500.

Wait, but 17% of 350,000 is 59,500.

Wait, let me verify that.

Alternatively, 10% is 35,000, 5% is 17,500, so 17% is 35,000 + 17,500 = 52,500.

Wait, now I'm confused. Which is correct?

Wait, 10% is 35,000, so 1% is 3,500, so 7% is 24,500. So, 10% + 7% is 35,000 + 24,500 = 59,500.

But 17% is 10% + 7%, so 35,000 + 24,500 = 59,500.

Wait, so 17% of 350,000 is 59,500.

Wait, but 17% of 350,000 is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, but 350,000 is 350,000, so 17% is 59,500.

Wait, I
