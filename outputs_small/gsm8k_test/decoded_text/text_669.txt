Q: For every muffin, Svetlana needed 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 of a tablespoon of salt. How many tablespoons of dry ingredients would Svetlana need to make 16 muffins?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Svetlana and her muffins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how many tablespoons of dry ingredients she would need to make 16 muffins. The ingredients mentioned are flour, sugar, and salt. 

First, I need to understand the quantities required for one muffin. The problem states that for each muffin, she needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt. So, for each muffin, these are the amounts. 

Now, since she's making 16 muffins, I guess I need to multiply each of these quantities by 16 because 16 is 10 times 16. Wait, no, actually, 16 is 16 times 1, so I should multiply each ingredient by 16. Let me write that down.

Starting with flour: 5 tablespoons per muffin. So, for 16 muffins, it would be 5 * 16. Let me calculate that. 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 6 is 30, so 50 + 30 is 85. So, 85 tablespoons of flour.

Next, sugar: 3 tablespoons per muffin. So, 3 * 16. Hmm, 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 6 is 18, so 30 + 18 is 54. So, 54 tablespoons of sugar.

Then, salt: 0.25 tablespoons per muffin. So, 0.25 *16. Let me think, 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 16 is 1.5. So, 1.5 tablespoons of salt.

Now, to find the total tablespoons of dry ingredients, I need add up the tablespoons of flour, sugar, and salt. So, 85 + 54 + 1.5. Let me add 85 and 54 first. 85 + 54 is 139. Then, adding 1.5 to that, 139 + 1.5 is 140.5. So, 140.5 tablespoons in total.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

For flour: 5 *16. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 +30 is 80. Wait, hold on, that's 80, not 85. Did I do that right earlier? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 5 *16: 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 +30 is 80. So, 80 tablespoons of flour. Then, sugar: 3*16. 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, so 30 +18 is 48. So, 48 tablespoons of sugar. Salt: 0.25*16. 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 16 is 1.5. So, 1.5 tablespoons of salt.

Now, adding them up: 80 +48 is 128, plus 1.5 is 129.5. Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, I think I messed up the initial multiplication. Let me do it again.

Flour: 5 tablespoons per muffin. 5*16. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 +30 is 85. So, 85. That seems correct.

Sugar: 3*16. 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, so 30 +18 is 48. So, 48. Wait, 3*16 is 18, so 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, so 30 +18 is 54. Wait, no, 3*16 is 48, not 54. Wait, 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, so 30 +18 is 48. So, 48.

Wait, so earlier I thought 3*16 is 1
