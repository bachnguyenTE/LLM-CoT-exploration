Q: John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.  How much does he spend on everything?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John buys 10 bottles of scotch and twice as many bottles of cognac. The total cost for the scotch is $600. Cognac is priced at 50% more per bottle than scotch. I need to figure out how much he spends in total on both scotch and cognac. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600. So, if I divide the total cost by the number of bottles, that should give me the price per bottle. Let me write that down:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $66 per bottle.

Okay, so each bottle of scotch costs $66. Now, he also buys twice as many bottles of cognac. Twice as many as 10 bottles would be 20 bottles. So, he buys 20 bottles of cognac. But the price per bottle of cognac is 50% more than scotch. Hmm, so I need to calculate the increased price.

First, let me find out what 50% of $66 is. Because the scotch is $66 per bottle, right? So, 50% of $66 is:

50% of 66 = 0.50 * 66
Let me compute that. 0.5 * 66 is 33, and 0.05 *66 is 3, so total is 33 + 3 = $3.30.

So, the additional cost per bottle for cognac is $3.30. Therefore, the price per bottle of cognac is:

Price per cognac bottle = Price per scotch bottle + 50% increase
= $66 + $3.30
= $69.30 per bottle.

Alright, so each bottle of cognac costs $69.30. Now, he buys 20 bottles of cognac. So, the total cost for cognac is:

Total cost for cognac = Number of bottles * Price per bottle
= 20 * $69.30

Hmm, let me compute that. 20 times 60 is 1200, and 20 times 9.30 is 186. So, adding those together, 1200 + 186 = $1,386.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. 20 bottles at $69.30 each. So, 20 * 69.30. Let me compute 20 * 60 = 1200, and 20 * 9.30 = 186. So, 1200 + 186 is indeed 1386. So, $1,386 for cognac.

Now, the total amount John spends is the cost of scotch plus the cost of cognac. The scotch was $660, and cognac is $1,386. So, adding those together:

Total cost = Cost of scotch + Cost of cognac
= $660 + $1,386
= $2,046.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 10 bottles of scotch at $66 each is 10*66=660, that's correct. Cognac is twice as many, so 20 bottles. Each is 50% more, so 66 + 3.30=69.30. 20*69.30. Let me compute 20*69.30.

Alternatively, 20*69.30 can be broken down as 20*60 + 20*3.30. Wait, 20*66 is 1200, and 20*3.30 is 66. So, 1200 + 66=1266. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, hold on, 20*69.30 is 20*(60 + 3.30)=20*66 + 20*3.30=1200 + 66=1266. Wait, but that can't be right because 20*69.30 is 1266,
