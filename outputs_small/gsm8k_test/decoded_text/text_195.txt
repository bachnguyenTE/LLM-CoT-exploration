Okay, so I have this problem here: A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much will 8 pens cost? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. It says a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, if I let the cost of a pen be P, then P equals the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser. Got that. So, P = pencil + eraser.

They also give me the costs of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30. So, substituting those values in, P = 1.20 + 0.30. Let me calculate that. 1.20 plus 0.30 is... 1.50. So, each pen costs $1.50. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, the question is asking how much 8 pens will cost. So, if each pen is $1.50, then 8 pens would cost 8 times that amount. Let me write that down: Total cost = 8 * P. Since P is $1.50, then Total cost = 8 * 1.50.

Hmm, let me compute that. 8 times 1.50. Let me break it down. 8 times 1 is 8, and 8 times 0.50 is 4. So, adding those together, 8 + 4 is 12. So, 8 * 1.50 is $12.00. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, I can think of 1.50 as 150 cents. So, 8 times 150 cents. 150 * 8. Let me compute that. 100*8=800, 50*8=400, 2*8=16. So, 800 + 400 is 1200, plus 16 is 1216 cents. Converting back to dollars, 1216 cents is $12.16. Wait, that's different from my first calculation. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me go back. So, 8 * 1.50. 1.50 is the same as 1 dollar and 50 cents. So, 8 * 1 is 8, and 8 * 0.50 is 4. So, 8 + 4 is 12. So, that's $12.00. But when I converted to cents, I got $12.16. That can't be right because 1.50 *8 is 12.00, not 12.16. So, I must have messed up the cents calculation.

Wait, 1.50 is 150 cents. 150 *8 is 1200 cents, which is $12.00. So, that's correct. So, why did I get 1216 cents? Maybe I added incorrectly. Let me recalculate 150*8. 100*8=800, 50*8=400, so 800+400=1200. So, 1200 cents is $12.00. So, that's correct. So, the first method was correct, and the second method was wrong because I added 100*8, 50*8, and 2*8, which is incorrect because 150 is 100 + 50, not 100 +50 +2. So, that was a mistake.

So, the correct total cost is $12.00 for 8 pens. So, the answer should be $12.00.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. The problem says a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, P = pencil + eraser. So, P = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50. So, each pen is $1.50. Then, 8 pens would be 8 * 1.50. So, 8 *1.50 is 12.00. So, that seems correct.
