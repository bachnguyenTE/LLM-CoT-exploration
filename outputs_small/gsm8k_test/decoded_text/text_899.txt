Q: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susan’s nephews get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and she wanted to equally divide them among her 6 nephews. But then her husband sneaked 4 cookies for himself. Now, I need to figure out how many cookies each nephew will get after the husband took his share. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, Susan originally planned to split 100 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew would get, I should divide 100 by 6. Let me write that down:

100 ÷ 6

Hmm, 6 goes into 100 how many times? Let me do the division. 6 times 16 is 36, which is less than 100. Wait, no, 6 times 16 is 96, right? Because 6 times 10 is 6, 6 times 6 is 36, so 6 times 16 is 96. So, 6 times 16 is 96, which is less than 100. Wait, no, 6 times 16 is 96, but 6 times 16 is 96, but 6 times 16 is 96, but 6 times 16 is 96. So, 6 times 16 is 96, so 6 times 16 is 96. So, 6 times 16 is 96, so 6 times 16 is 96. So, 100 minus 96 is 4. So, 100 divided by 6 is 16 with a remainder of 4. So, each nephew would get 16 and 4/6 cookies, which simplifies to 16 and 2/3 cookies each. But since you can't really have a third of a cookie, Susan probably wouldn't split them that way. Maybe she just gave each nephew 16 cookies and kept the remaining 4 for herself? Wait, no, the husband took 4 cookies for himself. So, Susan didn't keep any for herself; she gave all the cookies to her nephews. So, maybe I need to adjust that.

Wait, let me read the problem again. Susan made 100 cookies and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susan’s nephews get?

So, Susan made 100 cookies, gave 100 to her nephews, and then her husband took 4 for himself. So, the total number of cookies given to the nephews is 100 minus 4, which is 96. So, Susan's nephews now have 96 cookies to divide among themselves. There are 6 nephews, so each one gets 96 divided by 6.

Let me calculate that: 96 ÷ 6. 6 goes into 96 how many times? 6 times 16 is 96, right? So, each nephew gets 16 cookies.

Wait, so initially, Susan planned to give each nephew 16 and 2/3 cookies, but then her husband took 4, so the total given to the nephews is 96, which is 16 each. So, each nephew gets 16 cookies.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Susan made 100 cookies, her husband took 4, so 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left. 96 divided by 6 is 16. So, each nephew gets 16. That seems right.

Alternatively, if Susan had kept the 4 cookies for herself, then she would have 100 cookies to give to her 6 nephews, which would be 100 ÷ 6, which is 16 with a remainder of 4, so each gets 16 and 4/6, which is 16 and 2/3. But the problem says her husband took 4 cookies for himself, so Susan didn't keep any for herself. So, the 4 cookies are taken by the husband, so Susan's nephews only get 96, which is 16 each.

So, the answer is 16 cookies each.

Wait, but let me think again. If Susan made 100 cookies, gave 100 to her nephews, and then her husband took 4, so the total given to the nephews is 100 - 4 = 96. So, 96 divided by 6 is 16.
