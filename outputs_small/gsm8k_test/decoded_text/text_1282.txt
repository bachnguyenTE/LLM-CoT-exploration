Q: John invited 20 people to a birthday party.  Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.  He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.  If a pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, how much does he need to spend on hot dogs?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John inviting 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Hot dogs are sold in packs of 6, each pack costing $2. I need to figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how many hot dogs John needs in total for the birthday party. He's inviting 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, I can calculate the total number of hot dogs needed by multiplying the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat. That would be 20 people multiplied by 2 hot dogs per person. Let me write that down:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

So, John needs 40 hot dogs in total for the party.

But wait, he already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. That means he doesn't need to buy all 40 hot dogs he needs for the party. Instead, he can use those 4 as a starting point. So, I need to subtract the 4 hot dogs he already has from the total he needs. Let me do that:

40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs already have = 36 hot dogs needed to buy.

So, John needs to buy 36 hot dogs. Now, the next step is to figure out how many packs of hot dogs he needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, I can divide the number of hot dogs he needs to buy by the number of hot dogs per pack to find out how many packs he needs.

36 hot dogs needed / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

So, John needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs. Now, each pack costs $2, so I can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack.

6 packs * $2 per pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 20 guests times 2 hot dogs each is 40. He already has 4, so 40 minus 4 is 36. Then, 36 divided by 6 is 6 packs. 6 packs times $2 is $12. Hmm, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the number of packs. 36 divided by 6 is indeed 6, because 6 times 6 is 36. So, that's correct. Each pack is $2, so 6 packs would be 6 times 2, which is 12. So, $12 is the total cost.

Is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating how many packs he needs without subtracting the already have. Let's see, he needs 40 hot dogs, and he has 4, so he needs 36. Each pack is 6, so 36 divided by 6 is 6 packs. So, same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of division, 40 divided by 6 is approximately 6.666 packs. But since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, you have to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs. But wait, hold on, that would be 7 packs, which is 42 hot dogs, but he only needs 40. So, that would mean he would have 2 extra hot dogs, which is more than he needs. But in this case, he already has 4, so he doesn't need 42. So, maybe that approach is not necessary here.

Wait, actually, if he buys 6 packs, that's 36 hot dogs, which is 40 minus 4. So, that's exactly the number he needs. So, 6 packs is correct. So, the initial approach is correct.

Another way to think about it is, how many sets of 6 are in 36. 36 divided by 6 is 6. So, that's correct.

So, I think my initial calculation is correct. He needs to buy 6 packs, each costing $2, so total cost is $12.

Wait, but let me make sure that 6 packs is the correct number. So, 6 packs times 6 hot dogs per pack is 36. 36 hot dogs is exactly the number he needs. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if he buys 7 packs, that would
