Q: A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sylvie and her salary increases at a company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the company pays each employee $600 every month. That's the initial salary. Now, the company has a policy where they increase the salaries of employees who have stayed for five years by 10% of the initial salary each year. Hmm, so that means every year, starting from the sixth year, their salary increases by 10% of $600. 

Wait, let me make sure I understand. So, the initial salary is $600. Every year, starting from the sixth year, they increase it by 10% of the initial salary. So, that's 10% of $600, which is... let me calculate that. 10% of 600 is 0.60, right? So, $6.60 each year. So, each year, starting from the sixth year, their salary increases by $6.60.

But wait, the problem says "10% of the initial salary every year." So, is it 10% of the initial salary, which is $600, or 10% of the current salary? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years." So, it's 10% of the initial salary, not the current one. So, that's a fixed amount each year, not a percentage of the current salary. So, that's $6.60 each year.

So, starting from the sixth year, each year, their salary increases by $6.60. So, each year, their salary is going up by a flat $6.60. So, that's a linear increase, not a percentage increase. So, that's important because if it was a percentage increase, it would be compounding, but here it's a flat $6.60 each year.

So, Sylvie has been with the company for five years. So, she has been with the company for 5 years, and now she's clocking three more years. So, she's going to have 3 more years of service. So, her total service is 8 years. So, she's been with the company for 8 years now.

Wait, but the question is asking for her annual salary after three more years of service. So, after three more years, so her current salary is after 5 years, and then we add three more years, so total 8 years. So, we need to find her salary after 8 years.

But wait, the problem is about her annual salary after three more years of service. So, does that mean her salary after 3 more years, or her annual salary after 3 more years? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me check.

"A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?"

So, she just clocked 5 years, so she has 5 years of service. Then, after three more years, so 8 years total. So, the question is asking for her annual salary after three more years of service. So, is it asking for her salary after 3 more years, or her annual salary during those 3 years?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "what's her annual salary after three more years of service?" So, perhaps it's asking for her annual salary at the end of those three years, meaning her salary after 3 more years, which would be 8 years total.

But let me think. If it's asking for her annual salary after three more years, that would be her salary at the end of the third year, which is 8 years total. So, we need to calculate her salary after 8 years.

But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for her annual salary during the three years, but that seems less likely because annual salary is a fixed amount. So, probably, it's asking for her salary after three more years, so 8 years total.

So, let's proceed with that assumption.

So, her initial salary is $600 per month. Then, every year, starting from the sixth year, her salary increases by 10% of the initial salary, which is $6.60. So, each year, her salary goes up
