Q: At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a trip to a county-level scavenger hunt competition. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, it says that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. So, initially, they had 90 people, but wait, no, 90 people. Hmm, okay, so 90 people went on the trip. Then, it mentions that they formed 9-person groups. So, each group has 9 people. 

Now, the next part says that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. Hmm, okay, so each group has 9 people, and each person brings back 2 seashells. So, if I can figure out how many groups there are, I can find out how many people are bringing seashells, and then multiply by 2 to get the total number of seashells.

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. It says 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, each group has 9 people, so the number of people bringing back seashells is 3/5 of the number of groups. So, if there are G groups, then 3/5 * G people are bringing back 2 seashells each.

So, first, I need to find out how many groups there are. Since there are 90 people and each group has 9 people, the number of groups is 90 divided by 9. Let me calculate that: 90 ÷ 9 is 10. So, there are 10 groups. Wait, 90 divided by 9 is 10? Let me check: 9 times 10 is 90, yes, that's correct.

So, there are 10 groups. Now, 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So, 3/5 of 10 groups. Let me compute that: 3/5 of 10 is (3/5)*10, which is 6. So, 6 people are bringing back 2 seashells each.

Wait, hold on, 3/5 of the number of groups. So, 3/5 of 10 is 6. So, 6 people are bringing back 2 seashells each. So, total seashells would be 6 * 2 = 12. But that seems too low. Wait, 6 people bringing back 2 each is 12 seashells. But 10 groups, 3/5 of them, which is 6 groups, each with 9 people, so 6*9=54 people bringing back 2 each, so 54 seashells. Wait, that's 54. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says: "3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each." So, it's 3/5 of the number of groups, not 3/5 of the number of people. So, if there are 10 groups, 3/5 of 10 is 6 groups. So, 6 groups each have 9 people, so 6*9=54 people bringing back 2 seashells each. So, 54 seashells in total.

Wait, but 3/5 of the number of groups is 6, so 6 groups each have 9 people, so 6*9=54 people bringing back 2 seashells each. So, 54*2=108 seashells. Wait, that's 108. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each." So, it's 3/5 of the number of groups, each group has 9 people, so 3/5 of the number of groups is the number of groups that are bringing back 2 seashells each. So, 3/5 of 10 is 6, so 6 groups each have 9 people, so 6*9=54 people bringing back 2 seashells each. So, 54*2=108 seashells.

Wait, but 10 groups, 3/5 of them is 6, so 6 groups each have 9 people, so 6*9=54 people bringing back 2 each. So, 54*2=108. So,
