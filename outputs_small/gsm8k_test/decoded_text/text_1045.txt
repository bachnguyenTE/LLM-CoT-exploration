Q: Three people divided an amount of $1920. The second took $80 more than the first and the third took twice what the second took. Calculate the share of the first one.

Okay, so I have this problem where three people divided $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third took twice what the second took. I need to find out how much the first person got. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably assign variables to each person's share to make it easier to work with. Let me call the first person's share "x." That seems like a good start. So, the first person took x dollars.

Now, the second person took $80 more than the first. Since I called the first person's share x, the second person must have taken x plus $80. So, the second person's share is x + 80. Wait, that seems a bit odd because 80 is just 80, right? So, the second person took x + 80 dollars.

Moving on to the third person, they took twice what the second person took. Since the second person took x + 80, the third person must have taken 2 times that amount. So, the third person's share is 2*(x + 80). Let me write that down: 2*(x + 80).

Now, the total amount they all took together is $1920. So, if I add up all three shares, it should equal 1920. Let me write that as an equation:

x (first person) + (x + 80) (second person) + 2*(x + 80) (third person) = 1920.

Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, I'll expand the third person's share:

2*(x + 80) = 2x + 160.

So now, the equation becomes:

x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920.

Now, let me combine like terms. Let's see, the x terms: x + x + 2x. That's 4x. Then the constants: 80 + 160. That's 240.

So, the equation simplifies to:

4x + 240 = 1920.

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with x.

4x = 1920 - 240.

Calculating that, 1920 minus 240 is 1680. So, 4x = 1680.

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x.

x = 1680 / 4.

Calculating that, 1680 divided by 4 is 420. So, x equals 420.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the first person took $420, then the second person took 420 + 80, which is 500. The third person took twice the second person's share, so 2*500 is 1000. Let me add them up: 420 + 500 + 1000. That's 420 + 500 is 970, plus 1000 is 1970. Wait, that's not 1920. Did I do something wrong?

Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through my steps.

I set the first person's share as x, so that's correct. The second person took x + 80, that seems right. The third person took 2*(x +80), which is 2x +160. Then, adding all three: x + (x +80) + (2x +160) = 1920.

Combining like terms: x + x + 2x is 4x, and 80 +160 is 240. So, 4x +240 =1920. Then, subtract 240: 4x=1680. Divide by 4: x=420.

But when I add them up, I get 420 +500 +1000=1920. Wait, 420 +500 is 970, plus 1000 is 1970. That's more than 1920. So, that can't be right.

Wait, so my mistake must be in the second person's share. Let me check that again. The second person took $80
