Q: Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many spoons Julia originally bought. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, Julia was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package. Let's call the number of spoons in that package "x". That makes sense because we don't know how many she originally had, so using a variable is a good idea.

Then, her husband came over and bought a new package with 5 spoons. He gave them to Julia, so Julia now has both her original package and her husband's package. So, the total number of spoons Julia has before she started cooking is x (from her own package) plus 5 (from her husband). So that's x + 5.

But wait, while Julia was making the stew, she used three spoons to sample her stew. So, she didn't have all the spoons at that point. She used three, so the number of spoons she had left would be the total she had minus the three she used. So, that would be (x + 5) - 3.

Then, later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. So, the number of spoons she had after using three is 12. So, we can set up an equation:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Let me write that down:

(x + 5) - 3 = 12

Simplify the left side:

x + 5 -3 =12

Which simplifies to:

x + 2 =12

So, to find x, we subtract 2 from both sides:

x =12 -2

x=10

So, Julia originally bought a package with 10 spoons.

Wait, let me double-check that. If she had 10, her husband gave her 5, so total is 15. She used 3, so 15-3=12. But wait, the problem says she had 12 spoons when she went to set the table. That doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Let me read the problem again.

"Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?"

Wait, so when she set the table, she had 12 spoons. So, let's see:

She had her own package, her husband's package, and then she used 3. So, the total she had before using any was (x +5). Then, she used 3, so (x +5 -3) =12.

So, x +5 -3=12? Wait, no, 12 is the total after using 3. So, x +5 -3=12.

So, x +2=12, so x=10.

But when I plug back in, 10 +5=15, minus 3=12. So, that's correct. So, she had 15, used 3, so 12 left. So, the package she bought was 10.

Wait, but the husband gave her 5, so she had 10 +5=15. Then, she used 3, so 12 left. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in the problem, it says she had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. Wait, no, the problem says she had a total of 12 spoons when she went to set the table. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought 12 was the total after using 3, but the problem says she had 12 when she went to set the table. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought 12 was the total after using 3, but the problem says she had 12 when she went to set the table. So, that's correct.

Wait, so maybe my initial confusion was because I thought 12 was the total after using 3, but no, 12 is the total after using 3. So, 12 is the total after using 3, so 12 is the total after subtracting 3. So, the equation is
