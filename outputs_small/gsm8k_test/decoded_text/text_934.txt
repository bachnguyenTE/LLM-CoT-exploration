Q: Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Zoey and Sydney having a watermelon seed spitting contest. The goal is to figure out the average total distance they spat. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Zoey has a watermelon with 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney has a watermelon with 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. They each have one watermelon, so I guess we need to calculate the total distance each of them spat and then find the average of those two totals.

Alright, let's start with Zoey. She has 40 seeds, and each one is spit 10 feet. So, to find the total distance Zoey spat, I think I need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance per seed. That makes sense because if you have more seeds, you'll spit further each time. So, 40 seeds times 10 feet per seed. Let me write that down:

Zoey's total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed

Hmm, 40 times 10. Let me calculate that. 40 * 10 is 400. So, Zoey spat a total of 400 feet.

Now, moving on to Sydney. She has 35 seeds, each spit 12 feet. So, similar to Zoey, I need to multiply the number of seeds by the distance per seed. So, 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed. Let me compute that.

Sydney's total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed

35 times 12. Hmm, 35*10 is 350, and 35*2 is 70, so adding those together, 350 + 70 is 420. So, Sydney spat a total of 420 feet.

Now, the problem asks for the average total distance spat. So, I think I need to find the average of Zoey's total and Sydney's total. That means I add their two totals together and then divide by 2.

Average total distance = (Zoey's total + Sydney's total) / 2

Plugging in the numbers:

Average total distance = (400 + 420)/2

Wait, hold on, 400 + 420 is 820? Let me check that again. 400 + 420. 400 + 400 is 800, but since Sydney is 420, which is 400 + 20, so 400 + 420 is 820? Wait, no, 400 + 420 is 820? Wait, 400 + 400 is 800, so 400 + 420 is 820? Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let's go with it for now.

So, 820 divided by 2 is 410. So, the average total distance is 410 feet.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 400 + 420 is 820, and 820 divided by 2 is indeed 410. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the multiplication steps. Let me go back.

Zoey: 40 seeds, each 10 feet. 40*10. 40*10 is 440? Wait, hold on, 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 400. Wait, 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 40, but 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 400, and 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 440? Wait, no, 40*10 is 440? Wait, 40*10 is 400, and 40*10 is 400, so 40*10 is 0? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 40*10. Let me think of it as 40*10 +
