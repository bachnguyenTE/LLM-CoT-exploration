Q: Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam’s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?

Okay, so Adam wants to ride this biggest roller coaster, and he needs to be 4 feet tall. Hmm, let me think about how to figure out how many years it will take him to grow tall enough. 

First, I know that the roller coaster requires 4 feet, but Adam's current height is given in inches. I should probably convert that to feet to make it easier to compare. I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches, so let me do that conversion.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall. To convert that to feet, I divide 40 by 12. Let me calculate that: 40 divided by 12. Hmm, 12 times 3 is 36, and 40 minus 36 is 4. So that's 3 feet and 4 inches. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 40 divided by 12 is actually 3.333... feet. Because 12 times 3 is 36, and 40 minus 36 is 4, so it's 3 and 4/12 feet, which simplifies to 3 and 1/3 feet. So, 3.333 feet.

But the roller coaster is 4 feet tall. So, Adam is currently 3.333 feet tall, and he needs to be 4 feet. So, how much more does he need to grow?

Let me subtract his current height from the required height. So, 4 feet minus 3.333 feet. That would be 0.6666... feet. So, he needs to grow an additional 0.6666... feet.

But he grows 2 inches every year. I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since he's growing in inches per year, I should convert the required growth from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 0.6666... feet times 12 inches per foot.

Let me calculate that: 0.6666... multiplied by 12. Hmm, 0.6666... is equal to 2/3. So, 2/3 times 122 is 2/3 times 12, which is 4/3, which is approximately 1.3333... inches. So, he needs to grow about 1.3333 inches over the years.

He grows 2 inches each year, so I need to find out how many years it takes for him to grow 1.3333 inches. Since he grows 2 inches per year, I can set up the equation:

2 inches/year * number of years = 1.3333 inches

So, number of years = 1.3333 / 2

Let me compute that: 1.3333 divided by 2 is 0.66665 years. So, approximately 0.66665 years.

But the question asks for how many years until he is tall enough. Since you can't have a fraction of a year in this context, I think we need to round up to the next whole year. So, 0.66665 years is about 8 months, so he would need to wait for the next full year.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with growth rates, it's easy to make a mistake.

Starting height: 40 inches. Convert to feet: 40 /12 = 3.3333 feet.

Desired height: 4 feet.

Difference: 4 - 3.3333 = 0.66667 feet.

Convert that difference to inches: 0.66667 *12 = 8 inches.

He grows 2 inches per year, so number of years = 8 /2 = 4 years.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial conversion. Let me go through it again.

Adam is 40 inches tall. 40 inches is equal to 40 /12 feet, which is 3 and 4/12 feet, which is 3 and 1/3 feet, which is 3.3333 feet.

Desired height is 4 feet.

Difference is 4 - 3.3333 = 0.66667 feet.

Convert 0.6667 feet to inches: 0.66667 *12 = 8 inches.

He grows 2 inches per year, so 8 /2 = 4 years.

So, that seems to
