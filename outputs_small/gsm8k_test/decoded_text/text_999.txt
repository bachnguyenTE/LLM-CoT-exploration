Q: A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where a family of 6, which includes 2 adults and 4 kids, are going to divide a watermelon. The rule is that each adult gets a slice that's twice as big as each kid. I need to figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably visualize the watermelon. It's a three-dimensional object, but when we talk about dividing it into slices, we're essentially dividing it into portions. Since it's a watermelon, it's symmetrical, so each slice should be equal in some way. But the problem specifies that each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid. So, I need to consider the sizes of the slices each adult and each kid get.

Let me denote the size of a kid's slice as, say, x. Then, each adult's slice would be 2x. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices would be 2 + 4 = 6 slices. Each slice is either x or 2x in size.

So, the total watermelon can be thought of as the sum of all these slices. That is, the total volume of the watermelon is equal to the sum of all the individual slices. So, if I let the total volume be V, then:

Total volume V = (number of kid slices) * x + (number of adult slices) * 2x

Plugging in the numbers, we have:

V = 4x + 2*(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x

So, the total volume is 8x. Now, each kid gets a slice of x, so each kid's portion is x. Each adult gets a slice of 2x, so each adult's portion is 2x.

But wait, the question is asking for the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. So, I need to find what percentage 2x is of the total volume V, which is 8x.

To find the percentage, I can use the formula:

Percentage = (Portion / Total) * 100

So, for each adult, the portion is 2x, and the total is 8x. Therefore:

Percentage = (2x / 8x) * 100

Simplify the fraction:

2x divided by 8x is equal to 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4.

So, 1/4 is 0.25 in decimal form. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

0.25 * 100 = 25%

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, each kid gets x, each adult gets 2x. There are 4 kids and 2 adults, so total slices are 4 + 2 =6. Each kid's slice is x, so 4x. Each adult's slice is 2x, so 2*2x=4x. So, total is 4x +4x=8x. So, each kid gets 4x/8x=0.5, which is 50% of the watermelon? Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 4x is the total for kids, so 4x is 50% of 8x. Similarly, each adult's portion is 4x, which is 50% of 8x as well. But that would mean each kid and each adult get 50% of the watermelon, which seems a bit high because there are more adults.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 4x is the total for kids, so 4x is 50% of 8x? Wait, no, 4x is half of 8x, so 4x is 50%? Wait, no, 4x is half of 8x, so 4x is 50% of 8x? Wait, no, 8x is the total. So, 4x is half of 8x, so 4x is 50% of 8x? Wait, no, 8x is the total, so 4x is half of that, so 50%? Wait, no, 4x is 50% of 8x? Wait, 8x is 100%, so 4x is 50%? Wait, no, 4x is half of 8x, so 50%? Wait, no, 8x is 100%, so 4x is 50%? Wait, no, 4x is half
