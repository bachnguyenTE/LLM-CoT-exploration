A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about George buying chips and candy bars from a vending machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that chips cost 40 cents and candy bars cost 75 cents. George spent a total of $5 and ended up with 1% of his money left. He bought 3 bags of chips. I need to find out how many candy bars he bought.

Alright, let's break this down. George spent $5, and he had 1% of his money left. So, that means he spent 99% of his money because 100% - 1% = 99%. 

Wait, let me make sure. If he had 1% left, then the amount he spent is 99% of his total money. So, if his total money was $5, then 99% of $5 is how much he spent. Let me calculate that.

99% of $5 is 0.99 * 5. Let me compute that. 0.99 * 5 is 4.95. So, he spent $4.95 in total.

Wait, but the problem says he bought 3 bags of chips. Each chip is 40 cents, so 3 chips would be 3 * 0.40. Let me calculate that. 3 * 0.40 is 1.20. So, he spent $1.20 on chips.

So, if he spent $1.20 on chips, and he spent a total of $4.95, then the rest must have been candy bars. So, the amount spent on candy bars is total spent minus chips spent. That is 4.95 - 1.20. Let me compute that.

4.95 - 1.20 is 3.75. So, he spent $3.75 on candy bars.

Now, each candy bar is 75 cents, which is 0.75 dollars. So, to find out how many candy bars he bought, I need to divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the price per candy bar.

So, 3.75 divided by 0.75. Let me compute that. 3.75 / 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 goes into 3.75 how many times? Well, 0.75 * 5 is 3.75, so that's 5 times. So, he bought 5 candy bars.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total money: $5. He spent 99%, which is 4.95. He bought 3 chips at 40 cents each, which is 1.20. So, 4.95 - 1.20 is 3.75. 3.75 divided by 0.75 is indeed 5. So, 5 candy bars.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says he bought 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. So, 1% of $5 is $0.05, right? So, he had $0.05 left. So, he spent $4.95. That's correct.

So, 3 chips at 40 cents each is 1.20, so 4.95 - 1.20 is 3.75, which is 5 candy bars at 75 cents each. So, that seems to add up.

Wait, just to make sure, let me add up the total cost. 3 chips at 40 cents is 1.20, 5 candy bars at 75 cents is 3.75. So, 1.20 + 3.75 is 4.95, which is 99% of $5. So, that's correct.

So, yeah, I think 5 is the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of candy bars George bought is \boxed{5}.
</think>

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his total money. 

First, we calculate 99% of $5:
\[
0.99 \times 5 = 4.95
\]
So, George spent $4.95 in total.

He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. The total cost for the chips is:
\[
3 \times 0.40 = 1.20
\]
