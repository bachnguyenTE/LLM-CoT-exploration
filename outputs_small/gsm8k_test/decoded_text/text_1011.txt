Q: A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

Okay, so I have this problem about Wanda and Ms. B pumping water into a tank. The tank can hold 18,000 gallons. They want to fill it in two days by working in shifts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, on the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. Hmm, so that's 1/4 of 18,000 gallons. Let me calculate that. 18,000 divided by 4 is... let me see, 18,000 ÷ 4. Well, 18,000 divided by 2 is 9,000, so divided by 4 is half of that, which is 4,500. So Wanda filled 4,500 gallons on the first day.

Then, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did that day. So if Wanda did 4,500, then Ms. B did 3/4 of that. Let me compute 3/4 of 4,500. So 4,500 multiplied by 3/4. 4,500 divided by 4 is 1,125, and then multiplied by 3 is 3,375. So Ms. B pumped 3,375 gallons on the first day.

So on the first day, together, they pumped 4,500 + 3,375. Let me add those up. 4,500 + 3,375 is 7,875. So together, they pumped 7,875 gallons on the first day.

Wait, but the tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons. So how much is left after the first day? 18,000 - 7,875. Let me subtract. 18,000 - 7,875. That's 1,125 gallons remaining after the first day.

Okay, moving on to the second day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she did on the previous day. So she did 2/3 of 4,500. Let me compute that. 4,500 divided by 3 is 1,500, and multiplied by 2 is 3,000. So Wanda pumped 3,000 gallons on the second day.

Then, Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. She did 3,375 on the first day, so 1/3 of that is 3,375 ÷ 3. Let me calculate that. 3,375 ÷ 3 is 1,125. So Ms. B pumped 1,125 gallons on the second day.

So on the second day, together, they pumped 3,000 + 1,125. Let me add those. 3,000 + 1,125 is 4,125. So they pumped 4,125 gallons on the second day.

Now, let's add up the total pumped over the two days. First day was 7,875, second day was 4,125. So 7,875 + 4,125. Let me add those. 7,000 + 4,000 is 11,000, and 875 + 125 is 100. So total pumped is 11,100 gallons.

Wait, but the tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons. So how much is left? 18,000 - 11,100. Let me subtract. 18,000 - 11,100. 18,000 minus 11,000 is 7,000, and then minus 100 is 6,898. So 6,898 gallons remaining.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again.

First day: Wanda did 1/4 of 18,000. 18,000 ÷ 4 is 4,500. Correct. Ms. B did 3/4 of that, which is 3,375. Correct. Together, 4,500 + 3,375 is
