Q: 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline did Josey need?

Okay, so I have this problem here: 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline did Josey need? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the problem says that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers. So, I think I need to find out how much gas is in each container. If it's equally divided, then I can just divide the total gallons by the number of containers. Let me write that down.

Total gallons = 15 gallons
Number of containers = 5
Gas per container = Total gallons / Number of containers = 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.

Wait, so each container has 3 gallons of gas? That seems right because 5 containers times 3 gallons each would give me 15 gallons total. Okay, that checks out.

Now, Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. So, I need to figure out how much gasoline that is in gallons first, and then convert that to pints. Let me break that down.

First, 1/4 of a container. Since each container is 3 gallons, then 1/4 of a container would be 3 gallons multiplied by 1/4. Let me calculate that.

Gas needed = 3 gallons * (1/4) = 3/4 gallons.

Hmm, 3/4 gallons. But the question asks for pints. I remember that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. So, I need to convert gallons to pints.

So, 3/4 gallons * 8 pints/gallon. Let me compute that.

3/4 * 8 = (3 * 8)/4 = 24/4 = 6 pints.

Wait, so Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Divided 15 gallons by 5 containers: 15/5 = 3 gallons per container. That seems correct.
2. Then, 1/4 of a container is 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons. That makes sense.
3. Converting gallons to pints: 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints. Yep, that seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by converting gallons to pints from the start? Let me try that method to verify.

1 gallon = 8 pints, so 15 gallons would be 15 * 8 = 120 pints. Then, since there are 5 containers, each container would have 120 / 5 = 24 pints. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 15 gallons divided by 5 containers is 3 gallons per container, which is 24 pints per container. Wait, 3 gallons is 24 pints? Wait, 3 gallons is 24 pints? No, wait, 1 gallon is 8 pints, so 3 gallons is 24 pints. So, each container is 24 pints. But Josey needs 1/4 of a container, so 24 pints * 1/4 = 6 pints. Okay, same answer. So that method also gives me 6 pints. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but in the first method, I thought of 1/4 container as 3/4 gallons, which is 24 pints, but that's not correct. Wait, no, 3 gallons is 24 pints, so 1/4 of that is 6 pints. So, that's correct.

Wait, hold on, in the first method, I thought 1/4 container is 3/4 gallons, which is 24 pints, but that's not correct because 3 gallons is 24 pints, so 1/4 of that is 6 pints. So, that's correct. So, both methods give me 6 pints. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but in the first method, I thought 1/4 container is 3/4 gallons, but that's actually 3 gallons * 1/4, which is 0.75 gallons, which is 6 pints. So, that's correct.

So, both methods lead me to the same answer, 6 pints. So, I think that's the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think about the units and conversions again.

Total gas: 15 gallons.

Divided into 5 containers: 15 /
