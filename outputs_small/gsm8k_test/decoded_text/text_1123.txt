Q: Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?

Okay, so I have this problem here about the weights of dogs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. The question is asking how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds.

Alright, so let me break this down. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs: one that's one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog, and another that's half the weight of Kory’s dog. So, I need to find the total weight of both of Elijah’s dogs and Kory’s dog combined.

First, let me figure out the weight of the first dog that Elijah has. It says it's one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. So, one-fourth of 60 pounds. Hmm, okay, so I can calculate that by dividing 60 by 4.

Let me write that down: 60 divided by 4. Let me do the division. 4 goes into 6 once, with a remainder of 2. Then bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So, 60 divided by 4 is 15. So, the first dog is 15 pounds.

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the second dog that Elijah has is half the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, so half of that would be 30 pounds. So, the second dog is 30 pounds.

Now, I need to find the total weight of both of Elijah’s dogs and Kory’s dog. So, that would be Kory’s dog plus the first dog plus the second dog.

So, let me add them up. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, the first dog is 15 pounds, and the second dog is 30 pounds. So, 60 plus 15 is 75, and then 75 plus 30 is 105. Wait, 60 plus 15 is 75, and 75 plus 30 is 105. So, the total weight is 105 pounds.

Wait, let me double-check that. 60 plus 15 is 75, yes. Then 75 plus 30 is 105. Hmm, that seems right. So, the total weight is 105 pounds.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. One-fourth of that is 15 pounds, which seems correct because 60 divided by 4 is 15. Then, half of 60 is 30 pounds, which is also correct. So, adding them up: 60 + 15 + 30. Let me add 60 and 15 first, which is 75, and then add 30 to that. 75 plus 30 is 105. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says "Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog." So, that's two dogs for Elijah, and one dog for Kory. So, total dogs are three: Kory’s and two of Elijah’s. So, the total weight is Kory’s dog plus both of Elijah’s dogs.

So, 60 + 15 + 30. 60 + 15 is 75, plus 30 is 105. So, 105 pounds. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says "Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog." So, that's two dogs for Elijah, each being a fraction of Kory’s dog. So, Kory’s dog is 60, so one is 15, another is 30. So, total for both is 15 + 30 = 45. Then, Kory’s dog is 60, so total is 60 + 45 = 105. Yeah, that's the same as before.

So, I think 105 pounds is the correct answer.

Wait, but just
