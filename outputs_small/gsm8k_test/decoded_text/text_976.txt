Q: Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pies over two days. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. Then, on Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday. Wait, but it also mentions that on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to parse this carefully.

Let me list out the information given:

- On Saturday:
  - gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
  - apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

- On Sunday:
  - gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
  - apple pie sold: 15 boxes

Wait, so on Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Since on Saturday he sold 10 boxes, then on Sunday, gingerbread sold would be 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. That makes sense.

Similarly, on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. But on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, if on Sunday he sold 15 boxes, then on Saturday he sold 15 boxes. Wait, but the problem says on Saturday he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, but does it say anything about apple pie on Saturday? Let me check.

The problem says: "On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday." So, on Saturday, gingerbread: 10 boxes, apple pie: 4 fewer than Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Sunday, gingerbread: 10 +5 =15 boxes, apple pie:15 boxes.

Wait, so on Saturday, apple pie sold was 4 fewer than on Sunday, which was 15 boxes. So, on Saturday, apple pie sold was 15 -4 =11 boxes.

But the problem doesn't specify how many apple pies were sold on Saturday, only that on Sunday he sold 15 boxes. So, perhaps I can figure out the number of apple pies sold on Saturday from the information given.

Wait, let me rephrase:

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer than Sunday

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 5 more than Saturday, so 10 +5 =15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Therefore, on Sunday, apple pie sold was 15 boxes, so on Saturday, apple pie sold was 15 -4 =11 boxes.

So, Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread, 11 boxes of apple pie.

Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread, 15 boxes of apple pie.

So, now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the cost per box to find the total earnings.

Wait, but the problem is asking for how much Sunny earned for two days, so we need to calculate the total revenue from both days.

Given that each gingerbread box costs $6 and each apple pie costs $15.

So, let's compute the earnings for each day.

First, Saturday:

Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 per box = 10*6 = $60

Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 per box = 11*15 = $165

So, total earnings on Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

Then, Sunday:

Gingerbread:15 boxes * $6 per box =15*6 = $90

Apple pie:15 boxes * $15 per box =15*15 = $75

Total earnings on Sunday: $90 + $75 = $165

Therefore, total earnings over the two days: $225 + $165 = $390

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

On Saturday:

10 boxes of gingerbread: 10*6=60

11 boxes of apple pie:11*15=165

Total Saturday:66+165=231? Wait, 10*6=60, 11*15=165? Wait, 11*15 is 165, yes. 60+165=225. Okay, that's correct
