Q: Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Okay, so Debra is monitoring a beehive and she's trying to figure out how many bees come and go each day. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says she sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. So, that's straightforward—30 bees leaving. Then, in the next 6 hours, she sees half that many bees return. So, half of 30 is 15. So, 15 bees come back in the second 6 hours. 

Then, the problem says she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Hmm, okay. So, she saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours, so two times that would be 60 bees. So, in the next 6 hours, 60 bees come back. 

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I understand that correctly. It says, "she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours." So, the number of bees returning in the next 6 hours is two times the number that left in the first 6 hours. So, that would be 2 * 30 = 60. So, 60 bees come back in the next 6 hours. 

But then, the problem also says, "then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, that means any bee that left in the first 6 hours hasn't returned yet, so they come back in the next 6 hours. So, that's another 30 bees returning in the next 6 hours. 

Wait, so let me try to structure this. 

First 6 hours: 30 bees leave. So, 0 bees are in the hive at the end of the first 6 hours. 

Next 6 hours: 15 bees return. So, at the end of the second 6 hours, the number of bees in the hive is 15. 

Then, the next 6 hours: 60 bees return. So, at the end of the third 6 hours, the number of bees in the hive is 15 + 60 = 75. 

But wait, the problem says, "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, that means the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours haven't returned yet, so they come back in the next 6 hours. So, that's another 30 bees. 

So, at the end of the third 6 hours, the number of bees in the hive is 15 (from the second 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) + 30 (from the first 6 hours that haven't returned yet) = 108 bees. 

Wait, but the question is asking, "How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?" So, the last 6 hours would be the third 6 hours, right? Because the first 6 hours are the first, then the next 6, then the next 6. So, the last 6 hours are the third one. 

So, in the third 6 hours, 60 bees return. But wait, hold on. The problem says, "she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours." So, that's 60 bees. But then, "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, that's 30 bees. 

So, in the third 6 hours, 60 bees return, but 30 of them haven't returned yet, so they come back now. So, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 60. But wait, hold on. Let me make sure.

Wait, the problem says, "she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours." So, that's 2 * 30 = 60. So, 60 bees return in the next 6 hours. But then, "every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours." So, that's 30 bees. 

So, in the third 6 hours, 60 bees return, but 30 haven't returned yet, so they come back now. So, the number of bees returning in the last
