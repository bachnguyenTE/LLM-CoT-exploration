Q: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Carl, Sean, and Cal marbles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says:

"Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?"

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many marbles each person has and then add Carl's and Cal's marbles together.

Starting with Sean, the problem already tells me that Sean has 56 marbles. So, Sean = 56 marbles.

Next, it says Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Hmm, so if Sean has half as many as Cal, that means Cal has twice as many as Sean. Let me write that down.

If Sean = 56, then Cal = 2 * Sean.

So, Cal = 2 * 56. Let me calculate that. 2 times 56 is 112. So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, the problem also states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, if Sean has 56 marbles, then Carl has 4 times that. Let me write that.

Carl = 4 * Sean.

So, Carl = 4 * 56. Calculating that, 4 times 56 is 224. So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Now, the question is asking for the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have. So, I need to add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together.

Carl has 224 marbles, and Cal has 112 marbles. So, 224 + 112.

Let me add those. 224 plus 100 is 324, and then plus 12 is 336. So, 224 + 112 equals 336.

Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 224 + 112. Starting from the right, 4 + 2 is 6, 2 + 1 is 3, and 2 + 1 is 3. So, yes, 336. That seems right.

So, putting it all together:

- Sean has 56 marbles.
- Cal has twice as many as Sean, so 112 marbles.
- Carl has four times as many as Sean, so 224 marbles.
- Combined, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I interpreted the relationships correctly. The problem says:

"Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal."

So, is that two separate relationships? So, first, Sean has half as many as Cal, which we used to find Cal's marbles. Then, Carl has four times as many as Sean, which we used to find Carl's marbles. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I had misread it, maybe Sean has half as many as Cal, and Carl has four times as many as Sean, but that's the same as what I did. So, I think my calculations are correct.

Just to recap:

1. Sean = 56 marbles.
2. Cal = 2 * Sean = 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.
3. Carl = 4 * Sean = 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.
4. Carl + Cal = 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

So, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The relationships are straightforward, and the calculations seem correct. I don't see any hidden steps or misinterpretations of the problem.

**Final Answer**
The combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is \boxed{336}.
</think>

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we need to determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean:
   \[
   \text{Cal} = 2 \times \text{Sean} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]
3. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:
   \[
   \text{Carl} = 4 \times \text{Sean} = 4 \times 56 = 224
