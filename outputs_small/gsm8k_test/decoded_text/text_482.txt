Q: Keegan was running a car wash with his friend Tashay to raise money for a baseball camp. They needed to raise $200 for the two of them. By 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. How much more did they need to earn to reach their goal?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of money Keegan and Tasha have earned together by 3 pm.

Keegan earned $83, and Tasha earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives a total of $174.

Next, I'll calculate how much more money they need to reach their goal of $200. I'll subtract the total amount they've already earned from the goal: $200 minus $174 equals $26.

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

To determine how much more money Keegan and Tasha need to reach their goal of \$200, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount earned by 3 pm:**
   \[
   \$83 \ (\text{Keegan}) + \$91 \ (\text{Tasha}) = \$174
   \]

2. **Determine the additional amount needed to reach \$200:**
   \[
   \$200 \ (\text{goal}) - \$174 \ (\text{earned}) = \$26
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
