Q: Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?

Okay, so I have this problem about Pamela and her sunscreen. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Pamela reaps an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. While on vacation, she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days. The question is, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?

Alright, so let's break this down. First, I need to find out how much sunscreen Pamela uses in total during her vacation. Then, since each bottle is 8 ounces, I can figure out how many bottles she needs by dividing the total ounces by 8. If there's any remainder, she'll need an extra bottle.

Let me start by calculating the total number of hours she's outside. She's outside 4 hours each day for 8 days. So, that's 4 hours/day multiplied by 8 days. Let me write that out:

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Okay, so she's outside for 32 hours. Now, she uses an ounce of sunscreen every hour. So, the total amount of sunscreen she'll use is 1 ounce/hour * 32 hours. Let me calculate that:

Total sunscreen = 1 ounce/hour * 32 hours = 32 ounces.

Alright, so she needs 32 ounces of sunscreen. Now, each bottle is 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, I can divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:

Number of bottles = 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, she needs 4 bottles. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, total hours: 4 hours a day for 8 days. 4*8 is indeed 32. Then, 32 hours multiplied by 1 ounce per hour is 32 ounces. Divided by 8 ounces per bottle is 4 bottles. Hmm, that seems correct.

But hold on, sometimes when packing, you might need to round up if there's a partial bottle needed. But in this case, 32 ounces divided by 8 ounces is exactly 4, so no rounding up is necessary. So, 4 bottles is the exact number.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating how much she uses each day and then over 8 days. Let's try that.

She's outside 4 hours a day, so each day she uses 1 ounce/hour * 4 hours = 4 ounces per day. Then, over 8 days, that's 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces. Again, same result. So, 32 ounces divided by 8 ounces per bottle is 4 bottles. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many bottles she uses each day. Since each bottle is 8 ounces, and she uses 4 ounces a day, that's 4 ounces / 8 ounces per bottle = 0.5 bottles per day. So, over 8 days, that's 0.5 bottles/day * 8 days = 4 bottles. So, same answer again.

So, regardless of the method I use, I get 4 bottles. So, I think that's the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me visualize it. If she uses 1 ounce every hour, and she's outside 4 hours a day, that's 4 ounces a day. So, each day, she uses half a bottle. Over 8 days, that's 4 bottles. So, yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think about how many bottles she uses each day, it's 4 ounces, so 0.5 bottles. So, 0.5 bottles per day times 8 days is 4 bottles. So, same result.

Wait, another way: 8 days, 4 hours each day, so 32 hours. 32 ounces. Each bottle is 8 ounces, so 32 divided by 8 is 4. So, 4 bottles. So, same answer.

I think I've verified it enough ways. So, I can be confident that the answer is 4 bottles.

**Final Answer**
Pamela will need to pack \boxed{4} bottles of sunscreen.

Pamela reaps an ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. She is outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days. Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces.

First, calculate the total number of hours she is outside:
\[
4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \
