Q: James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?

Okay, so James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His fence is a rectangle, and the long side is 20 feet, while the short side is 15 feet. Hmm, I need to figure out how much crepe paper he needs to buy. 

First, I should visualize the fence. It's a rectangle, so it has two long sides and two short sides. The long sides are 20 feet each, and the short sides are 15 feet each. Now, crepe-paper streamers are usually used to hang decorations, so I think James is going to hang them from the posts or maybe from the corners of the fence. 

Wait, the question says he wants to hang them from his backyard fence. So, maybe he's going to hang them from the posts? If that's the case, then each streamer would be attached to a post, and he needs to know the length of each streamer. But the problem doesn't specify how many streamers he's hanging. Hmm, maybe I need to assume he's hanging one streamer from each post? Or perhaps he's using the entire length of the fence as the length of the streamers?

Wait, let me read the question again: "How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?" It doesn't specify the number of streamers, so maybe it's just one streamer? Or perhaps he's using the entire perimeter? Hmm, that's a bit unclear.

Wait, maybe I should think about the standard way to hang streamers from a fence. Usually, you can hang streamers from the posts or from the rails. If it's from the posts, then each streamer would be the length of the side of the fence. So, if he's hanging one streamer from each post, he would need two streamers, one for each long side and one for each short side. But the question is asking how many feet of crepe paper he needs to buy. So, if he's using one streamer, maybe he needs one length of the fence.

Wait, but the fence is a rectangle, so it's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. If he's hanging streamers from the posts, then each streamer would be the length of the side. So, for the long sides, each streamer would be 20 feet, and for the short sides, each streamer would be 15 feet. But again, the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. It says, "how many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?" So, perhaps he's just going to hang one streamer from the fence, and he needs to know the length of that streamer. But without knowing where he's hanging it, it's hard to say. Maybe he's hanging it from the top of the fence, so the length would be the diagonal of the rectangle?

Wait, that might make sense. If he's hanging the streamer diagonally across the fence, then the length of the streamer would be the diagonal of the rectangle. So, to find the diagonal, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is: 

diagonal = sqrt(length^2 + width^2)

So, plugging in the numbers:

length = 20 feet
width = 15 feet

So, diagonal = sqrt(20^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(400 + 225) = sqrt(625) = 25 feet

So, if he's hanging the streamer diagonally across the fence, he would need 25 feet of crepe paper. That seems reasonable.

But wait, is that the case? If he's hanging it from the top, maybe it's just the length of the fence, either 20 or 15 feet. But the question doesn't specify where he's hanging it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe he's using the entire perimeter of the fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). So, that would be 2*(20 + 15) = 2*(37) = 74 feet. But that seems like a lot, and I don't know if that's what he needs.

Wait, but the question is about crepe-paper streamers, which are usually used to hang decorations from the posts. So, if he's hanging them from the posts, then he would need one streamer for each post. But since it's a rectangle, there are four posts. So, he would need four streamers, each 20 feet or 15 feet long. But again, the question is asking how many feet of crepe paper he needs to buy, not how many streamers.

Wait, maybe it's just one streamer, and he's using the entire length of
