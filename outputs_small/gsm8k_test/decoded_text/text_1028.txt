Q: Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.  He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set.  He then has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set.  How much does he have to pay per month?

Okay, so Tom bought a bedroom set for $3000. Hmm, that's a bit expensive, but I guess it's a new one. Then he sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. Alright, so he's using the $1000 to cover some of the cost. That means he doesn't have to pay the full $3000 for the bedroom set anymore. 

Let me think about how much he still needs to pay. The total cost was $3000, and he sold his old bedroom for $1000. So, I should subtract the $1000 from the total to find out how much he still owes. Let me write that down: $3000 minus $1000 equals... hmm, 3000 minus 1000 is 2000. So, Tom still needs to pay $2000 for the bedroom set. 

Now, he has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. Wait, 10% a month? That seems a bit high, but maybe it's a monthly fee. So, he's going to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. I need to calculate 10% of $2000. 

To find 10% of a number, I can multiply that number by 0.10. So, 2000 times 0.10. Let me do that: 2000 * 0.10 is 200. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. 

Wait, that seems like a lot. If he's paying $200 each month, that's a pretty high monthly fee. Is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations. 

Total cost: $3000. He sold $1000, so remaining amount is $3000 - $1000 = $2000. Then, 10% of $2000 is 0.10 * 2000 = 200. So, yes, that's correct. 

So, Tom has to pay $200 each month for the bedroom set. 

Wait, but the question is asking how much he has to pay per month. So, is that the final answer? It seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. 

He bought it for $3000, sold it for $1000, so he's left with $2000. Then, he has to pay 10% of that each month. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. So, yeah, he has to pay $200 each month. 

I think that's it. So, the answer is $200 per month. 

**Final Answer**
Tom has to pay \boxed{200} dollars per month.

Tom bought a bedroom set for $3000. He sold his old bedroom for $1000 and used that to pay for part of the bedroom set. 

First, we calculate the remaining amount he needs to pay:
\[
3000 - 1000 = 2000
\]

Next, we need to find 10% of the remaining $2000:
\[
0.10 \times 2000 = 200
\]

Therefore, Tom has to pay \boxed{200} dollars per month.
