Q: There are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel. It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room. How many hours would it take to clean one-half of the rooms?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a hotel with 90 rooms, and each room takes 20 minutes to clean. The question is asking how many hours it would take to clean half of those rooms. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how many rooms half of 90 is. Since there are 90 rooms in total, half of that would be 90 rooms, right? Because 90 divided by 2 is 45, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 90 divided by 2 is actually 45? No, wait, 90 divided by 2 is 45? Wait, no, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, hold on, 90 divided by 2 is 45? No, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45? Wait, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45? Wait, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45? Wait, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45? Wait, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, no, 2 times 45 is 90, so half of 90 is 45. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45.5? Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45. So, 90 divided by 2 is 45. So, half of 90 is 45. So, 45 rooms.

Wait, no, 90 divided by 2 is 45. So, half of 90 is 45. So, 45 rooms. So, the number of rooms to clean is 45.

Now, each room takes 20 minutes to clean. So, to find the total time, I need to multiply the number of rooms by the time per room. So, 45 rooms times 20 minutes per room.

Let me calculate that. 45 times 20. Hmm, 45 times 20 is 900 minutes. So, 900 minutes in total.

But the question is asking for how many hours it would take. So, I need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I divide the total minutes by 60.

So, 900 divided by 60. Let me compute that. 60 times 15 is 900, right? Because 60 times 10 is 660, and 66 times 5 is 330, so 660 plus 330 is 990? Wait, no, 60 times 15 is 900. So, 900 divided by 60 is 15. So, 15 hours.

Wait, so 45 rooms times 20 minutes is 900 minutes, which is 15 hours. So, the answer is 15 hours.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes in multiplication or division.

So, 45 rooms times 20 minutes: 45 times 20. 45 times 20 is 900 minutes. 900 divided by 60 is 15. So, 15 hours. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 20 minutes per
