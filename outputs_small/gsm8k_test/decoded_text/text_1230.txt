Q: Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Charlie will make today. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

Charlie is a tennis pro who teaches others. His standard fee is $80 per hour, but when he's teaching to veterans, he reduces his rate by 25%. Today, he has 4 one-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran. I need to calculate the total amount he will make.

First, let me figure out Charlie's reduced rate when he's teaching to veterans. His standard fee is $80 per hour, and he reduces that by 25%. Hmm, so I need to calculate 25% of $80 and then subtract that from $80 to get the reduced rate.

Calculating 25% of $80: 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal form. So, 0.25 multiplied by 80. Let me do that multiplication.

0.25 * 80. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of 80 is 20. So, 25% of 80 is 20. Therefore, Charlie's reduced rate is $80 minus $20, which is $68 per hour when teaching to veterans.

Alright, so now I know his rates: standard is $80, and with a veteran, it's $68 per hour.

Now, let's figure out how much he makes today. He has 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate and 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran.

So, for the standard lessons: 4 hours * $80 per hour. Let me calculate that.

4 * 80. 4 times 80 is 320. So, he makes $320 from the standard lessons.

Then, for the veteran lessons: 2 hours * $68 per hour. Let me compute that.

2 * 68. 2 times 60 is 120, and 2 times 8 is 16, so 120 + 16 is 136. So, he makes $136 from the veteran lessons.

Now, to find the total amount he makes today, I need to add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons together.

So, $320 + $136. Let me add those. 320 + 136. 300 + 100 is 400, 20 + 36 is 56, so 400 + 56 is 456. So, total is $456.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 25% of 80: 0.25 * 80 is indeed 20, so 80 - 20 is 60. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 - 20 is 60, not 68. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, hold on, 25% of 80 is 20, so 80 - 20 is 60. So, the reduced rate is $60, not $68. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate 25% of 80. 25% is a quarter, so a quarter of 80 is 20, right? So, 80 - 20 is 60. Wait, no, 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 80 is 20, so 80 - 20 is 60. Wait, 20 is 20, so 80 - 20 is 60. So, the reduced rate is $60, not $68.

Wait, so I think I messed up the calculation earlier. 25% of 80 is 20, not 20. Wait, 0.25 * 80 is 20, so 80 - 20 is 60. Wait, no, 80 - 20 is 60. Wait, 80 - 20 is 60. So, the reduced rate is $60 per hour.

Wait, so that changes things. So, let me recast the problem with the correct reduced rate.

So, standard rate is $80, reduced rate is $
