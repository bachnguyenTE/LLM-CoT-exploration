Q: Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train. If 80 more people descended at the third station, calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

Okay, so I have this problem about Romeo boarding a train, and I need to figure out the total number of people on the train after three stops. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Romeo boards a train with 120 people. So, initially, the train has 120 people on it. That seems straightforward.

Now, at the first stop, 20 more people board the train. Hmm, okay, so I need to add those 20 to the current number of passengers. So, starting from 120, adding 20. Let me write that down:

120 (initial number) + 20 (boarding at first stop) = ?

Wait, 120 plus 20. Hmm, 120 plus 20 is 142. So, after the first stop, there are 142 people on the train.

Alright, moving on to the second stop. It says that at the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train. Hmm, okay, so let me parse that.

So, 50 people descended. That means 50 people got off. But it also says twice that number boarded the train. So, twice 50 is 100. So, 100 people boarded the train at the second stop.

Wait, so at the second stop, 100 people boarded, and 50 people got off. So, the net change at the second stop is +100 - 50 = +50.

So, starting from 142 after the first stop, adding 50 at the second stop. Let me calculate that:

142 + 50 = ?

142 plus 50. 142 + 50 is 192. So, after the second stop, there are 192 people on the train.

Now, moving on to the third stop. It says that 80 more people descended at the third station. So, that means 80 people got off. But wait, is that the only change? Or is there a boarding as well?

Wait, the problem says "twice that number boarded the train." So, similar to the second stop, twice the number that descended. So, if 50 people descended, twice that is 100, so 100 boarded.

But at the third stop, it's just 80 people who descended, not twice that number. So, maybe only 80 people got off, and no one boarded? Or is it that 80 people got off, and twice that number boarded, which would be 160.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train." So, at the second stop, 50 people got off, and 100 boarded. So, net change is +50.

Similarly, at the third stop, it says "80 more people descended at the third station." So, 80 people got off. It doesn't mention anything about boarding, so maybe only 80 people got off, and no one boarded. So, the net change is -80.

So, starting from 192 after the second stop, subtracting 80 at the third stop.

192 - 80 = ?

192 minus 80. 192 minus 80 is 112. So, after the third stop, there are 112 people on the train.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, initial: 120.

First stop: +20, so 142.

Second stop: 100 boarded, 50 got off. So, net change is +50, so 142 +55=197? Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did earlier.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the problem says at the second stop, 50 people descended while twice that number boarded. So, 50 got off, 100 boarded. So, net change is +50.

So, 142 +55=197.

Wait, but earlier I thought 142 +50=192, but that was incorrect. It should be 142 +55=197.

Wait, so that's a mistake in my earlier calculation.

So, let me correct that.

After first stop: 142.

Second stop: 142 +55=197.

Third stop: 80 more people descended. So, 1
