Q: If two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two trains departing from a station in opposite directions. One train is going at 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which would be 30 miles per hour. The question is asking how far apart they are after 3 hours. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, if one train is going 60 mph and the other is going 30 mph, their combined speed is 60 + 30, which is 90 mph. That makes sense because they're moving away from each other, so their speeds add up.

Now, the time they've been traveling is 3 hours. To find the distance between them, I can use the formula: distance = speed × time. So, plugging in the numbers, it should be 90 mph multiplied by 3 hours. Let me do that calculation: 90 × 3. Hmm, 90 times 3 is 270. So, is the answer 270 miles?

Wait, let me double-check. The first train is going 60 mph, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 60 × 3 = 180 miles. The second train is going 30 mph, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 × 3 = 90 miles. Since they're moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them should be the sum of these two distances, which is 180 + 90 = 270 miles. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier.

I think that makes sense. So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's straightforward because when two objects move away from each other, their separation increases by the sum of their speeds over time.

Just to make sure, let me visualize it. Imagine the station is at a point, and one train is going east at 60 mph, while the other is going west at 30 mph. After 3 hours, the eastbound train would be 180 miles east, and the westbound train would be 90 miles west. The total distance between them is 180 + 90, which is 270 miles. Yep, that's correct.

I don't think I made any errors here. The key was recognizing that their speeds add up because they're moving in opposite directions. If they were moving towards each other, their relative speed would be the difference, but since they're going away, it's the sum. So, 60 + 30 = 90 mph, and over 3 hours, that's 270 miles apart.

I guess another way to think about it is that each hour, the distance between them increases by 60 + 30 = 90 miles. So, after 1 hour, it's 90 miles apart, after 2 hours, 180 miles, and after 3 hours, 270 miles. That also checks out.

So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 270 miles. I don't see any other factors or tricks in the problem that I might have missed. It's a straightforward relative speed problem with constant speeds and equal time.

**Final Answer**
The two trains are \boxed{270} miles apart after 3 hours.

The problem involves two trains departing from a station in opposite directions. One train travels at 60 miles per hour, and the other at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. We need to determine how far apart they are after 3 hours.

First, we calculate the combined speed of the two trains since they are moving in opposite directions:
\[
60 \text{ mph} + 30 \text{ mph} = 90 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
\text{Distance} = 90 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 270 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is:
\[
\boxed{270}
\]
