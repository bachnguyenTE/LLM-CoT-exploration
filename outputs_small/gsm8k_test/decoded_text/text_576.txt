Q: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Michael needs to replace the carpet in his bedroom, and I need to figure out how much it will cost him. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet. That means the area of the bedroom is length multiplied by width. So, 18 feet times 12 feet. Let me calculate that. 18 times 12 is... 216 square feet. Okay, so the area is 216 square feet.

Now, the carpet and padding cost $12 per square foot, plus an extra $2 per square foot for padding. So, that's a total of $14 per square foot. Let me write that down: $14 per sq ft.

Next, the contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. So, that's a removal fee. Then, after removing the old carpet, they charge $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. So, that's an installation fee.

Wait, so the total cost per square foot would be the removal fee plus the installation fee. So, $4 plus $34 is $38 per square foot. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but okay, let's go with it.

So, Michael is replacing the carpet, so he needs to remove the old carpet and then install the new one. So, the total cost per square foot is $38. Therefore, the total cost for the entire bedroom would be 216 square feet multiplied by $38 per square foot.

Let me compute that. 216 times 38. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Let me break it down. 200 times 38 is... 200 times 30 is 6,000, and 200 times 8 is 1,600, so 6,000 plus 1,600 is 7,600. Then, 16 times 38 is... 10 times 38 is 380, and 6 times 38 is 228, so 380 plus 228 is 608. So, adding those together, 7,600 plus 608 is 8,208. So, the total cost is $8,208.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication because 216 times 38. Maybe I should do it another way. 216 times 38. Let's do 216 times 30, which is 6,480, and 216 times 8, which is 1,728. Then, adding 6,480 and 1,728 together. 6,480 plus 1,728: 6,000 plus 1,000 is 7,000, 480 plus 728 is 1,208. So, 7,000 plus 1,208 is 8,208. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Michael will spend $8,208 in total to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. The problem says the new carpet costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding. So, that's $14 per square foot. Then, the contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. So, that's $4 plus $34, which is $38 per square foot. So, 216 times 38 is indeed $8,208.

Is there any other cost? The problem doesn't mention any other fees or taxes, so I think that's it.

So, to recap: Area is 216 sq ft. Cost per sq ft is $14, so 216 times 14 is 3,024. Then, the contractor's removal and installation is 216 times 38, which is 8,208. So, total cost is 3,024 plus 8,208, which is 11,232. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, no, because the $14 per sq ft is the total cost per sq ft, which includes both the carpet and padding. So, the total cost is 216 times 14, which is 3,024, plus 216 times 38, which is
