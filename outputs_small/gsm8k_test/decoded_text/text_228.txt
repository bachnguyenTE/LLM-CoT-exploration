Okay, so Kalinda is working on a 360-piece puzzle with her mom. I need to figure out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle together. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many pieces each of them can add per minute. The problem says Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. That's straightforward. Now, her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. So, if Kalinda does 4 pieces per minute, her mom must do half of that. Let me calculate that: half of 4 is 2. So, Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, and her mom adds 2 pieces per minute.

Now, I need to find out how many pieces they can add together each minute. That should be the sum of Kalinda's rate and her mom's rate. So, 4 pieces per minute plus 2 pieces per minute equals 6 pieces per minute together. Okay, so together, they can add 6 pieces each minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. So, to find out how long it will take them to complete the puzzle, I need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add together each minute. That would be 360 divided by 6. Let me do that division: 360 divided by 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 36 six times, so 6 times 60 is 360. So, 360 divided by 6 is 60. So, it will take them 60 minutes to complete the puzzle together.

But wait, the question asks for how many hours it will take. So, I need to convert 60 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, right? So, 60 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour is 1 hour. Wait, no, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour and 0 minutes. Wait, that can't be right because 60 minutes is exactly 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 60 minutes is 1 hour. So, 6
