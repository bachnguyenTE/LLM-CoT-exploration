Q: Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

Okay, so I have this problem about Juan and his brother Carlos selling lemonade. I need to figure out how much they spent on lemons if their total profit was $25. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the costs involved. For each gallon of lemonade, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Got that.

Next, they sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon would be 20 * $0.50. Let me calculate that: 20 * 0.50 is... 10? Wait, 20 glasses times $0.50 each. Hmm, 20 * 0.50. Let me do this properly. 20 * 0.50 is the same as 20 * 50 cents, which is 1000 cents. So, 100 cents is $1.00. So, they make $1.00 per gallon from selling lemonade. Okay, so revenue per gallon is $1.00.

Now, their total cost per gallon is $5.00, and their revenue per gallon is $1.00. So, the profit per gallon would be revenue minus cost, which is $1.00 - $5.00. Wait, that can't be right. $1.00 minus $5.00 would be a loss, but the problem says they made a profit of $25. Hmm, maybe I messed up the numbers.

Wait, let me double-check. They make 20 glasses per gallon. Each glass is $0.50, so 20 * 0.50. Let me compute that again. 20 * 0.50 is 10.00, and 1 * 0.50 is 0.50, so total is 10.50. So, they make $10.50 per gallon. Okay, that makes more sense. So, revenue per gallon is $10.50.

Total cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so $5.000. So, profit per gallon is revenue minus cost, which is 10.500 - 5.00 = $5.50 per gallon. Okay, that makes sense. So, each gallon gives them a $5.50 profit.

Now, they made a total profit of $25. So, to find out how many gallons they sold, I can divide the total profit by the profit per gallon. So, 25 divided by 5.50. Let me compute that. 25 / 5.50. Hmm, 5.50 goes into 25 how many times? 5.50 * 4 = 22.00, which is less than 25. 5.50 * 4.545... Wait, maybe I should do it as a fraction.

25 divided by 5.50 is the same as 2500 divided by 550, which simplifies. Let me see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10, so 250 / 55. Then, both can be divided by 5: 50 / 11. So, 50 divided by 11 is 50, but 50 divided by 11 is 50. Wait, no, 50 divided by 11 is 50/11, which is 50. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 25 / 5.5 is equal to 250 / 55, which is 50 / 11, which is 50. Wait, no, 25 / 5.5 is 250 / 55, which is 50. So, 25 / 5.5 is 4.5454... So, approximately 4.5454 gallons.

But wait, they can't sell a fraction of a gallon, right? Or can they? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's okay. But let me see if I can represent it as a fraction. 25 / 5.5 is equal to 50 / 11, which is 50/11, which is 50. Wait, no, 25 / 5.5 is 250 / 55, which is 50
