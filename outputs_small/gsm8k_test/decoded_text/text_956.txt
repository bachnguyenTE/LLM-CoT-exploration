A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Robyn sending emails, and I need to figure out how many she sends to her boyfriend. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. How many emails a day does she send to her boyfriend?"

Alright, so Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. Then, the rest are divided between family and her boyfriend. Specifically, two-thirds of the remainder are to family, and one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, I need to find out how many emails go to her boyfriend.

Let me break this down step by step. First, total emails: 16. Work emails: 7. Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 7 is more than 6. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check again. It says Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. Hmm, so maybe the total is 16, and seven of them are work emails. So the remainder would be 16 - 7 = 9 emails. Then, two-thirds of the remainder are to family, so that's (2/3)*9 = 6 emails to family. Then, the remaining emails are one-third to her boyfriend. So, 9 - 6 = 3 emails to boyfriend. So, 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. It says, "Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family." So, the remainder is the emails that are not work emails. So, 16 total, 7 are work, so remainder is 9. Then, two-thirds of 9 are to family, which is 6, and the rest, which is 3, are to her boyfriend. So, 3 emails to boyfriend.

But let me think again. Is the remainder after work emails, so 16 -7=9. Then, two-thirds of that remainder are to family, so 6, and the other one-third are to boyfriend, so 3. So, 3 is the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure that the problem is not saying that the remainder is split into two parts: two-thirds to family and one-third to boyfriend. So, if the remainder is 9, then two-thirds is 6, one-third is 3. So, 3 is the number of emails to boyfriend.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the remainder is split into two parts: two-thirds to family and one-third to boyfriend. So, 9 emails, two-thirds to family, one-third to boyfriend. So, 6 to family, 3 to boyfriend.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that after the work emails, the remainder is split into two parts: two-thirds to family and one-third to boyfriend. So, 9 emails, two-thirds to family, one-third to boyfriend. So, 6 to family, 3 to boyfriend.

So, 3 is the answer. So, the number of emails to boyfriend is 3.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the total number of emails 16? So, 7 work emails, 6 to family, 3 to boyfriend. 7+6+3=16. Yes, that adds up. So, 3 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. How many emails a day does she send to her boyfriend?"

So, total emails:16. Seven are work emails. So, the remainder is 16-7=9. Then, two-thirds of the remainder are to family, so 2/3*9=6. Then, the remaining emails are one-third to boyfriend, so 1/3*9=3. So, 3 is the number of emails to boyfriend.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that after the work emails, the remainder is split into two parts: two-thirds to family and one-third to boyfriend. So, 9 emails, two-thirds to family, one-third to boyfriend. So, 6 to family, 3 to boyfriend.

So, 3 is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the remainder is split into two parts: two-thirds to family and one-third to boyfriend. So,
