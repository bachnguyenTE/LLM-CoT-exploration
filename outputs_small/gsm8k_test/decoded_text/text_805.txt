Okay, so James buys a ring for his bride-to-be, and he spent some money on it. The diamond part of the ring costs $600, and the gold part costs $300. Then, he also pays a 30% premium. Hmm, I need to figure out how much he paid in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium. That would be the cost of the diamond plus the cost of the gold. So, the diamond is $600 and the gold is $300. Let me add those together.

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $930.

Okay, so the base cost of the ring is $930. Now, he has to pay a 30% premium on this amount. I need to calculate 30% of $930 and then add that to the base cost to get the total amount he paid.

To find 30% of $930, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 30% is the same as 0.30. Then, I multiply $930 by 0.30.

Let me do that multiplication. 930 multiplied by 0.30. Hmm, 930 times 0.3 is... let me calculate that. 930 times 0.3 is 279. So, 930 * 0.3 = 279. Therefore, the premium is $279.

Now, to find the total amount James paid, I add the base cost and the premium together. So, $930 + $279.

Let me add those. 930 + 279. 900 + 200 is 1100, and 30 + 79 is 109. So, 1100 + 109 is 1209. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.

Wait, 930 + 279. Let's add the units place: 0 + 9 is 9. The tens place: 3 + 7 is 10, so carry over 1. The hundreds place: 9 + 2 is 11, plus the carried over 1 is 12. So, the total is $12109? Wait, that can't be right because 930 + 279 is 1209. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total amount James paid is $1209.

Wait, hold on, let me verify that again because I might have made a mistake in adding. 930 + 279. Let's break it down:

930 + 200 = 1130

1130 + 79 = 1209

Yes, that's correct. So, the total is $1209.

But wait, let me double-check the percentage calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake there. So, 30% of 930 is 0.3 * 930. Let me compute that again.

0.3 * 900 is 270, and 0.3 * 30 is 9. So, 270 + 9 is 279. So, that's correct. So, the premium is indeed $279.

Adding that to the base cost: 930 + 279. Let me do this another way. 930 + 279. Let's add 930 + 200 first, which is 1130, then add 79 more. 1130 + 79 is 1209. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $1209.

Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says the diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. Did I add those correctly? Let me check.

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold). Wait, is that $600 or $600? Wait, the user wrote $600 and $300. Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as $600 and $300. Wait, no, the user wrote:

"the diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300."

Wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it's written as $600 and $300.
