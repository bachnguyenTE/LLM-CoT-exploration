Q: Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, his age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me note down the information given. Liam is currently 16 years old. That's straightforward. Now, two years ago, his age was twice Vince's age. So, I need to find out Vince's current age.

Let me denote Vince's current age as V. That seems like a good start. So, if I can find V, that will answer the question.

Now, two years ago, Liam's age would have been 16 - 2, which is 14. So, two years ago, Liam was 14 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, that means 14 = 2 * V. Hmm, okay, so I can set up that equation.

So, 14 equals twice Vince's age. To find V, I can divide both sides of the equation by 2. Let me write that down:

14 = 2 * V

Divide both sides by 2:

14 / 2 = V

So, 7 = V

Therefore, Vince is currently 7 years old.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Vince is 7 now, then two years ago he was 5. And Liam was 14 two years ago, which is indeed twice 5. That makes sense.

So, yeah, that seems correct. So, Vince is 7 years old now.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again.

Liam is 16 now. Two years ago, he was 14. That's correct because 16 - 2 = 14.

Vince's age two years ago was half of that, so 14 / 2 = 7. So, Vince was 7 two years ago, which means he is now 7 + 2 = 9. Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my previous answer.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me see.

Wait, no, wait. If two years ago, Vince was 7, then his current age is 7 + 2 = 9. But earlier, I thought it was 7. So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me clarify. If two years ago, Vince was 7, then his current age is 7 + 2 = 9. But in my first calculation, I thought that two years ago, his age was 5, which is half of 10, but that's not correct.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, two years ago, Liam was 14, so 14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago. So, that means Vince's age two years ago was 7. So, that would make Vince's current age 7 + 2 = 9.

But wait, that contradicts my initial answer. So, which one is correct?

Wait, let me check the problem again. It says, "Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince." So, that means two years ago, L = 2 * V. So, L was 14, so 14 = 2 * V, so V was 7. So, that would mean that two years ago, Vince was 7, so now he is 9.

But wait, that seems conflicting with my initial thought. So, why did I think it was 7?

Wait, maybe I confused the current age with the age two years ago. Let me make a table to clarify.

Let me denote:

Current age of Liam: 16

Two years ago, Liam's age: 16 - 2 = 14

Two years ago, Vince's age: Let's denote as V - 2

Given that 14 = 2 * (V - 2)

So, 14 = 2V - 4

Then, adding 4 to both sides: 14 + 4 = 2V

18 = 2V

Divide both sides by 2: V = 4

Wait, hold on, that's different. So, now I'm getting V = 4.

Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, let me go through this step by step.

Let me define V as Vince's current age.

Two years ago, his age was V - 2.

Given that two years ago, L = 2 * (V - 2)

So,
