Q: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Okay, so I have this problem about Wendi and her chickens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that every day, Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed. These feeds include seeds, mealworms, and vegetables. She gives them their feed in three separate meals throughout the day. 

Now, the question is asking how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. It also mentions that in the morning, she gives them 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. So, we need to find out how much she needs for the final meal.

Let me break this down. 

First, let's figure out the total amount of feed Wendi uses each day. She has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed. So, the total feed per day is 20 multiplied by 3 cups. 

Wait, hold on, 20? Is that 20? Because 20 multiplied by 3 is 60 cups. So, 60 cups of feed in total each day. 

But she gives this feed in three separate meals throughout the day. So, each meal would be 60 cups divided by 3 meals. That would be 20 cups per meal. 

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total feed given in the morning and afternoon and then subtract that from the total daily feed to find out how much is left for the final meal. 

So, in the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. So, total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. 

Since the total daily feed is 60 cups, subtracting the 40 cups already given would leave 60 - 40 = 20 cups for the final meal. 

Hmm, that seems to match the earlier calculation. So, both methods give me 20 cups. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. 

She has 20 chickens, each getting 3 cups. So, 20 * 3 = 60 cups. Divided by 3 meals, that's 20 cups per meal. So, that's consistent. 

Alternatively, if I think about the total feed given in the morning and afternoon, 15 + 25 = 40 cups, so 60 - 40 = 20 cups left. 

So, both methods lead me to 20 cups. 

Therefore, the answer should be 20 cups. 

But just to make sure, let me think about the units. The problem says cups, chickens, and the feeds. So, the units are consistent. 

Also, the problem mentions that the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens, so that's the number we need to use. 

So, yeah, I think 20 cups is the correct answer. 

**Final Answer**
The number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is \boxed{20}.

Wendi feeds her 20 chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed each day. The total feed required each day is calculated as follows:

\[
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

This total feed is divided into three separate meals, so each meal requires:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ meals}} = 20 \text{ cups per meal}
\]

Additionally, Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Subtracting this from the total daily feed gives the amount needed for the final meal:

\[
60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is \boxed{20}.
