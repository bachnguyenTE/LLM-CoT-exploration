Q: John decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so John is buying new phones for himself, his two kids, and his wife. That makes a total of four people, right? Each phone after the first two is half price. The phone is priced at $600. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many phones John is buying. He's buying for himself, two kids, and his wife. So that's 1 (himself) + 2 (kids) + 1 (wife) = 4 phones in total. Got that.

Now, the pricing: the first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. Then, each phone after the first two is half price. So, the third and fourth phones will be half of $600 each. Let me calculate that.

Half of $600 is... let me see, 600 divided by 2 is 300. So, each of the third and fourth phones costs $300.

Now, let me figure out the total cost. The first two phones are full price, so that's 2 times $600. Let me compute that: 2 * 600 = 1200. Wait, hold on, 2 times 600 is 1260? Hmm, no, that can't be right. Wait, 600 * 2 is 1200. Yeah, that's correct.

Then, the third and fourth phones are half price, so that's 2 phones at $300 each. So, 2 * 300 = 600.

Now, adding those two amounts together: 1260 + 600. Let me add that up. 1260 + 600. 1200 + 600 is 1800, and then add the remaining 60, so 1800 + 60 is 1860. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it properly.

1260 + 600. Let's add the units place: 0 + 0 = 0. Tens place: 6 + 0 = 6. Hundreds place: 2 + 6 = 8. Thousands place: 1 + 0 = 1. So, that's 1860. Wait, that seems off because 1260 + 600 is 1860. Hmm, but 1260 + 600 is 1860? Wait, 1260 + 600: 1000 + 200 is 1200, 600 + 600 is 1200, so 1200 + 1200 is 2400? Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the addition. Let me write it down:

 1260
+600
------
 1860

Yes, that's correct. 1260 + 600 is 1860. So, the total cost is $1860.

Wait, but let me double-check. First phone: $600, second phone: $600, third phone: $300, fourth phone: $300. So, 600 + 600 is 1200, plus 300 is 1500, plus 300 is 1800. Wait, that's different. Wait, hold on, 600 + 600 is 1260, then 300 + 300 is 600, so 1260 + 600 is 1926? Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, no, I think I'm messing up the addition. Let me do it again.

First phone: 600

Second phone: 600

Third phone: 300

Fourth phone: 300

So, adding them up: 600 + 600 is 1260, then 300 + 300 is 600, so 1260 + 600 is 1926. Wait, that's different from before. So, which is correct?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 600 + 600 is 1260, and 300 + 300 is 600, so 12
