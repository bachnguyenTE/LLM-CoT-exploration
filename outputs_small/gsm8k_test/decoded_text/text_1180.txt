Okay, so I have this problem here where a company sold 4000 gallons of milk to Mr. Marcellus' store. Each gallon was sold at $3.5. But then, later, Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk he bought had expired and couldn't be sold. He returned it to the company and got a refund. I need to figure out how much he got in refunds.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, the company sold 4000 gallons of milk. Each gallon was sold at $3.5. So, the total amount they made from selling all the milk would be 4000 multiplied by 3.5. But wait, actually, the company sold 4000 gallons, but only 2/5 of that amount was expired. So, the company only sold 2/5 of the milk, and the rest was returned. So, the company actually only made money on the 2/5 of the milk that was still good.

So, first, I need to find out how much milk was actually sold. That would be 2/5 of 4000 gallons. Let me calculate that. 2/5 of 4000 is equal to (2/5) * 4000. Hmm, 4000 divided by 5 is 880, right? Because 5 times 880 is 4400, which is 400 more than 4000. Wait, no, 5 times 800 is 4000. So, 4000 divided by 5 is 880. Then, 2/5 of 4000 is 2 times 880, which is 1760 gallons. So, the company sold 1760 gallons of milk.

Each gallon was sold at $3.5, so the total amount the company made from selling the good milk is 1760 multiplied by 3.5. Let me compute that. 1760 times 3 is 5280, and 1760 times 0.5 is 880. So, adding those together, 5280 plus 880 is 6160. So, the company made $6160 from selling the good milk.

But wait, the company also had to return the 2/5 of the milk that was expired. So, the company had to refund the amount that was returned. The amount returned is 2/5 of 4000 gallons, which is 1600 gallons. So, the company had to refund $3.5 per gallon for 1600 gallons. Let me calculate that. 1600 times 3.5. Hmm, 1600 times 3 is 4800, and 1600 times 0.5 is 800. So, adding those together, 4800 plus 800 is 5680. So, the company had to refund $5680.

Wait, but the question is asking how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds. So, is it the amount he got back, which is the refund amount, or is it the total amount he received? Hmm, let me read the question again.

"A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds."

So, he got a refund. So, the amount he got back is the refund amount, which is the amount he had to refund, which is $5680. So, the answer is $5680.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through it again.

Total milk sold: 4000 gallons. 2/5 of that is 1760 gallons. 1760 gallons sold at $3.5 each. So, 1760 * 3.5. Let me compute that again. 1760 * 3 is 5280, and 1760 * 0.5 is 880. So, 5280 + 880 is 6160. So, the company made $6160.

Then, the amount returned is 2/5 of
