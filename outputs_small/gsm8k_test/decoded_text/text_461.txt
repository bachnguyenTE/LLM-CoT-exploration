Q: Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. If Frederick has 10 plants, how many plants does Shondra have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants. I need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many plants Frederick has. The problem says Frederick has 10 plants. That seems straightforward. So, Frederick = 10 plants.

Next, it says that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and then add that to Frederick's number to get the total number of plants for Toni.

Let me write that down. 60% of 10 plants. To calculate 60% of 10, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60. So, 0.60 multiplied by 10.

Wait, 0.60 times 10. Let me do that multiplication. 0.60 * 10. Well, 0.60 is the same as 6.6, right? Because 0.60 is 6.6 when you remove the decimal. So, 6.6 times 10 is 66. So, 60% of 10 is 6.6? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 60% of 10 is 6.6? Let me check that again.

Wait, 60% is 0.66 in decimal. So, 0.66 * 10. Let me compute that. 0.66 * 10 is 6.6. Yeah, that's correct. So, 66% of 10 is 6.6. So, that means, since 60% is 0.66, multiplying by 10 gives 6.6. So, 6.6 is the number of plants that is 60% more than Frederick's 10 plants.

So, then, the number of plants that Tonia has is Frederick's plants plus 6.6. So, 10 + 6.6 is 16.6. So, Tonia has 16.6 plants.

Wait, hold on, 16.6 seems like a decimal. Is that okay? The problem doesn't specify that the number has to be a whole number, so maybe it's okay. But let me think again.

Wait, 60% of 10 is 6, so 10 + 6 is 16. So, why is it 6.6? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 60% of 10 is 6, so 10 + 6 is 16. So, why is it 6.6? Maybe I confused the percentage. Let me double-check.

Wait, 60% of 10 is 6, so 10 + 6 is 16. So, 60% more than 10 is 16. So, why did I get 6.6 earlier? Maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, 60% of 10 is 0.60 * 10 = 6.0. So, 10 + 6.0 is 16.0. So, 16 plants. So, why did I get 6.6 earlier? Maybe I multiplied 0.66 instead of 0.60. So, that was a mistake.

So, okay, so 60% of 10 is 6. So, 10 + 6 is 16. So, Tonia has 16 plants.

Wait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. So, maybe I confused 60% with 60%. So, 600% of 10 is 6.6, but 60% of 10 is 6. So, that's where I messed up.

So, okay, so Tonia has 16 plants.

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Tonia. So, Shondra = Tonia - 7.

So, 16 - 7 is 9. So, Shondra has 9 plants.

Wait, so is that the answer? 9 plants.

But let me go through it again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Frederick has 10 plants.

Toni has 60% more than Frederick. So, 60% of 10 is
