Q: For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. How many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total volume of medicine in one dose. Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with three times that amount of the second medicine. 

So, the second medicine is 14 mL multiplied by 3, which equals 42 mL.

Adding both medicines together, the total volume for one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Next, to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, I multiply the total volume of one dose by 8.

56 mL/dose multiplied by 8 doses equals 448 mL.

To determine the total volume of medicine in 8 doses, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the second medicine in one dose:**
   
   \[
   3 \times 14\ \text{mL} = 42\ \text{mL}
   \]

2. **Find the total volume of medicine in one dose:**
   
   \[
   14\ \text{ mL} + 42\ \text{mL} = 56\ \text{mL}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total volume for 8 doses:**
   
   \[
   56\ \text{mL/dose} \times 8\ \text{doses} = 448\ \text{mL}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{448\ \text{mL}}
\]
