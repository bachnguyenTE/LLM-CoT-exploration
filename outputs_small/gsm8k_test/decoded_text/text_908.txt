Q: Dean has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5  of them to Jamie and gives 10 to Donald. How many marbles are left for Dean?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. He has 30 marbles and gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. Calculating 1/5 of 30 gives 6 marbles.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. Adding these to the 6 marbles given to Jamie, a total of 16 + 10 = 16 marbles are distributed.

Finally, to find out how many marbles are left with Dean, I subtract the total given away from the original number of marbles. So, 33 marbles minus 16 marbles equals 17 marbles remaining.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Total Marbles:** Dean starts with **33 marbles**.

2. **Marbles Given to Jamie:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 33 = \frac{33}{5} = 6.6 \text{ marbles}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a marble, we'll consider this as **6 marbles**.

3. **Marbles Given to Donald:**
   \[
   10 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Total Marbles Given Away:**
   \[
   6 + 10 = 16 \text{ marbles}
   \]

5. **Marbles Remaining with Dean:**
   \[
   33 - 16 = 17 \text{ marbles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
