A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Sally has these math quiz scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. I need to find her mean score. Hmm, mean is the average, right? So I think I need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes. Let me write that down.

First, let me list all her scores again to make sure I have them all: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60. Wait, hold on, the way it's written, some of these numbers have two digits, like 80, 90, etc. So I need to make sure I don't mix up the numbers. Let me write them all out as individual numbers without the commas or anything. So, 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60. Wait, no, that's not right. The original scores are 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Wait, hold on, 110? That's three digits. Did I misread that? Let me check the original question again.

"Sally received the following scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60." Oh, okay, so 110 is actually 100, which is 110? Wait, no, 110 is 110, but in the original list, it's written as 110? Wait, no, the original list is 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 110, 70, 60. Wait, no, the original list is 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. Wait, hold on, the user wrote: "50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60."
