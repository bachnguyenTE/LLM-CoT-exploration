Q: Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, how big is Timothy's locker in cubic inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Zack's, Timothy's, and Peter's lockers. It says Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. Then, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. And they tell me that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. I need to find out how big Timothy's locker is. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably assign some variables to each locker to make it easier. Let me call Zack's locker size Z, Timothy's T, and Peter's P. So, according to the problem:

1. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. So, mathematically, that would be Z = (1/2) * T. Or, in other words, Z = T/2.

2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. So, P = (1/4) * Z. Or, P = Z/4.

3. They tell me that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. So, P = 5.

Alright, so I have these three equations:

1. Z = T/2

2. P = Z/4

3. P = 5

I need to find T, the size of Timothy's locker. So, let's see. Since I know P is 5, I can use equation 2 to find Z. Then, once I have Z, I can use equation 1 to find T.

Starting with equation 2: P = Z/4. Since P is 5, I can plug that in:

5 = Z/4

To solve for Z, I can multiply both sides by 4:

5 * 4 = Z

So, Z = 20.

Wait, so Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches? Hmm, that seems a bit small, but maybe it's okay. Let me check.

If Zack's locker is 20, then according to equation 1, T = 2 * Z. So, T = 2 * 20 = 40.

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. That seems reasonable. Let me verify with the given information.

First, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's: 20 is half of 40. That checks out.

Second, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's: 20 is 1/4 of 80, but wait, hold on. Wait, Peter's locker is 5, which is 1/4 of Zack's. So, Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20. That's correct.

So, yes, that seems to add up. So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations. So, Peter's locker is 1/4 of Zack's. So, if Zack is 20, then Peter is 5. That's correct. So, 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of ratios. Zack is half as big as Timothy, so the ratio of Zack to Timothy is 1:2. Then, Peter is 1/4 of Zack, so the ratio of Peter to Zack is 1:4. So, if I combine these ratios, Peter:Zack:Timothy would be 1:4:8, because Zack is 2 parts and Peter is 1 part, so to make Zack's 4 parts, Peter is 1 part, so the ratio of Peter to Zack is 1:4, and Zack to Timothy is 2:1, so overall, Peter:Zack:Timothy is 1:4:8.

So, if Peter is 5, then each unit is 5. So, Timothy is 8 units, which is 8 * 5 = 40. So, that also gives me 40. So, that's another way to think about it, and it also gives me the same answer. So, that seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step without ratios. Let's see.

Given that Peter's locker is 5, and Peter's is 1/4 of Zack's, so Zack's is 4 times Peter's. So, Zack's is 4 * 5 = 20. Then, Zack's is half of Timothy's, so Timothy's is 2 * 20 = 40. So, same answer.

So, all the different ways I think about it, it's 40. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me write it out step by step.
