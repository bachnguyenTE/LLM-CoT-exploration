Q: Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age now is 162. I need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios. I remember that ratios compare two quantities. So, if Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, that means for every 7 years Darrell is older than Allen, Allen is 11 years old. Wait, actually, hold on. Ratios can be a bit confusing sometimes. Let me make sure I get this right.

The ratio is 7:11, which I think means that for every 7 years Darrell is older than Allen, Allen is 11 years old. Or is it that Darrell is 7 parts and Allen is 11 parts? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, no, ratios can be a bit tricky. If it's 7:11, that could mean that Darrell is 7 times as old as Allen, but that doesn't make sense because 7:11 would be a different ratio. Wait, no, 7:11 is 7 to 1, so that would mean Darrell is 7 times as old as Allen. But that seems a bit high. Let me think.

Wait, no, actually, ratios can be presented in different ways. If it's 7:11, that would mean Darrell is 7 parts and Allen is 11 parts. So, the total number of parts is 7 + 11 = 18 parts. So, each part would be 162 divided by 18, which is 9. So, Allen's age would be 11 parts, which is 99, and Darrell's age would be 7 parts, which is 63. So, 63 + 99 is 162, which matches the total age given. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but the ratio is 7:11, so is that 7:11 or 7:11? Maybe I misread it. Let me check the problem again. It says Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. So, 7:11. So, that's 7 to 11, so 7 parts to 11 parts. So, that's 7:11, which is 7:1? Wait, no, 7:11 is 7 to 11, so 7 parts to 11 parts. So, that's 7:11.

So, the total number of parts is 7 + 11 = 18 parts. So, each part is 162 divided by 18, which is 20.25. So, Allen's age is 11 parts, which is 11 * 20.25 = 222.75. Wait, that can't be right because 222.75 + 60.75 is 283.5, which is way more than 162. So, that can't be.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the ratio. Maybe it's 7:11, meaning 7:1, so 7 to 1. So, 7:1. So, that would mean Darrell is 7 times as old as Allen. So, if Allen is x years old, Darrell is 7x. Then, their total age is x + 7x = 8x = 162. So, x = 162 /8 = 20.25. So, Allen is 20.25 years old, and Darrell is 141.75 years old. Then, 10 years from now, Allen would be 20.25 +10=30.25 years old. So, 33.25? Wait, 20.25 +10 is 30.25, which is 30.25. So, 30.25 years old.

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Let me check again. If the ratio is 7:11, which is 7:1, so 7 parts to 1 part. So, total parts 8, so each part is 162 /8=20.25. So, Allen is 1 part, so 22.25. So, 10 years from now, he'll be 32.25. So,
