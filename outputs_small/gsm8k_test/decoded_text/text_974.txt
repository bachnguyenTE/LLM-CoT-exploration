Q: Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tyler wants to buy some books, and I need to figure out how many hours he has to work to afford all of them. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what Tyler needs to buy. He wants a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that's $13, and a children's cookbook that's $8. Hmm, so I should add up the total cost of these books to see how much money he needs altogether.

Let me write that out: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook). Let me add them up. 18 plus 13 is 31, and then 31 plus 8 is 39. So, the total cost of all the books is $39.

Now, Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, I need to figure out how much more money he needs to buy the books. To do that, I'll subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books. That would be $39 minus $14.

Let me calculate that: 39 minus 14. Hmm, 39 minus 10 is 28, and then minus 3 more is 25. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it properly. 39 minus 14. 14 is 10 plus 4. So, 39 minus 10 is 29, and then minus 4 is 25. So, Tyler needs an additional $25.

Alright, so Tyler needs $25 more to buy all the books. Now, he earns $5 per hour. I need to find out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. That seems straightforward.

So, if he earns $5 each hour, how many hours does he need to work to get $25? Well, I can set up a simple equation: 5 dollars/hour multiplied by the number of hours equals $25. So, 5h = 25. To find h, I divide both sides by 5. So, h = 25 / 5, which is 5. So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours.

Wait, let me double-check that. If he works 5 hours at $5 per hour, that's 5 times 5, which is 25. And he needs 25 more dollars, so that adds up correctly. So, yes, 5 hours is the right answer.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier, let me go through the steps again. The total cost of the books: dictionary is 18, dinosaur is 13, cookbook is 8. 18 + 13 is 31, plus 8 is 39. He has saved 14, so 39 minus 14 is 25. He needs 25 more. He makes 5 per hour, so 25 divided by 5 is 5. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford all his books.

**Final Answer**
Tyler has to work \boxed{5} hours.

Tyler wants to buy a dictionary, a dinosaur book, and a children's cookbook. The costs of these books are $18, $13, and $8 respectively. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the books:
\[
18 + 13 + 8 = 39
\]

Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:
\[
39 - 14 = 25
\]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To determine how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we set up the equation:
\[
5h = 25
\]
Solving for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{25}{5} = 5
\]

Thus, Tyler has to work \boxed{5} hours.
