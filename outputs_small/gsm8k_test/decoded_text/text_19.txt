Q: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?

Okay, so Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, then the next 2 miles in another hour. Now, she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire trail. I need to figure out what speed she needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve that average speed.

First, let me recall what average speed means. Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. So, if she wants an average speed of 4 mph over 12 miles, I can calculate the total time she should have taken.

Let me write that down:

Total distance = 12 miles

Desired average speed = 4 mph

So, total time = total distance / average speed = 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

Okay, so she needs to complete the entire 12-mile trail in 3 hours to have an average speed of 4 mph.

Now, let's see how much time she has already spent. She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. So, total time so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.

That means she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance.

Wait, let me check that. The trail is 12 miles. She did 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. So, remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. She has 1 hour left to cover that 6 miles. So, her speed needs to be 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate her current average speed and see how much she needs to increase it.

She did the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so that's 4 mph. Then, the next 2 miles took her 1 hour, so that's 2 mph. So, her current average speed is (4 + 2)/2 = 3 mph. But she wants an average speed of 4 mph, which is higher than her current average. So, she needs to increase her speed in the remaining 6 miles.

Wait, but she only has 1 hour left. So, if she walks 6 miles in 1 hour, that's 6 mph. So, that's the required speed.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of total time. She has 3 hours total, and she's already used 2 hours, so she needs to finish in 1 hour. So, 6 miles in 1 hour is 6 mph.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for average speed when the distances are equal but speeds are different. But in this case, the distances are different, so maybe it's better to think in terms of total time.

Wait, another way: Let me denote the remaining distance as D, which is 6 miles, and the time she has left as T, which is 1 hour. So, speed needed is D / T = 6 / 1 = 6 mph.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total time she has already taken and the total time she needs. She has 2 hours already, needs 3 hours, so she needs to take 1 hour for the remaining 6 miles.

So, yes, 6 mph is the required speed.

Wait, but let me make sure that 6 mph is correct. Let me calculate the total distance and total time.

If she walks the first 4 miles at 4 mph, that takes 1 hour. Then, she walks the next 2 miles at 2 mph, which takes 1 hour. Then, she walks the last 6 miles at 6 mph, which takes 1 hour. So, total time is 3 hours, total distance is 12 miles. So, average speed is 12 / 3 = 4 mph. That's correct.

Alternatively, if she tried to walk the last 6 miles at a different speed, say 5 mph, then the time would be 6 / 5 = 1.2 hours, so total time would be 2 + 1.2 = 3.2 hours, which is more than 3 hours, so her average speed would be 12 / 3.2 = 3.75 mph, which is less than 4 mph. So, she needs to walk faster than 6 mph to make up for the time.

Wait, but in this case, she only has 1 hour left, so she can't walk faster than 6 mph because that would take more than 1 hour. So, 6 mph is the only way to make up the time.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of harmonic mean or
