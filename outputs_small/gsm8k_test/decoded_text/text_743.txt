Q: Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mara adding cake slices and then tripling them, eating some, and her friend stealing some. I need to figure out how many slices are left. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices. So, let me write that down. Initially, there are 2 slices. Then she adds 3 more. Hmm, so 2 plus 3. That should be 5 slices. Let me check that: 2 + 3 = 5. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, it says she was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. Hmm, okay, so she had 5 slices, and she tripled that. Tripling means multiplying by 3, right? So, 5 times 3. Let me calculate that: 5 * 3 = 15. Wait, that's the same as before? That seems a bit confusing. So, after tripling, she has 15 slices? That seems like a lot, but okay, maybe it's right.

Then, she ate 2 slices. So, from 15, she ate 2. So, 15 - 2. Let me do that: 15 - 2 = 13. So, now she has 13 slices left. Hmm, that's a lot, but okay.

But then, while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. So, from 13, her friend took away 5. So, 13 - 5. Let me subtract that: 13 - 5 = 8. So, 8 slices remain on the plate.

Wait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 2 slices, adding 3 makes 5. Tripling 5 gives 15. She eats 2, so 15 - 2 is 13. Then, her friend takes 5, so 13 - 5 is 8. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me think if I interpreted the tripling correctly. The problem says she was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, she had 5 slices, and then she tripled that. So, 5 * 3 is 15. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes when problems say "triple," it can be a bit ambiguous, but in this case, it seems like it's straightforward multiplication. So, 5 * 3 is 15.

Then, she ate 2 slices, so 15 - 2 is 13. Then, her friend stole 5, so 13 -5 is 8. So, 8 slices remain.

Wait, but let me think again. When she tripled the number of slices, was that from the original 2 or from the current 5? The wording is a bit confusing. It says, "she was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has." So, "she currently has" refers to the number after adding the 3 slices. So, she had 2, added 3, making 5, then tripled that 5. So, 5 *3 is 15. So, that part is correct.

So, yeah, 15 slices, then she ate 2, so 13, then her friend took 5, so 8. So, 8 is the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the order of operations. Sometimes, in word problems, the order can be tricky. So, let's parse the sentence again: "She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has." So, she had 2, added 3, making 5, then tripled that 5. So, 5 *3 is 15. Then, she ate 2, so 13, then her friend stole 5, so 8. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, if it had said she added 3 slices and then tripled the total, that would be different. But in this case, it's "she was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has." So, the current number is 5, so tripled that.

So, yeah, 8 is the answer.

Wait, but let me think about the wording again. "She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has." So, "she currently has" is the number after adding the 3 slices. So, 2 +3 =5, then tripled, so 15. So, that's
