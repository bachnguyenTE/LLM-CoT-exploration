Q: Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Courtney said there were 48 people at a concert, but Kelly said that Courtney was wrong because she overstated the number by 20%. I need to figure out how many people actually attended the concert if Kelly was right. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Courtney said the attendance was 48. Kelly said that this was a 20% overstatement. So, Kelly is saying that 48 is 20% more than the actual number. Therefore, the actual number must be less than 48. I need to find the real number of attendees.

Alright, so if 48 is 20% more than the actual number, that means 48 is equal to the actual number plus 20% of the actual number. Let me write that down as an equation. Let me denote the actual number of people as x. So, according to Kelly, 48 is equal to x plus 20% of x. Which can be written as:

48 = x + 0.20x

Hmm, combining like terms, that would be 48 = 1.20x. Wait, 1.20 is the same as 120%, right? So, 1.20 times x equals 48. So, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 1.20.

So, x = 48 / 1.20

Let me compute that. 48 divided by 1.20. Hmm, 1.20 goes into 48 how many times? Let me think. 1.20 times 40 is 48 because 1.20 times 40 is 48.8, which is too much. Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Alternatively, I can convert 1.20 into a fraction. 1.20 is the same as 120/100, which simplifies to 6/5. So, 48 divided by (6/5) is the same as 48 multiplied by (5/6). So, 48 * 5 = 240, and 240 divided by 6 is 40. So, x is 40.

Wait, so the actual number is 40? Let me check that. If the actual number is 40, then 20% of 40 is 8. So, 40 plus 8 is 48. That matches what Kelly said. So, yes, that makes sense.

But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 48 is 20% more than x. So, 48 is equal to x multiplied by 1.20. So, x is 48 divided by 1.20. Let me compute 48 divided by 1.20.

Alternatively, I can think of 1.20 as 12/10, so 48 divided by (12/10) is 48 multiplied by (10/12). So, 48 times 10 is 480, divided by 12 is 40. So, that's the same result. So, x is 40.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

Wait, just to double-check, if the actual number is 40, then 20% of 40 is 8.8, right? So, 40 plus 8.8 is 48.8, which is not 48. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, hold on, 20% of 40 is 0.8, so 44 plus 0.8 is 44.8, which is not 48. Wait, no, I think I messed up the percentage.

Wait, 20% of 40 is 8, so 40 plus 8 is 52, which is way more than 48. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, hold on, I think I confused the percentage.

Wait, no, let me clarify. If 48 is 20% more than the actual number, then 48 is equal to x + 0.20x, which is 1.20x. So, x is 48 / 1.20, which is 40. So, 40 plus 20% of 40 is 8, which is 48. So, that
