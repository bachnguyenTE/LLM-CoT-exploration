Q: Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Kim and her sleep. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. So that's a total of 8 hours. Let me convert that into minutes because the answer needs to be in minutes. 8 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 480 minutes. So, she sleeps for 480 minutes a day.

Now, on this particular day, she found a camera and decided to sleepwalk. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. Wait, hold on, the problem says she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she went to the bathroom at 2:15 am, right? Because she usually goes to bed at 10 p.m., so she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. So, 5 minutes earlier would be 2:10 am. Hmm, wait, let me make sure.

Wait, 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours. So, 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. is 1 hour, 11 p.m. to 12 p.m. is another hour, 12 to 1 is an hour, 1 to 2 is another hour, 2 to 3 is an hour, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6. So, yeah, 8 hours. So, 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.

So, on this day, she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, she went to the bathroom at 2:10 am instead of 2:15 am. So, she started sleepwalking at 2:10 am and ended at 2:38 am. So, how long did she sleepwalk?

Let me calculate the duration. From 2:10 to 2:38. So, from 2:10 to 2:30 is 20 minutes, and then from 2:30 to 2:38 is 8 minutes. So, total is 28 minutes. So, she slept 28 minutes on that day.

But wait, the question is asking how many minutes she slept on her bed that day. So, she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier, so she didn't sleep for the full 8 hours. Instead, she slept from 2:10 am to 2:38 am, which is 28 minutes. So, is that the answer? 28 minutes.

But let me double-check. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. On this day, she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier, so she didn't sleep for the full 8 hours. Instead, she slept from 2:10 am to 2:38 am, which is 28 minutes. So, yes, 28 minutes.

Wait, but hold on, is that the total time she slept? Or is it the time she was awake? Because she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier, so she was awake for 28 minutes, but she also had to wake up at 6 a.m. So, does that mean she had to go to bed at 10 p.m., but she went to the bathroom earlier, so she had to adjust her sleep schedule.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the total time she was awake. So, she usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. On this day, she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier, so she had to wake up 5 minutes later than usual. So, she went to the bathroom at 2:10 am, and then she had to wake up at 6 a.m. So, she was awake from 2:10 am to 6 a.m. So, how long is that?

From 2:10 am to 6 a.m. is 5 hours and 50 minutes. Let me calculate that. From 2:10 to 6:00 is 5 hours and 50 minutes. So, 5 hours is 300 minutes, plus 50 minutes is 350 minutes. So, 350 minutes. So, she was awake for 350 minutes on that day.

But wait, the question is asking how many minutes she slept on her bed that day. So, she went to the bathroom 5 minutes earlier, so she didn't sleep for the full 8 hours
