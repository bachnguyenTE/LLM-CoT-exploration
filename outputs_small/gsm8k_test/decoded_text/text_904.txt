Q: There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies, Deepa has seen each one in the theatre three times. She has spent $216 seeing these movies. What is the average price she paid per ticket?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Deepa and the Fast and Furious movies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 9 movies, and Deepa has seen each one three times. She spent a total of $216 on seeing these movies. They're asking for the average price she paid per ticket. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to find the average price per ticket. That means I have to figure out the total amount she spent divided by the total number of tickets she bought. So, I know the total amount is $216. But I need to know how many tickets she saw in total.

She saw each of the 9 movies three times. So, for each movie, she bought 3 tickets. That means for each movie, she spent 3 times the price of one ticket. So, for all 9 movies, the total number of tickets would be 9 multiplied by 3. Let me write that down.

Total number of tickets = Number of movies × Number of times each movie was seen
Total number of tickets = 9 × 3
Total number of tickets = 27

Okay, so she bought 27 tickets in total. Now, the total amount she spent is $216. Wait, hold on, is that $216 or $216? The way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me check the original problem again.

It says, "She has spent $216 seeing these movies." Hmm, in some countries, $216 is written as $216, but in others, it's written as $216. But in the problem, it's written as $216. So, is that $216 or $216? Maybe it's a typo or something. But in any case, the total amount is $216, which is 216 dollars. So, that's 216 dollars. So, $216 is 216 dollars.

So, total amount = $216
Total number of tickets = 27

So, to find the average price per ticket, I need to divide the total amount by the total number of tickets.

Average price per ticket = Total amount / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

Hmm, let me compute that. 216 divided by 27. Let me see, 27 times 8 is 216, right? Because 27 times 7 is 189, and 27 more is 216. So, 27 times 8 is 216. So, 216 divided by 27 is 8.

Wait, so the average price per ticket is $8? That seems a bit high, but let me think. If she saw each movie three times, and each time she spent $8, that would be 3 times $8, which is $24 per movie. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 3 times $8 is $24, but she spent $216 in total. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, hold on. If the average price per ticket is $8, then each ticket was $8, and she bought 27 tickets, so total cost would be 27 times 8, which is 216. That's correct. So, 27 tickets at $8 each is $216. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If she saw each of the 9 movies three times, that's 27 tickets. So, 27 tickets for $216. So, the average price per ticket is $216 divided by 27, which is $8. So, that's correct.

But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 9 times 3 is 27, that's correct. 216 divided by 27, let me do the division again. 27 times 8 is 216, so yes, 216 divided by 27 is 8. So, the average price per ticket is $8.

Wait, but let me think about the units. The total amount is in dollars, and the number of tickets is unitless, so the average price per ticket is in dollars, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as per movie. She saw each movie three times, so for each movie, she spent 3 times the price. So, for each movie, the total cost is 3 times the price. So, if I let p be the price per ticket, then for each movie,
