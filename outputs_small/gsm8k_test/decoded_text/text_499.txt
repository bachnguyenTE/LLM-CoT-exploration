Q: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Okay, so Mark is trying to choose between two venues for his wife's surprise party. He wants to know how many guests are needed for both venues to cost the same. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's break down the costs for each venue.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, no matter how many guests come. That seems straightforward. So, if Mark has, say, 10 guests, he just pays $200. It doesn't matter if 10, 20, or 30 guests come; the cost is always $200.

The second venue is a bit more complicated. It charges $25 per person. But wait, the problem says that the first venue doesn't include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 per person. So, for each guest, the second venue charges $25, but the first venue doesn't charge for food, which is $5 per person. 

But the second venue says that food for each guest is already included in the price. Hmm, so does that mean that the second venue's base fee includes the food? Or is the base fee separate? Let me read that again.

"However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price."

So, the first venue charges $200 regardless, but doesn't include food. So, if Mark wants to have food, he has to pay an extra $5 per person. The second venue, on the other hand, charges $25 per person, but food is already included in that price. So, the second venue's base fee is $25 per person, but since food is already included, Mark doesn't have to pay extra for it.

Wait, so that means the second venue's total cost is $25 per person, but the first venue's total cost is $200 plus $5 per person for food. So, to find when they are equal, we need to set up an equation where the total cost of the first venue equals the total cost of the second venue.

Let me define the number of guests as 'x'. Then, the total cost for the first venue is $200, regardless of x. The total cost for the second venue is $25 times x, because each person's food is already included. So, the equation would be:

200 = 25x

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

First venue: $200 flat fee + $5 per person for food. So, total cost is 200 + 5x.

Second venue: $25 per person, with food already included. So, total cost is 25x.

So, setting them equal: 200 + 5x = 25x.

Yes, that makes sense. So, solving for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 10

So, 10 guests would make the costs equal.

Wait, let me verify that. If there are 10 guests:

First venue: $200 + 10*$5 = $200 + $50 = $250.

Second venue: 10*$25 = $250.

Yes, that's correct. So, 10 guests would make both venues cost $250.

But wait, let me think again. The first venue is flat fee, so it's more expensive per guest, but the second venue is per person with food included. So, the first venue is cheaper per guest, but the second is more expensive per guest. So, there must be a point where they cross.

So, when x is 10, both are $250. So, that's the break-even point.

Wait, but let me think about the per-person cost. First venue: $200 flat fee, so per person, it's 200 / x. Second venue: 25 per person, with food included. So, the per-person cost for the first venue is 200 / x, and for the second, it's 25.

So, when is 200 / x = 25?

200 / x = 25

Multiply both sides by x:

200 = 25x

Divide both sides by 25:

x = 200 / 25 = 8.

Wait, so that's 8 guests. But earlier, when I set up the equation, I got 10 guests. So, which
