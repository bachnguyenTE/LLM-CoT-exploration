Q: Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Adrien and Lylah's salaries. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, it says Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Hmm, okay. So if I let Lylah's salary be some amount, Adrien's would be 30% more than that. Maybe I can represent Lylah's salary as L and Adrien's as A. So, A = L + 30% of L, which is the same as A = 1.30L. That makes sense.

Then, four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. Wait, so four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000. So, four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000. So, four years later, his salary is 40% higher than that. So, I need to calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original amount.

But hold on, the problem says that both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. So, Lylah's salary might have also increased, but we don't know by what percentage. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify Lylah's salary increase percentage, only Adrien's. So, maybe I need to figure out Lylah's salary first, or maybe it's not necessary.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says, "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?"

So, key points:

1. Adrien's salary four years ago: $40,000.

2. Four years later, Adrien's salary is 40% higher than four years ago. So, 40% of $40,000 is... let me calculate that. 40% of 40,000 is 0.4 * 40,000 = 16,000. So, his salary four years later is 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000.

3. Lylah's salary four years ago was such that Adrien's salary was 30% higher. So, if Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 40% less than Adrien's.

Wait, so if Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, then Lylah's salary four years ago was 100% - 30% = 70% of Adrien's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was 70% of 40,000.

Calculating that: 0.7 * 40,000 = 28,000.

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28,000.

But the problem says that both salaries increased simultaneously. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $28,000, and now, four years later, it's increased by some percentage. But we don't know by what percentage. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify Lylah's salary increase percentage. Wait, let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says, "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's." So, that was four years ago. Then, four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, that's 40% increase on Adrien's four years ago salary, which is 40% of 40,000, which is 16,000, so 40,000.

But Lylah's salary four years ago was 28,000, and it's not specified by what percentage it increased. So, maybe we can't determine Lylah's salary four years later without more information. Wait, but the problem is asking for the total salary the two were receiving four years later. So, maybe we can just add Adrien's four years later salary to Lylah's four years later salary.

But we don
