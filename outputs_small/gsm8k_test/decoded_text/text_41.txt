Q: The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Polly and the dragon Perg. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the dragon is at Farbo, and it's breathing fire at anything within 1000 feet. Polly is holding a sapphire gemstone, and when she holds it, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when she isn't holding it. So, when she's not holding the gemstone, the javelin can go 400 feet. When she holds it, it's three times that distance, right? So, 400 feet times 3 is 1200 feet. 

Wait, hold on. So, without the gemstone, the javelin can reach 400 feet. With the gemstone, it can reach 1200 feet. But the question is asking, if Polly holds the gemstone, how far outside of the dragon's reach can she stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin. Hmm, so I think this is about the maximum distance she can stand and still be within the dragon's reach when she throws it.

So, the dragon's reach is 1000 feet. So, if Polly is standing outside of that, but when she throws the javelin, it needs to land within 1000 feet of the dragon. But when she holds the gemstone, the javelin can go up to 1200 feet. So, if she stands 1200 feet away, the javelin can reach up to 1200 feet, but the dragon only has a 1000 feet reach. So, the question is, how far outside can she stand and still hit the dragon? So, the maximum distance she can stand outside the dragon's reach is 1200 feet minus 1000 feet, which is 200 feet. 

Wait, let me think again. So, without the gemstone, the javelin can reach 400 feet. With the gemstone, it can reach 1200 feet farther, so 400 + 1200 = 1600 feet. Wait, no, the problem says "three times farther than when not holding the gemstone." So, 400 times 3 is 1200. So, when she holds the gemstone, the javelin can reach 1200 feet. So, the maximum distance she can stand is 1200 feet, but the dragon only has a 1000 feet reach. So, the extra distance she can stand beyond the dragon's reach is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. 

Wait, but hold on. If she stands 1200 feet away, the javelin can reach up to 1200 feet, but the dragon only has a 1000 feet reach. So, the javelin can hit the dragon because it's within 1000 feet. So, the maximum distance she can stand beyond the dragon's reach is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So, the answer is 200 feet.

But let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says, "how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin." So, the dragon's reach is 1000 feet. So, if Polly stands beyond that, but the javelin can reach up to 1200 feet, so the extra distance she can stand beyond the dragon's reach is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet. So, 200 feet is how far outside she can stand and still hit the dragon.

Wait, but hold on. Is it 1200 - 1000? Or is it 1200 - 1000? Because 1200 is the maximum reach when she holds the gemstone, and 1000 is the dragon's reach. So, the difference is 200 feet. So, Polly can stand 200 feet beyond the dragon's reach and still hit it with the javelin.

Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum distance she can stand such that the javelin can reach the dragon. So, if she stands at a point where the javelin can reach the dragon, which is 1000 feet. So, the maximum distance she can stand is 1200 feet, but the dragon can only reach 1000 feet. So, the extra distance is 200 feet.

Wait, but the problem says, "how far outside of the reach of the dragon's
