Q: Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.  He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mike and his pen pals. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Mike was a pen pal with 5 people. But then he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. So, how many pen pals does Mike have now? Hmm, if he was with 5 and then he stopped with 2, that means he's left with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals. So, he's writing letters to 3 people.

Each of them sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, I need to find out how many pages Mike writes in a week. Let me break that down.

Each person sends 2 letters, each letter is 5 pages. So, per person, that's 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week. Since he has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he writes is 3 * 10 = 30 pages per week.

Wait, hold on, 2 letters times 5 pages each is 10 pages per person, right? So, 3 people would be 3 * 10 = 30 pages. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. I need to find out how many hours he spends writing a week. So, first, let's figure out how many minutes he spends writing in a week, and then convert that to hours.

He writes 30 pages a week. If he writes 1 page every 6 minutes, then the total time in minutes is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page. Let me calculate that: 30 * 6. Hmm, 30 times 6 is 180 minutes.

But the question asks for hours, so I need to convert 180 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 divided by 60 is 3 hours.

Wait, let me double-check that. 30 pages * 6 minutes per page is indeed 180 minutes. 180 divided by 60 is 3. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is \boxed{3}.

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people but stopped being penpals with 2 of them, leaving him with 3 pen pals. Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, each letter being 5 pages long. 

Calculating the total number of pages Mike writes per week:
- Each pen pal writes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pages per week.
- With 3 pen pals, the total number of pages is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) pages per week.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Converting the total writing time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in minutes: \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.
- Converting minutes to hours: \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is \(\boxed{3}\).
