Q: Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about two trains leaving San Rafael. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, it says both trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. The question is asking for the distance each train covered in the two days.

Hmm, okay. So, each train is making two trips: one westward for 80 miles and then one northward for 150 miles. I need to figure out the total distance each train has covered over these two days.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So, both trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They go west for 80 miles, and then the next day, they go north for 150 miles. So, each train has two legs of their journey: one west and one north.

So, each train's total distance would be the sum of the westward and northward distances. That makes sense. So, for each train, it's 80 miles west and 150 miles north. So, adding those together should give the total distance each train has covered.

Let me write that down. So, total distance = 80 miles + 150 miles. Let me compute that. 80 plus 150. Hmm, 80 plus 150. Let me add the tens first: 80 is 80, 150 is 150. Wait, no, 80 is 80, 150 is 150. So, 80 + 150. 80 + 150 is 238? Wait, 80 + 150. Let me do it step by step.

80 + 150: 80 + 100 is 180, and then +50 is 180 +50=230. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 80 +150. Let me add the units first: 0 +5=5, tens:8 +5=13, so 235? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 is 80, 150 is 150. So, 80 +150. 80 +100 is 180, then +50 is 230. So, 230? Wait, 80 +150 is 230? That seems low. Wait, 80 +150 is 230? Let me check with another method.

If I think of 80 as 80, and 150 as 150, then 80 +150 is 230. Yeah, that's correct. So, each train has traveled 230 miles in total.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, each train goes west for 80 miles, then north for 150 miles. So, each train's journey is 80 west and 150 north. So, the total distance is 80 +150=230 miles. So, each train has covered 230 miles in total.

But wait, is that the case? Or is it 80 miles west and 150 miles north, so each train's displacement is 80 west and 150 north, but the total distance is 80 +150=230. So, yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but hold on. Is the question asking for the total distance each train has covered, or the displacement? Because displacement would be the straight-line distance from the starting point, but the question says "distance covered," which is total path traveled, not displacement.

So, yeah, each train has gone west 80 miles and then north 150 miles, so total distance is 80 +150=230 miles.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says "the next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles." So, is the next day 150 miles or 150 miles? Wait, the original problem says "covering 150 miles" or "150 miles"? Let me check.

Wait, the original problem says: "They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles." So, it's 150 miles, not 150. So, 150 miles.

So,
