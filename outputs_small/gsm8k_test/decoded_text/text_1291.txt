Q: Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, how many pens does Sarah have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about pens owned by Timothy, George, and Sarah. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. The problem says:

"Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, how many pens does Sarah have?"

Alright, so first, I need to find out how many pens Sarah has. To do that, I think I should start by figuring out how many pens Timothy has because the problem relates Timothy's pens to George's. Then, once I know Timothy's number, I can find out Sarah's.

Let me write down what I know:

1. George has 18 pens.
2. Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
3. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.

So, starting with George, he has 18 pens. That's straightforward. Now, Timothy has three times that. So, if George has 18, then Timothy must have 3 multiplied by 18. Let me calculate that.

3 times 18... Hmm, 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 8 is 24, so 30 plus 24 is 54. So, Timothy has 54 pens.

Okay, now that I know Timothy has 54 pens, the next part is about Sarah. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, if Timothy has 54 pens, Sarah has half of that. Let me compute half of 54.

Half of 54 is 27, right? Because 54 divided by 2 is 27. So, Sarah has 27 pens.

Wait, let me double-check that. If George has 18, Timothy has three times that, which is 54. Then, Sarah has half of 54, which is 27. That seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using variables? Let me try that to confirm.

Let G be the number of pens George has. So, G = 18.

Timothy has three times G, so T = 3G.

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so S = (1/2)T.

Substituting T into S, we get S = (1/2)(3G) = (3/2)G.

Since G is 18, S = (3/2)*18. Let me compute that.

3/2 of 18 is the same as 3 multiplied by 4, which is 12. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me do it step by step.

(3/2)*18: First, divide 18 by 2, which is 9, then multiply by 3, which is 27. So, 27 pens. That matches what I got earlier.

So, both methods give me 27 pens for Sarah. That seems consistent.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 27 pens.

**Final Answer**
Sarah has \boxed{27} pens.
</think>

George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, so Timothy has:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \text{ pens} \]

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the number of pens Sarah has is \(\boxed{27}\).
