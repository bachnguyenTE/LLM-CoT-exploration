Q: Darren decides to do body exercises for a whole week. He does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. What's the total count of the activities he's done in the two days?

Okay, so Darren is doing some body exercises for a week, and he's been doing them for two days now. I need to figure out the total count of all the activities he's done over these two days. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at what he did on the first day. He did 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. That seems straightforward. So, on day one, the total number of activities would be the sum of pushups, squats, and presses. Let me write that down:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

So, total for day one is 100 + 50 +20. Let me add those up. 100 plus 50 is 155, and then plus 20 is 175. So, 175 activities on day one.

Now, moving on to day two. The problem says he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, ten fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses. Hmm, okay, let me parse that.

Starting with pushups: On day one, he did 100 pushups. On day two, he does 20 more. So, that would be 100 +20. Let me calculate that. 100 plus 20 is 120. So, 120 pushups on day two.

Next, squats: On day one, he did 50 squats. On day two, he does ten fewer. So, that would be 50 minus 10. Let me do that subtraction. 50 minus 10 is 40. So, 40 squats on day two.

Then, dumbbell presses: On day one, he did 20. On day two, he doubles that number. So, 20 times 2. Let me compute that. 20 times 2 is 40. So, 40 dumbbell presses on day two.

Alright, so now, let's summarize day two:

- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Now, let's find the total for day two. That would be 120 +40 +40. Let me add those up. 120 plus 40 is 160, and then plus another 40 is 200. So, 200 activities on day two.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. 120 pushups, 40 squats, 40 presses. 120 plus 40 is 160, plus 40 is 200. Yeah, that seems right.

So, now, to find the total count over the two days, I need to add day one's total and day two's total. So, 175 plus 200. Let me add those. 175 plus 200 is 375. So, 375 total activities over the two days.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.

First day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats:50
- Presses:20
Total:100+50=155; 155+20=175. That's correct.

Second day:
- Pushups:100+20=120
- Squats:50-10=40
- Presses:20*2=40
Total:120+40=164; 164+40=204. Wait, hold on, 120+40 is 160, plus 40 is 200. Wait, 120+40 is 160, plus 40 is 200? Wait, 120+40 is 160, plus 40 is 200? Wait, 120+40 is 160, plus 40 is 200. Wait, 120+40 is 160, plus 40 is 200. Yeah, that's correct.

So, day two total is 200. So, 175 plus 200 is 375. So, 375 total
