Q: Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Carly gets back after buying these hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, let's see what each item costs. She ordered five hamburgers, each costing $4. Hmm, so I should multiply the number of hamburgers by the price per hamburger. That would be 5 times $4. Let me write that down: 5 * $4. Hmm, 5 times 4 is 20, so that's $20. Okay, so the hamburgers cost her $20 in total.

Next, she bought ten packs of potato fries. Each pack is $0.30. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the potato fries. That would be 10 packs multiplied by $0.30 per pack. So, 10 * $0.30. Let me do that multiplication. 10 times 0.3 is 3. So, the potato fries cost her $3 in total.

Then, she bought five cans of fruit drinks, each costing $2. So, similar to the hamburgers, I need to multiply the number of drinks by the price per drink. That's 5 * $2. Let me calculate that. 5 times 2 is 10, so that's $10 for the fruit drinks.

Now, I need to add up all these costs to find the total amount Carly spent. So, the hamburgers were $20, the potato fries were $3, and the fruit drinks were $10. Let me add them together: $20 + $3 + $10. 

Starting with $20 plus $3 is $23. Then, adding $10 to that gives me $33. So, the total amount Carly spent is $33.

But wait, she gave a fifty-dollar bill to the cashier. So, to find out how much change she gets back, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave. That would be $50 (the fifty-dollar bill) minus $33 (the total cost). Let me do that subtraction: $50 - $33.

Subtracting $3 from $50 gives me $47. So, the change she gets back is $47.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Hamburgers: 5 * $4 = $20. That seems right. 

Potato fries: 10 * $0.30. Hmm, 10 times 0.3 is 3, so $3. That's correct.

Fruit drinks: 5 * $2 = $10. Yep, that's right.

Total cost: $20 + $3 + $10. 20 + 3 is 23, plus 10 is 33. So, $33 total.

Fifty dollars minus $33 is $47. That seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the change is $47.

**Final Answer**
The change Carly gets back is \boxed{47} dollars.

Carly orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each. 

First, calculate the cost of each item:
- The cost of five hamburgers: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The cost of ten packs of potato fries: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars.
- The cost of five cans of fruit drinks: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars.

Next, add up the total cost:
- Total cost: \(20 + 3 + 10 = 33\) dollars.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
- Change: \(50 - 33 = 47\) dollars.

The change Carly gets back is \(\boxed{47}\) dollars.
