Q: A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a Tyrannosaurus rex eating a triceratops. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate it. Hmm, okay.

First, the problem says that the T-Rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. So, let me parse that. If the T-Rex ate half, that means the remaining meat is half of what it had. But wait, the triceratops is a type of dinosaur, right? So, I think a triceratops is a large reptile, maybe similar to a triceratops, which is a type of triceratops. Wait, actually, I think a triceratops is a large herbivore, similar to a triceratops, which is a type of triceratops. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to visualize this. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops it had. So, if the triceratops had, say, M kilograms of meat, the T-Rex ate half of that, which is M/2. So, the remaining meat would be M - M/2 = M/2. So, half of the triceratops' meat was left after the T-Rex ate.

Then, the problem says that a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, after the T-Rex ate, there was M/2 left. The velociraptors took half of that, so they took (M/2)/2 = M/4. So, the meat left after the velociraptors had their meal would be M/2 - M/4 = M/4.

Then, a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. So, that means M/4 = 270 kilograms. Therefore, to find M, I can solve for M by multiplying both sides by 4.

So, M = 270 * 4. Let me calculate that. 270 times 4 is 1080. So, M is 1080 kilograms.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the triceratops had 1080 kg, the T-Rex ate half, which is 540 kg, leaving 540 kg. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, which is 270 kg, leaving 270 kg. Then, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg. That adds up. So, yes, 1080 kg is the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops it had. So, if the triceratops had M kg, the T-Rex ate M/2, leaving M/2. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, so (M/2)/2 = M/4. Then, the Allosaurus ate the remaining M/4, which was 270 kg. So, M/4 = 270, so M = 1080. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward problem with multiple steps, each reducing the amount by half. So, the key is to work backwards from the 270 kg to find the original amount before the T-Rex ate.

So, yeah, I think 1080 kilograms is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The triceratops had \boxed{1080} kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate it.

The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. This means the remaining meat is half of what it had. Let \( M \) be the kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. The T-Rex ate half of \( M \), leaving \( \frac{M}{2} \) kg of meat.

Next, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining meat. This means they took \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{M}{2} = \frac{M}{4} \) kg of meat. The meat left after the velociraptors had their meal is \( \frac{M}{2} - \frac{M}{4} = \frac{M}{4} \).

A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. Therefore, \( \frac{M}{4} = 270 \) kg. Solving for
