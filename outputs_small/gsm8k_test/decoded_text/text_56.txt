Q: Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money Peter spends each time he goes to the movies. He spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, which totals $14 per visit.

Next, I'll divide his total budget of $42 by the cost per visit of $14 to find out how many times he can go to the movies.

Finally, by performing the division, I find that Peter can go to the movies 3 times within his budget.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost per movie visit:**
   - **Ticket cost:** \$7
   - **Popcorn cost:** \$7
   - **Total cost per visit:** \$7 + \$7 = **\$14**

2. **Calculate the number of movie visits Peter can afford:**
   - **Total budget:** \$42
   - **Number of visits:** \$42 ÷ \$14 = **3**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{3}
