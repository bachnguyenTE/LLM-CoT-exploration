Q: James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  He gets 1 hour free.  The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost.  How much did he pay?

Okay, so James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. That's a total of 4 hours, right? Because from 5 to 6 is one hour, 6 to 7 is another, 7 to 8, and 8 to 9. So that's 4 hours in total.

He gets 1 hour free. Hmm, so does that mean he only paid for 3 hours? Because 4 total hours minus 1 free hour equals 3 paid hours. Let me make sure that's correct. So, if he hires from 5 PM to 9 PM, that's 4 hours. If he gets 1 hour free, he only has to pay for 3 hours. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the first paid hour is $15. Wait, hold on, the question says $15? Let me check. It says, "He gets 1 hour free. The first paid hour is $15 and each hour after that is twice the cost." So, the first hour is $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous one. So, the first hour is $15, the second is $30, the third is $60, and so on.

Wait, so the first hour is $15, and each next hour is double the previous one. So, let me break it down. The first hour is $15. Then, the second hour is 2 times $15, which is $30. The third hour is 2 times $30, which is $60. The fourth hour would be 2 times $60, which is $120. But wait, he only paid for 3 hours, right? Because he got 1 hour free.

So, let me list out the hours he paid for:

1st hour: $15

2nd hour: $30

3rd hour: $60

So, adding those up: $15 + $30 is $45, plus $60 is $105. So, total amount he paid is $105.

Wait, let me double-check. Total time is 4 hours, he gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, each subsequent hour is double the previous. So, first is 15, second is 30, third is 60. So, 15 + 30 is 45, plus 60 is 105. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as a geometric series. The first term is 15, and each term is multiplied by 2. So, the sum of the first three terms would be 15 + 30 + 60. Let me compute that: 15 + 30 is 45, plus 60 is 105. So, same result.

Wait, but hold on, is the first hour $15, and each subsequent hour is twice the cost. So, the first is 15, second is 30, third is 60, fourth would be 120, but he didn't pay for that one. So, yeah, 15 + 30 + 60 is 105.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the cost per hour. First hour is $15, then each next hour is double. So, the first is 15, second is 30, third is 60, fourth is 120. So, he paid for 3 hours, so 15 + 30 + 60 is 105.

Wait, but let me make sure that the first hour is $15, and each subsequent is double. So, the first is 15, second is 30, third is 60, fourth is 120. So, yeah, 15 + 30 + 60 is 105.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the cost per hour as a sequence where each term is double the previous. So, first term is 15, second term is 30, third term is 60, fourth term is 120. So, the total he paid is 15 + 30 + 60, which is 105.

Wait, but hold on, is the first hour $15 or $15? The question says, "The first paid hour is $15." So, yeah, first is 15, second is 30, third is 60, fourth is 120. So, 15 + 30 +60 is
