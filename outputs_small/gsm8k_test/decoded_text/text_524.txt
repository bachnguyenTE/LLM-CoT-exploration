Q: Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. If Jackson buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, how many rows of flowers will he plant?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in each row. So, I divide the total number of red tulips by the number per row: 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows.

Next, I'll calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips. Jackson has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in each row. Dividing the total blue tulips by the number per row gives: 24 ÷8 =3 rows.

Finally, to find the total number of rows, I add the number of red and blue rows together: 6 +3 =9 rows.

**Solution:**

Jackson is planting tulips in rows, with specific numbers of red and blue tulips per row. To find the total number of rows, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rows for red tulips:**
   - **Total red tulips:** 36
   - **Red tulips per row:** 6
   - **Number of rows:** \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows

2. **Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips:**
   - **Total blue tulips:** 24
   - **Blue tulips per row:** 8
   - **Number of rows:** \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows

3. **Find the total number of rows:**
   - **Total rows:** \( 6 \text{ (red)} + 3 \text{ (blue)} = 9 \text{ rows} \)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{9}
