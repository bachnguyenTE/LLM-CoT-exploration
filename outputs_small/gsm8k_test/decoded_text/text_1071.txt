Q: Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. How much will the party cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of people invited to the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members, which adds up to 45 people. However, 4 people couldn't attend, so the total number of attendees is 41.

Next, I'll calculate the additional guests beyond the initial 20. There are 41 attendees minus the 20 who were already accounted for, resulting in 19 additional guests.

The base rental fee for the theater is $125. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, there's an extra $6 charge. Since there are 19 additional guests, the extra cost is 19 multiplied by $6, which equals $1114.

Finally, I'll add the base fee of $125 to the extra cost of $114 to find the total party cost. This gives a total of $239.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much the party will cost.

### **Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Guests Invited**

- **Kayla's classmates:** 25
- **Girls in her dance class:** 7
- **Family members:** 13

**Total Invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45**

### **Step 2: Subtract the Number of People Who Could Not Attend**

- **People who couldn't come:** 4

**Total Attendees = 45 - 4 = 41**

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost**

- **Base rental fee:** \$125
- **Cost per additional guest beyond the first 20:** \$6

**Number of Additional Guests = 41 - 22 = 19**

**Total Cost = Base Fee + (Additional Guests × Cost per Guest)**

**Total Cost = \$125 + (19 × \$6) = \$125 + \$114 = \$239**

### **Final Answer**

\boxed{239}
