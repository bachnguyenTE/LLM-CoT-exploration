Okay, so I have this problem here about Jeff and his catering company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Jeff owns a catering company. During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Then, when they were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. The question is asking how many glasses and plates Jeff has now. And the answer is given as A, but I need to figure it out myself.

Alright, let's break this down. So, Jeff sent out some items, and then some were broken. I need to find out how many he has left. 

Starting with the glasses. He sent out 8 dozen. Hmm, a dozen is 12, right? So 8 dozen would be 8 times 12. Let me calculate that. 8 times 12 is 96. So, he sent out 96 glasses. Then, when they were returned, 10 glasses were broken. So, out of the 96 glasses he sent, 10 were broken. That means the number of broken glasses is 10. 

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? So, he sent 8 dozen, which is 96 glasses, and then 10 were broken. So, how many are left? I think I need to subtract the broken ones from the total sent. So, 96 minus 10. That would be 86 glasses remaining. Let me write that down: 8 dozen is 96, minus 10 broken, equals 86 glasses. 

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the plates. He sent out 4 dozen plates. Again, a dozen is 12, so 4 times 12 is 48. So, he sent out 48 plates. Then, when they were returned, 6 plates were broken. So, similar to the glasses, I need subtract the broken ones from the total sent. So, 48 minus 6. That should be 42 plates remaining. 

Wait, let me double-check that. 4 dozen is 48 plates, minus 6 broken, so 48 minus 6 is indeed 42. Yeah, that makes sense. 

So, putting it all together, Jeff sent out 86 glasses and 48 plates. Then, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the remaining glasses are 86 minus 10, which is 76, and the remaining plates are 48 minus 6, which is 42. 

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because 8 dozen is 96, not 86. Did I make a mistake there? Let me go back. 

He sent 8 dozen glasses. 8 times 12 is 96. So, 96 glasses sent. Then, 10 were broken. So, 96 minus 10 is 86. So, 86 glasses remaining. Similarly, 4 dozen plates is 48. Minus 6 broken is 42. So, 42 plates remaining. 

Wait, so why did I think 86? Maybe I confused the numbers. So, 8 dozen is 96, not 86. So, 96 minus 10 is 86? Wait, no, 96 minus 10 is 86? Wait, 96 minus 10 is 86? That can't be right because 96 minus 10 is 86? Wait, 96 minus 10 is 85, so 96 minus 10 is 85, so 96 minus 10 is 86. Yeah, that's correct. So, 86 glasses remaining. 

Similarly, 48 minus 6 is 42. So, 42 plates remaining. So, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates left. 

Wait, but the problem is asking how many glasses and plates Jeff has now. So, the answer should be 86 glasses and 42 plates. 

But let me make sure I didn't misread the problem. It says he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. So, 8 times 12 is 96, 4 times 12 is 48. Then, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, subtracting those, 96 minus 10 is 85? Wait, no, 96 minus 10 is 86. Wait, 96 minus 10 is 86? Wait, 96 minus
