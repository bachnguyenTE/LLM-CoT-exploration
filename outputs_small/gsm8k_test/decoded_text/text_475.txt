Q: It takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes. Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks. If he can walk 4 days a week to break in the new shoes, how long does he have to spend walking each day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total time Jason needs to walk to break in the new shoes, which is 240 minutes.

Next, I'll calculate how many days he can walk in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks amount to 21 days.

Now, I'll divide the total walking time by the number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day. 

Finally, I'll present the result in a clear and concise manner.

**Solution:**

To determine how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day to break in the new shoes, follow these steps:

1. **Total Walking Time:**
   - **Total minutes to break in shoes:** 240 minutes

2. **Number of Days He Can Walk:**
   - **Days per week:** 4 days
   - **Number of weeks:** 3 weeks
   - **Total days:** \( 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \)

3. **Minutes to Walk Each Day:**
   - **Minutes per day:** \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \)

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20 \text{ minutes/day}}
\]
