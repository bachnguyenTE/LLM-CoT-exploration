Q: A phone tree is used to contact families and relatives of Ali's deceased coworker. Ali decided to call 3 families. Then each family calls 3 other families, and so on. How many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls?

Okay, so I have this problem about a phone tree where Ali calls 3 families, and each family calls 3 others, and so on. I need to figure out how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me try to visualize what's happening here. It sounds like a chain reaction where each call leads to another call. So, it's like a geometric progression or something similar. Maybe I can model this with some kind of sequence or series.

Let me break it down step by step. The first round is when Ali calls 3 families. So, that's the first round. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 others. So, the second round would be 3 times 3, which is 9 families. Then, each of those 9 families calls 3 others, so the third round would be 9 times 3, which is 27 families. Following that, the fourth round would be 27 times 3, which is 81 families.

Wait, so each round is multiplying the number of families by 3. So, the number of families notified in each round is 3, 9, 27, 81, and so on. So, the first round is 3, second is 9, third is 27, fourth is 81. So, the question is asking for the number during the fourth round, which would be 81.

But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes these problems can be tricky because they might be asking for the total number up to the fourth round, not just the fourth round itself. But the question specifically says "during the fourth round of calls," so I think it's just the number in the fourth round, not the cumulative total.

But just to double-check, let me think about the process. Ali calls 3 families in the first round. Then each of those 3 calls 3 others, so 3*3=9 in the second round. Then each of those 9 calls 3 others, so 9*3=27 in the third round. Then each of those 27 calls 3 others, so 27*3=81 in the fourth round. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a tree, each round branches out by 3 times the previous number. So, the number of families in each round is 3, 9, 27, 81, etc. So, the fourth round is 81.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the rounds. The first round is Ali calling 3 families. So, that's the first round. Then, each of those 3 calls 3 others, so that's the second round. Then, each of those 9 calls 3 others, that's the third round. Then, each of those 27 calls 3 others, that's the fourth round. So, yes, 81 is the number of families notified during the fourth round.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3, starting from 3. So, the first term is 3, second term is 9, third term is 27, fourth term is 81. So, yeah, 81 is the fourth term.

But just to be thorough, let me write it out step by step:

Round 1: Ali calls 3 families. So, 3 families notified.

Round 2: Each of the 3 families calls 3 others. So, 3*3=9 families notified.

Round 3: Each of the 9 families calls 3 others. So, 9*3=27 families notified.

Round 4: Each of the 27 families calls 3 others. So, 27*3=81 families notified.

So, yes, 81 is the number of families notified during the fourth round.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is the number of families notified in each round the same as the number of calls? Or is it the number of new families being called?

Wait, in the first round, Ali calls 3 families, so 3 new families are notified. Then, each of those 3 calls 3 others, so 9 new families are notified in the second round. Then, each of those 9 calls 3 others, so 27 new families in the third round. Then, each of those 27 calls 3 others, so 81 new families in the fourth round.

So, each round is the number of new families being notified, not the total number. So, the total number of families notified after four rounds would be 3 + 9 + 27 +
