Q: Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about two people, Betsy and Donovan, working together to make a meal. The total time they took was 98 minutes. Importantly, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. So, I need to find out how long Betsy's part was.

Let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where we have two people working together, each contributing a part of the meal, and the total time is the sum of their individual times. So, if I let Betsy's time be one variable and Donovan's time be another, I can set up an equation.

Let me denote the time Betsy took as B minutes. Then, since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, that means Donovan's time would be B minus 18 minutes. Wait, hold on, is that right? If Betsy took 18 minutes longer, then Betsy's time is greater than Donovan's. So, if I let B be Betsy's time, then B = D + 18, where D is the time Donovan took. So, D = B - 18.

Alternatively, I could let D be the time Betsy took, so then B = D + 18. Either way, it's the same relationship. So, I can set up an equation where the sum of Betsy's time and Donovan's time equals 98 minutes.

So, if I let D be the time Betsy took, then B = D + 18. So, the total time is D + B = 98. Substituting B, we get D + (D +18) = 98. So, that simplifies to 2D +18 =98. Then, subtract 18 from both sides: 2D = 80. Then, divide both sides by 2: D =40. So, Betsy took 40 minutes.

Wait, let me check that again. If Betsy took 40 minutes, then Donovan took 40 -18 =32 minutes. Then, 40 +32 =72 minutes, which is not 98. Wait, that can't be right. So, I must have made a mistake in my setup.

Wait, hold on, maybe I got the relationship backwards. If Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, then Betsy's time is longer. So, if I let B be Betsy's time, then B = D +18. So, the total time is B + D =98. So, substituting, (D +18) + D =98. So, 2D +18=98. Then, 2D=80, so D=40. Then, B=40 +18=58. So, Betsy took 58 minutes, and Donovan took 40 minutes. 58 +40=98. That adds up. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to set D as Betsy's time, I got confused. So, let me clarify. Let me define variables clearly.

Let me denote B as Betsy's time, and D as Donovan's time. The problem says Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. So, B = D +18. The total time is 98 minutes, so B + D =98.

So, substituting, (D +18) + D =98. So, 2D +18=98. Then, subtract 18: 2D=80. Then, D=40. So, B=40 +18=58. So, Betsy's part was 58 minutes.

Wait, so earlier when I tried to set D as Betsy's time, I had D + (D -18)=98, which would be 2D -8=98, so 2D=106, D=58, which is the same as B. So, that's consistent. So, whether I set B as Betsy's time or D as Betsy's time, I get the same result. So, Betsy's time is 58 minutes.

Wait, but in my first attempt, I thought that if Betsy took 18 minutes longer, then B
