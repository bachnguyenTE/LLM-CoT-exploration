Q: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?

Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then, for the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to do some assignments. After that, for the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. I need to find out how many hours she slept in total throughout the week.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let's figure out how much she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours. That's straightforward.

Then, for Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day. So, if she slept 8 hours on Monday, then on Tuesday she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours. Similarly, on Wednesday, she also slept 6 hours because it's the same amount less.

So, let me write that down:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours

Now, the rest of the week. The week has 7 days, so after Monday and Tuesday, that's 2 days, so the rest of the week is 7 - 2 = 5 days. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the problem says "the rest of the week." So, if she slept 1 hour more than those two days, does that mean for the remaining 5 days, she slept 1 hour more than the two days she slept 6 hours?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?"

So, the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) she slept 2 hours less than Monday. So, each of those days was 6 hours. Then, for the rest of the week, which would be the remaining 5 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and... wait, hold on, let's count: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So, if she slept 2 hours less on Tuesday and Wednesday, then the rest of the week is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, which is 4 days.

Wait, so the problem says: "the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days." So, those two days were Tuesday and Wednesday, each 6 hours. So, the rest of the week is 4 days, and each of those days she slept 1 hour more than 6 hours. So, 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day.

So, let me structure this:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

So, now I need to add all these up to get the total hours.

Let me add them step by step.

First, Monday: 8

Then, Tuesday and Wednesday: 6 + 6 = 12

Then, Thursday to Sunday: 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28

So, total hours: 8 + 12 +28

Wait, 8 +12 is 20, and 20 +28 is 28.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check again.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 8 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) +6 (Wednesday) +7 (Thursday) +7 (Friday) +7 (Saturday) +7 (Sunday). So, that's 8 +6 +6 +7 +7 +7 +7.

Let me add them in order:

8 +6 =14

14 +6=20

20 +7=27

27 +7=34

34 +7=41

41 +7=48

Wait, that's 48 hours total? That seems low, but let me verify.

Wait, 8 on Monday, 6 on Tuesday, 6 on Wednesday, 7 on Thursday, 7 on Friday, 7 on Saturday, 7 on Sunday.

So, 8 +6 +6 +7 +7 +7 +7.

Let me add them in pairs:

8 +6=14

6 +7=13

7 +7=14

7 +7=14

Wait, that's not the right way. Maybe I should add them all up:

8 +6=14

14 +6=20

20 +7=27

27 +7=34

34 +7=41

41 +7=4
