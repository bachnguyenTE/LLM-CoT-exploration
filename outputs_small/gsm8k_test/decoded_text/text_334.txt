Q: Nick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where four people—Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ—each have paintball guns. The numbers are: DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10, RJ has 1, and Richard has 5. The question is asking, if they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It says they are sharing their guns equally. So, I think that means we need to combine all their guns together and then divide them equally among the four of them. That makes sense because if they're sharing equally, each person should end up with the same number of guns.

Alright, so let me list out how many guns each person has:

- DJ: 8 guns
- Nick: 10 guns
- Richard: 5 guns
- Richard: Wait, hold on, the problem says Richard has 5 guns, but then it says "RJ" in the list. Is that a typo? Because RJ is a person, so maybe it should be Richard? Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back, the problem says: "Nick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns." Hmm, so it's written as "RJ" instead of "Richard." That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be Richard. Because otherwise, we have two people named Richard, which doesn't make sense. So, I think it's a mistake, and it should be Richard. So, Richard has 5 guns.

So, to clarify, the numbers are:

- DJ: 8
- Nick: 10
- Richard: 5
- Jason: 1

Wait, hold on, the original problem says: "RJ has 1 gun." So, is that a typo? Because if it's RJ, then it's a person, not a gun. So, maybe it's a mistake, and it should be Richard. So, I think I'll proceed with Richard having 5 guns.

So, now, let's list the number of guns each person has:

- DJ: 8
- Nick: 10
- Richard: 5
- Jason: 1

So, that's four people. Now, to find out how many guns each would have if they share equally, I need to add up all the guns and then divide by 4.

Let me calculate the total number of guns first.

So, DJ has 8, Nick has 10, Richard has 5, and Jason has 1. So, adding those together:

8 + 10 = 18

18 + 5 = 13

13 + 1 = 14

Wait, that can't be right. 8 + 10 is 18, plus 5 is 23, plus 1 is 24? Wait, no, 8 + 10 is 18, plus 5 is 13, plus 1 is 14. Wait, hold on, 8 + 10 is 18, plus 5 is 23, plus 1 is 24. Wait, no, 8 + 10 is 18, plus 5 is 23, plus 1 is 24? Wait, no, 8 + 10 is 18, plus 5 is 13, plus 1 is 14. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me do it step by step:

Start with DJ: 8

Add Nick: 8 + 10 = 18

Add Richard: 18 + 5 = 23

Add Jason: 23 +1 = 24

So, total number of guns is 24.

Now, if they are to share equally, we need to divide 24 by 4.

24 divided by 4 is 6.

So, each person would have 6 guns.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, total guns: 8 + 10 +5 +1 = 24. Yes, that's correct.

Divide 24 by 4: 24 ÷ 4 = 6. That's correct.

So, each person would have 6 guns.

But hold on, let me think again. Is there any chance that I misread the number of guns each person has? Let me check the original problem again.
