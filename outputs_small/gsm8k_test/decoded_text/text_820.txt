Okay, so I have this problem here where Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on a particular day. Then, on the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day to Hollock Valley shores. I need to find the total time she took to walk in the two days in minutes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. On the first day, she walked for 8 hours. That seems straightforward. Then, on the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day. So, if she walked 8 hours on the first day, then on the second day, she walked half of that, which would be 4 hours. Is that right? Let me double-check. Half of 8 is indeed 4, so that seems correct.

So, now, I need to find the total time she walked over the two days. That would be the sum of the time she walked on the first day and the time she walked on the second day. So, that would be 8 hours plus 4 hours. Let me add those up. 8 plus 4 is 12. So, in total, she walked for 12 hours over the two days.

But wait, the question asks for the total time in minutes. So, I need to convert 12 hours into minutes. I remember that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, to convert hours to minutes, I multiply the number of hours by 60. Let me write that down.

Total time in hours = 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour.

Hmm, let me compute that. 12 multiplied by 60. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 10 multiplied by 60 is 600, and 2 multiplied by 60 is 120. So, adding those together, 600 + 120 is 720. So, 12 hours is equal to 720 minutes.

Wait, let me verify that. 60 minutes times 12 is 60, so 60 times 12 is 120, so 60 times 12 is 120, so 60 times 12 is 120. So, 60 times 12 is 120, so 60 times 12 is 120. So, 60 times 12 is 120, so 60 times 12 is 120. So, 60 times 12 is 720. Yeah, that seems right.

So, putting it all together, Sandy walked for a total of of 720 minutes over the two days.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 8 hours on the first day, 4 hours on the second day, so 8 + 4 is 12 hours. 12 hours times 60 minutes per hour. 12 times 60. Let me compute that again. 10 times 60 is 600, 2 times 60 is 120, so 600 + 120 is 720. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 12 hours as 1 hour and 60 minutes, so 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 12 hours is 12*60. Let me compute 12*60. 10*60 is 660, and 1*60 is 60, so 660 + 60 is 726. Wait, that's different. Wait, no, 12*60 is 720, right? Because 10*60 is 660, 11*60 is 60, so 660 + 60 is 726. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 12*60 is 720, right? Because 10*60 is 660, 2*60 is 120, so 660 + 60 is 726? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 12*60 is 720. Wait, 10*60 is 600, 2*60 is 120, so 600 + 120 is 7
