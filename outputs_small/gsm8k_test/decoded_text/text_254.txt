Q: Shelly's 3 kids spent all day at the water park.  Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel and Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.  How many times did Robert go down the water slide?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Shelly's three kids going down the water slide at water park. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Shelly's three kids spent the whole day at the water park. That part seems straightforward, but I guess it's just setting the scene. The main focus is on the number of times each kid went down the slide.

It goes on: "Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times." Okay, so that's straightforward. So, I can note that down. Let me write that down:

- Mitchell: 30 times.

Then, it says, "Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel." Hmm, okay. So, Anne went down fewer times than Mitchell. To find out how many times Anne went down, I need to calculate 30% less than 30. 

Wait, let me make sure I understand percentages correctly. If someone goes down 30% less, that means they went down 30% fewer times than Mitchell. So, it's like subtracting 30% of Mitchell's total from Mitchell's total. 

So, first, I need to find 30% of 30. Let me compute that. 30% of 30 is equal to 0.30 multiplied by 30. Let me calculate that:

0.30 * 30 = ?

Wait, 0.30 is the same as 30%, right? So, 30% of 30 is 0.30 * 30. Let me compute that:

30 * 0.30 = 9. So, 30% of 30 is 9.

Therefore, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchell, which is 30 times minus 9 times. So, 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. If 30% of 30 is 9, then subtracting that from 30 gives 21. Yeah, that seems right. So, Anne went down 21 times.

Then, the problem says, "Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne." So, Robert went down 4 times the number of times Anne went down. So, if Anne went down 21 times, then Robert went down 4 * 21.

Let me compute that: 4 * 21. 4*20 is 80, and 4*1 is 4, so 80 + 4 = 84. So, Robert went down 84 times.

Wait, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Mitchell: 30 times.

2. Anne: 30% less than Mitchell. So, 30 - (30% of 30) = 30 - 9 = 21.

3. Robert: 4 times Anne's number. So, 4 * 21 = 84.

That seems correct. So, Robert went down 84 times.

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If Anne went down 30% less, that's 70% of Mitchell's times. So, 70% of 30 is 0.70 * 30 = 21. So, that's consistent with what I had before.

Then, Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, so 4 * 21 = 84. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of fractions, 30% is 3/10, so 30% is 3/10. So, 30% of 30 is (3/10)*33 = 9.9, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, 9. So, 30 - 9 = 21. Then, 4 times 21 is 84. So, same result.

I think that's solid. So, Robert went down 84 times.

**Final Answer**
The number of times Robert went down the water slide is \boxed{84}.

Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchell. To find the number of times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[
0.30 \times 30 = 9
\]
\[
30 - 9 = 21
\]

So, Anne went down the slide
