Q: A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Okay, so I have this problem about a wooden bridge that can carry no more than 5000 pounds. There's a delivery truck that's going to carry identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. I need to figure out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the given information. The bridge can hold up to 5000 pounds. The truck, when empty, plus the driver, weighs 3755 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, the total weight the truck can carry is 5000 minus the weight of the driver and empty truck. That makes sense because the bridge's limit is the maximum combined weight.

So, let me write that down:

Maximum bridge weight = 5000 pounds

Weight of driver + empty truck = 3755 pounds

Therefore, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is 5000 - 3755. Let me calculate that.

5000 minus 3755. Hmm, 5000 minus 3755. Let me subtract:

5000 - 3755. Let's do this step by step.

5000 minus 3000 is 2000, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 5000 minus 3755.

Let me write it vertically:

  5000
- 3755
--------

Starting from the right:

0 - 5: Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 0, so I need to go to the hundreds place. The hundreds place is also 0, so I have to go to the thousands place. The thousands place is 5, so borrow 1 from there, making it 4, and the hundreds place becomes 10. Then, borrow 1 from the hundreds place for the tens place, making it 9, and the tens place becomes 10. Then, borrow 1 from the tens place for the units place, making it 9, and the units place becomes 10.

So, now we have:

  4 9 9 10
- 3 7 5 5
----------

Subtracting units place: 10 - 5 = 5

Tens place: 9 - 5 = 4

Hundreds place: 9 - 7 = 2

Thousands place: 4 - 3 = 1

So, the result is 1245 pounds. So, the truck can carry 1245 pounds of of boxes.

Each box is 15 pounds. So, to find the maximum number of boxes, I need to divide 1245 by 15.

Let me compute 1245 ÷ 15.

15 goes into 1245 how many times?

15 x 80 = 1200

1245 - 1200 = 45

15 goes into 45 exactly 3 times.

So, 80 + 3 = 83.

Therefore, 1245 ÷ 15 = 83.

So, the maximum number of boxes is 83.

Wait, let me double-check that.

15 x 83: 15 x 80 is 1200, plus 15 x 3 is 45, so 1200 + 45 = 1245. Yes, that's correct.

So, 83 boxes would weigh 1245 pounds, which added to the 3755 pounds of the driver and empty truck, gives 3755 + 1245 = 5000 pounds, which is exactly the bridge's limit. So, that's the maximum number of boxes.

Wait, but the question says "not exceeding the bridge's weight limit." So, 5000 is the maximum, so 5000 is the limit. So, 3755 + 1245 = 5000, which is exactly the limit. So, that's the maximum number of boxes.

Therefore, the answer is 83.

But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

First, 5000 - 3755. Let me compute 5000 - 3755.

5000 - 3000 is 2000.

2000 - 75
