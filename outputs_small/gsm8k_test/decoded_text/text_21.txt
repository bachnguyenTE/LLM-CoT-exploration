Q: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Raymond and Samantha, who are cousins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Hmm, okay, so if I can figure out when Samantha was born, I can add 6 years to that to find out when Raymond was born. 

Next, it mentions that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, that means when the son was 23, Raymond was 23 + 6 = 29 years old. Because he was born 6 years before Samantha. 

Now, the problem also states that Samantha is now 31. So, if I can find out how many years have passed since Samantha was born, I can figure out how many years ago the son was born. 

Let me write down what I know:

- Samantha is now 31.
- So, the number of years since Samantha was born is 31 - 0 = 31 years. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. If she's 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. Yeah, that's right. So, 31 years ago, Samantha was born.

Since Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha, that means 6 years ago, Raymond was born. So, if Samantha was born 31 years ago, then 6 years after that would be 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. So, 6 years after that would be 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago? Wait, no, 31 - 6 is 25, so 25 years ago. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me think again. If Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. So, 6 years after that would be 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago. So, the answer is 25 years ago.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the timeline. So, if Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. So, 6 years after that would be 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago? Wait, no, 31 - 6 is 25, so 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago.

Wait, but the question is asking "how many years ago was Raymond's son born?" So, if the son was born 25 years ago, then the answer is 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago.

But let me think about the ages. If the son is 23 when he was born, and he was 23 when he was born, so he was born in 2008 - 1985 = 23 years ago. Wait, but that's if he's 23 now. But in this case, the son is 23 when he was born, so he was born 23 years ago. But wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer.

Wait, hold on, maybe I'm confusing the current ages. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says that Samantha is now 31. So, if she is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. So, 6 years after that would be 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. So, the son was born 25 years ago.

But the son is 23 when he was born, so if he was born 25 years ago, he would be 28 now, which contradicts the given information that he is 23 now. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the timeline. Let me try again.

If the son is 23 when he was born, that means he was born 23 years ago. But if he was born 6 years after Samantha, then Samantha was born 6 years after the son. So, if the son is 23 now, Samantha is 23 + 6 = 29 now. But the problem says Samantha is 31 now. So, that's a problem.

Wait, so if the son is 23 now, and he was born 6 years after Samantha, then Samantha is 23 + 6 = 29 now. But the problem says
