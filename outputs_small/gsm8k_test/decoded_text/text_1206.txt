Okay, so I have this problem here where John is getting a loan by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,0000. Hmm, wait, that seems like a typo. Let me check. It says $250,000. Oh, maybe it's $250,000? That makes more sense because $250,000 would be $250,000, which is $250,000. Yeah, I think that's the correct way to write it. So, his house is worth $250,000, which is $250,000. Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, it's written as $250,000. Maybe it's $250,000, which is $250,000. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me just go with $250,000, which is $250,000. Wait, that's still confusing. Maybe it's $250,000, which is $250,000. I think I'll just go with $250,000, which is $250,000. Okay, so his house is worth $250,000.

He gets a loan worth 40% of that. Wait, 40%? That seems a bit low. Maybe it's 40%? Yeah, that makes more sense. So, 40% of $250,000. Let me calculate that. 40% is 0.40 in decimal. So, 0.40 multiplied by 250,000. Let me do that. 0.40 * 250,000. Hmm, 0.4 * 250,000 is 100,000, and 0.00 * 250,000 is 2,500. So, adding those together, 100,000 + 2,500 is 102,500. So, the loan is worth $102,500.

He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. So, 60% of $102,500. Let me calculate that. 0.60 * 102,500. 0.6 * 100,000 is 60,000, and 0.6 * 2,500 is 1,500. So, adding those together, 60,000 + 1,500 is 61,500. So, he uses $61,500 to pay off his debts.

Now, the question is, how much money did he have leftover after paying debt? So, he had a loan worth $102,500, and he used $61,500 to pay off his debts. So, the leftover would be the total loan minus the amount used to pay off debts. So, 102,500 - 61,500. Let me subtract that. 102,500 minus 61,500. 102,500 minus 61,500. Let me do this step by step. 102,500 minus 60,000 is 42,500, and then minus another 1,500 is 42,500 - 1,500. Hmm, 42,500 minus 1,500 is 41,000. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check.

Wait, 102,500 minus 61,500. Let me write it down:

102,500  
-61,500  
= ?

Starting from the right: 0 - 0 = 0  
0 - 0 = 0  
5 - 5 = 0  
2 - 1 = 1  
1 - 6. Hmm, can't do that. So, I need to borrow. So, the 1 in the ten-thousands place becomes 0, and the 1 in the thousands place becomes 11. So, 11 - 6 is 5. Then, the hundreds place: 5 - 5 is 0. The tens place
