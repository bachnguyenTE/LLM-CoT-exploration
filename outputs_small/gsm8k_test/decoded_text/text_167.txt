Q: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to translate the words into mathematical equations. Let me assign variables to their current ages. Let's say B represents Brooke's current age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, that means Seth's current age is 2 times B, so I can write that as S = 2B.

Now, the problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, both Seth and Brooke will be 2 years older. That means in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2, and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of these two ages is 28. So, I can write that as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If I add 2 years to each of their current ages, that should give me the sum of their ages in 2 years. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the equation is (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

But I already know that S is equal to 2B, so maybe I can substitute that into the equation. Let me do that. So, replacing S with 2B in the equation, I get (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, let me simplify that equation. Combine like terms. So, 2B + B is 3B, and 2 + 2 is 4. So, the equation becomes 3B + 4 = 28.

Hmm, okay, now I can solve for B. Let me subtract 4 from both sides. 3B + 4 - 4 = 28 - 4, which simplifies to 3B = 24.

Wait, 28 minus 4 is 24, right? So, 3B = 24. Then, to find B, I divide both sides by 3. So, B = 24 / 3, which is 8. So, B is 8. That means Brooke is currently 8 years old.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, that would be 2 times 8, which is 16. So, Seth is 16 years old.

Let me double-check to make sure that makes sense. If in 2 years, Seth will be 16 + 2 = 18, and Brooke will be 8 + 2 = 10. The sum of their ages in 2 years would be 18 + 10 = 28, which matches the problem statement. So, that seems correct.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my equations. Let me go through it again. I set B as Brooke's current age, so S = 2B. In 2 years, their ages will be S + 2 and B +2, and the sum is 28. So, (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28. Combining like terms: 3B + 4 = 28. Subtract 4: 3B = 24. Divide by 3: B = 8. Then S = 16. That seems right.

I think I did everything correctly. So, the answer is that Seth is 16 years old.

**Final Answer**
Seth is \boxed{16} years old.

Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. This gives us the equation:

\[
(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

\[
3B = 24
\]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[
B = 8
\]

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, his current age is:

\[
2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Thus, Seth is \boxed{16} years old.
