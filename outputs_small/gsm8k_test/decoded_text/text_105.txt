Q: Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do both of them eat together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats. If Amir eats 5 cookies, how many cookies do both of them eat together? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, if Amir eats a certain number of cookies, Cody eats three times that number. Then, it tells me that Amir eats 5 cookies. I need to find out the total number of cookies both of them eat together.

Alright, let's break it down. Let me denote the number of cookies Amir eats as A. According to the problem, A is 5. Now, since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, I can represent the number of cookies Cody eats as 3 times A. So, if I let C represent the number of cookies Cody eats, then C = 3 * A.

Since A is 5, I can substitute that into the equation for C. So, C = 3 * 5. Let me calculate that. 3 multiplied by 5 is 15. Wait, that can't be right. 3 times 5 is 15? No, that's not correct. 3 times 5 is 15? Wait, no, 3 times 5 is 15. Oh, I see, I made a mistake there. 3 times 5 is 15? No, that's not right. 3 times 5 is 15. So, C is 15.

So, Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats 15 cookies. Now, to find the total number of cookies they eat together, I need to add the number of cookies each of them eats. That would be 5 (Amir) plus 15 (Cody). Let me add those together. 5 plus 15 is 20. So, together, they eat 20 cookies.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Amir eats 5, and Cody eats three times that, which is 15, then 5 plus 15 is indeed 20. Wait, hold on, 5 plus 15 is 20? No, 5 plus 15 is 20? Wait, no, 5 plus 15 is 20? Wait, 5 plus 10 is 15, plus 5 is 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, 5 plus 15 is 20. So, together, they eat 20 cookies.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3 times 5 is 15, which is incorrect. So, I need to correct that. 3 times 5 is 15, so that's correct. So, 5 plus 15 is 20. So, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20.

Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, if Amir eats 5, then Cody eats 3 times 5, which is 15. Then, together, 5 plus 15 is 20. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a ratio problem. The ratio of cookies eaten by Cody to Amir is 3:1. So, for every 1 cookie Amir eats, Cody eats 3. So, if Amir eats 5, then each "unit" is 5, so 3 units would be 15. So, that's another way to see it.

So, adding them together, 5 plus 15 is 20. So, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me visualize it. If Amir eats 5 cookies, and then Cody eats three times that, so 5, 10, 15. So, 5, 10, 15. So, altogether, 5 plus 15 is 20. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of equations, let me define variables. Let A be the number of cookies Amir eats, which is 5. Then, C, the number of cookies Cody eats, is 3A. So, C = 3*5 = 15. Wait, hold on, 3*5 is 15? No, 3*5 is 15? No, 3*5 is 15? Wait, no, 3*5 is 15? No, 3*5 is 15? Wait, no, 3*5 is 15? Wait, 3*5 is
