Q: Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday, while Daniel was not able to read any pages today. How many more pages did Denise read more than Daniel?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Denise and Daniel reading a book. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. So, let me write that down:

- Yesterday:
  - Denise: 10 pages
  - Daniel: 13 pages

Today, it says that Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Hmm, okay. So, Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so today he didn't read any pages. That means Daniel read 0 pages today.

Now, for Denise, she read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise must have read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

Let me write that down too:

- Today:
  - Denise: 18 pages
  - Daniel: 0 pages

Now, the question is asking how many more pages did Denise read than Daniel in total. So, I need to calculate the total pages each of them read over the two days and then find the difference.

Let's calculate the total pages for each:

For Denise:
- Yesterday: 10 pages
- Today: 18 pages
- Total: 10 + 18 = 28 pages

For Daniel:
- Yesterday: 13 pages
- Today: 0 pages
- Total: 13 + 0 = 13 pages

Now, to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, I subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:

28 (Denise) - 13 (Daniel) = 15 pages

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Denise: 10 + 18 = 28? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? No, that's not right. 10 + 18 is 18, right? Because 10 + 10 is 20, so 10 + 18 is 18. Wait, no, 10 + 18 is 18? No, 10 + 18 is 18? Wait, 10 + 18 is 18? No, that's not correct. 10 + 18 is 18? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, no, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? No, 10 + 18 is 28? Wait, 10 + 10 is 20, so 10 + 18 is 18. Wait, no, 10 + 18 is 18? No, 10 + 18 is 18? Wait, 10 + 18 is 18? No, 10 + 18 is 18? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 29? Wait, no, 10 + 18 is 28? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? No, 10 + 18 is 28? Wait, 10 + 18 is 18? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? No, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 28? No, 10 + 18 is 28. Wait, 10 + 18 is 18?
