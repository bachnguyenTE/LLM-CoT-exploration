Q: Marin and his neighbor Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. How many apples do they eat in 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy each day. Since each of them eats 4 apples a day, together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples per day.

Next, calculate the total number of apples eaten over 300 days. Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 8 apples/day * 300 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 300 days is 240 apples.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total number of apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy over 300 days.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Marin eats **4 apples** a day.
   - Nancy eats **4 apples** a day.
   
   **Total daily consumption:**
   \[
   4 \text{ apples/day} + 4 \text{ apples/day} = 8 \text{ apples/day}
   \]

2. **Total Consumption Over 330 Days:**
   \[
   8 \text{ apples/day} \times 330 \text{ days} = 2640 \text{ apples}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2640}
\]
