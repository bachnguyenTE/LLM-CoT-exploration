Q: Jayden had $70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance to help him buy a new camera that costs $200. How much more does Jayden need to buy the camera?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Jayden received $70 from selling pictures.

His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45.

Adding these amounts together, Jayden has a total of $115.

The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $185 more to buy the camera.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Amount Jayden received from selling pictures:**
   
   Jayden had \$70 from selling pictures.

2. **Amount Ava gave Jayden:**
   
   Ava gave Jayden half of her \$90 allowance.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount from Ava} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total amount Jayden has:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total} = 70 + 45 = 115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of the new camera:**
   
   The camera costs \$200.

5. **Amount Jayden still needs:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Needed} = 200 - 115 = 85 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{85}
\]
