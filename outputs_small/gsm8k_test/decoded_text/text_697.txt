Q: Great Grandma Jones has three children.  And each of her children has three children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren.  And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.  If all of the family show up at the family reunion, how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Great Grandma Jones and her children, grandchildren, and great grand-babies. It seems like a family tree problem where each generation branches out into three more people. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the information given:

1. Great Grandma Jones has three children. So, that's the first generation.
2. Each of these three children has three children. So, each of the three grandchildren has three great grand-babies. That would be the second generation.
3. Each of these three great grand-babies has three babies. So, each of the three great grand-babies has three great great grand-babies. That would be the third generation.

The question is asking how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss. So, we need to find the total number of great grand-babies in the family.

Let me visualize this as a family tree. Great Grandma Jones is the root. She has three children, so that's generation one. Each of those three children has three children, so that's generation two. Each of those three grandchildren has three children, which would be generation three.

So, we need to calculate the number of individuals in generation three, which are the great grand-babies.

Let me write this out:

- Generation 0 (Great Grandma Jones): 1 person
- Generation 1 (Children): 3 people
- Generation 2 (Great Grandchildren): Each of the 3 children has 3 grandchildren, so 3 x 3 = 9 people
- Generation 3 (Great Grandbabies): Each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies, so 9 x 3 = 27 people

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies is 27.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, starting from Great Grandma Jones, who has three children. Each of those three children has three children, so 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Each of those 9 grandchildren has three children, so 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Yes, that seems right. So, the total number of great grand-babies is 27.

But hold on, let me think again. The question says "how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss." So, does that mean we're counting all the great grand-babies, regardless of their position in the family tree? Or is it just the grandchildren of Great Grandma Jones?

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss." So, it's referring to the grandchildren of Great Grandma Jones, which would be generation two, which is 9 people. But in the problem statement, it says "each of her children has three children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren." So, that's generation two.

Then, "each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies." So, that's generation three.

So, the great grand-babies are generation three, which is 27. So, the answer is 27.

But wait, the problem is presented as a question, and the user is asking for the answer in a box. So, maybe I should write it as 27.

But let me double-check. So, starting from Great Grandma Jones:

- She has 3 children (generation 1)
- Each of those 3 has 3 children (generation 2: 9)
- Each of those 9 has 3 children (generation 3: 27)

So, great grand-babies are generation 3, which is 27.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for all the grandchildren, that would be generation 2, which is 9. But the wording says "great grand-babies," which is a term that usually refers to the grandchildren of the grandchildren, so generation 3.

Therefore, the answer should be 27.

Wait, but 27 is written as 27, so in the box, it should be \boxed{27}.

But just to make sure, let me think about the terminology. Great Grandma Jones is the great-grandmother of the great-grandchildren, who are the great grand-babies. So, great grand-babies are the grandchildren of the grandchildren, which is generation three.

So, yeah, 27 is the correct number.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for all the grandchildren, which are generation two, that would be 9. But the term "great grand-babies" is more specific, referring to the grandchildren of the grandchildren, so 27.

Therefore, I think the answer is 27, which is 27 people.

Wait, but 27
