Q: Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?

Okay, so I have this problem where Artemis is potting flowers with her father. They bought a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, and I need to figure out how many roses they can plant. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably figure out how much soil is used by the sunflowers and carnations. Then, subtract that from the total soil to see how much is left for the roses. That makes sense because the total soil is fixed, so whatever is left after using it for the sunflowers and carnations will be used for the roses.

Alright, so let's start with the sunflowers. They planted 4 of them, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. So, I can calculate the total soil used for sunflowers by multiplying the number of sunflowers by the pounds each needs. That would be 4 times 3. Let me write that down:

Sunflowers: 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.

Okay, so 12 pounds of soil are used for the sunflowers. Now, moving on to the carnations. They planted 10 of them, and each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. So, I need to calculate 10 * 1.5. Hmm, 10 is 10, so 10 * 1.5 is 15 pounds. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 10 is 10, so 10 * 1.5. Let me think. 10 * 1.5 is 15, so 10 *1.5 is 15 pounds. Yeah, that's correct. So, carnations use 15 pounds of soil.

Now, let's add up the soil used for sunflowers and carnations. That would be 12 pounds for sunflowers plus 15 pounds for carnations. So, 12 + 15 is 27 pounds. So, together, sunflowers and carnations use 27 pounds of soil.

The total soil they have is 30 pounds. So, to find out how much is left for roses, I subtract the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total. That would be 30 - 27. Let me calculate that. 30 minus 27 is 13. So, 13 pounds of soil are left for roses.

Now, each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, if they have 13 pounds left, and each rose takes 1 pound, then they can plant 13 roses. That seems straightforward.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, sunflowers: 4 * 3 is 12. Carnations: 10 *1.5 is 15. 12 +15 is 27. 30 -27 is 13. 13 divided by 1 is 13. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the total pounds used and then seeing how many roses can be planted with the remaining. Yeah, that's exactly what I did. So, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, I could think about the total pounds used for all the flowers and then see how many roses can be planted. But since the question specifically asks for the number of roses after planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, just to make sure, let me recast the problem. They have 30 pounds. They use 12 for sunflowers, 15 for carnations, and 13 for roses. 12 +15 is 27, plus 13 is 40. Wait, that can't be right because 30 is the total. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I think I confused the numbers.

Wait, no, 12 +15 is 27, and 30 -27 is 13. So, 13 is the remaining. So, 13 pounds for roses, each rose is 1 pound, so 13 roses. So, that's correct.

Wait, but 12 +15 is 27, and 30 -27 is 6. Wait, no, 30 -27 is 3. Wait, hold on, 30 -27 is 23? Wait, no, 30 minus 27 is 3. Wait, no,
