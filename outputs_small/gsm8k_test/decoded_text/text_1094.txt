Q: Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Okay, so I have this problem about Ellen playing a prank with her sodas, and I need to figure out the probability that her friend gets sprayed with a soda from a shaken can. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them. Then she takes 1 unshaken soda for herself and leaves. After that, her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. Then Ellen's friend comes along, and we need to find the probability that the friend gets a soda from a shaken can.

Alright, let me list out the steps to keep track of the sodas:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them. So, initially, 3 are shaken, and 9 are unshaken.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, unshaken becomes 9 - 1 = 8.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. So, shaken becomes 3 -1 = 2, and unshaken becomes 8 -2 = 6.
5. Then Ellen's friend comes along. We need to find the probability that the friend gets a shaken soda.

Wait, so after these steps, how many sodas are left? Let me calculate that.

Total sodas initially: 12.

After Ellen takes 1 unshaken: 12 -1 =11 soda left? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, she took 1 unshaken, so the total number of sodas is 12 -1 =11? That can't be right because she took 1, so 11 left? But then her brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken, so 12 -1 (Ellen) -1 (brother) -2 (friend) =8 left. Wait, maybe I need to track the number of each type.

Let me try a different approach. Let's track the number of shaken and unshaken sodas separately.

Initially:
- Shaken: 3
- Unshaken:9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken for herself: so now,
- Shaken:3
- Unshaken:9 -1=8

Her brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken:
- Shaken:3 -1=2
- Unshaken:8 -2=6

So now, after her brother takes his share, we have:
- Shaken:2
- Unshaken:6

So, total sodas left:2 +6=8.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. We need to find the probability that the friend gets a shaken soda. So, the number of shaken sodas is 2, and the total number of sodas is8.

Therefore, the probability is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4. Converting that to a percentage, it's 25%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3, so 3 are shaken, 9 are unshaken. Then she takes 1 unshaken for herself, so 8 unshaken left. Her brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken, so shaken becomes 2, unshaken becomes 6. So, total sodas left:8. So, the number of shaken sodas is 2, so the probability is 2/8=1/4=25%.

Wait, but hold on, is the friend taking a soda from the remaining 8? So, the probability is indeed 2/8, which is 25%.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the friend randomly selecting a soda from the remaining 8, and the chance it's shaken is 2/8.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the initial distribution.

Wait, another way: Ellen starts with 12 sodas. 3 are shaken, 9 are unshaken.

She takes 1 unshaken for herself, so 8 unshaken left.

Her brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken, so 2 shaken and 6 unshaken left.

So, the remaining sodas are 2 shaken and 6 unshaken, total 8.

So, the probability that the friend gets a shaken soda is 2/8=25%.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the initial probabilities.

Wait, but the problem says "the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can."

So, the friend is getting a soda
