Q: Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them and gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. If he then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, how much money did he receive?

Okay, so Walter bought 60 apples. Hmm, let me write that down. He ate 2/5 of them. Alright, so first step is to figure out how many apples he ate. 

To find 2/5 of 60, I can calculate 66 multiplied by 2/5. Let me do that: 66 * 2 = 132, and then 132 divided by 5 is... 26.4? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should do it step by step. 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, and then multiplied by 2 is 26.4. Hmm, okay, so he ate 26.4 apples. But wait, apples can't be in fractions, right? So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, so 2/5 of 66 is 26.4. Hmm, that's a decimal. Maybe I should convert 66 into a fraction to make it easier. 66 is the same as 66/1. So, 2/5 of 66/1 is (2*66)/(5*1) = 12/5, which is 2.4. Wait, that's different. Wait, 2/5 of 66 is 26.4? No, wait, 2/5 of 66 is 26.4? Wait, no, 2/5 of 66 is 26.4? Wait, 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, times 2 is 26.4. So, 26.4 apples. Hmm, but that's a decimal. Maybe I should keep it as a fraction.

Wait, 66 is 66, so 2/5 of 66 is (2*66)/5 = 12/5, which is 2 and 2/5, which is 2.4. So, 2.4 apples. So, he ate 2.4 apples. Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. So, after eating 2.4, he has 66 - 2.4 = 63.6 apples left. Then, he gave his sister 25% of 63.6. 25% is the same as 1/4, so 63.6 divided by 4 is... 1.65. So, he gave his sister 1.65 apples.

So, now he has 63.6 - 1.65 = 61.95 apples left. Then, he sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. So, 61.95 apples times $3 each. Let me calculate that: 61.95 * 3. 60*3 is 180, 1.95*3 is 5.85, so total is 180 + 5.85 = 185.85. So, he received $185.85.

Wait, but that seems like a lot of money. Let me check my steps again. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

First, he bought 66 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. So, 2/5 of 66 is 26.4. So, he ate 26.4 apples. Then, he had 66 - 26.4 = 39.6 apples left. Then, he gave his sister 25% of 39.6, which is 9.9. So, he gave his sister 9.9 apples. Then, he had 39.6 - 9.9 = 29.7 apples left. Then, he sold 29.7 apples at $3 each, so 29.7 * 3 = 89.1. Wait, that's different. So, which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should convert 66 into a fraction. 66 is 66/1. 2/5 of that is (2/5)*(66/1) = 132/5 = 26.4. So, he ate 26.4 apples. Then, remaining is 66 - 26.4 = 39.6. Then, he gave his sister 25% of 39.6, which is 9.9. So
