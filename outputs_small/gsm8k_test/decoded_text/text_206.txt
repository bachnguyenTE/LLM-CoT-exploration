Q: Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many kilometers Michael did in total. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Michael loves riding his bike. He rides it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks. Then, he decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. The question is asking for the total kilometers he did.

Alright, so let me parse this information. There are two different riding periods for Michael. The first period is 5 times a week for 25 km each time, and this happened over 4 weeks. The second period is 2 times a week for 66 km each time, and this happened over 3 weeks. I need to calculate the total distance for each period and then add them together.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the total distance for the first period.
2. Calculate the total distance for the second period.
3. Add both totals to get the overall total distance.

Starting with the first period: 5 times a week for 25 km each time, over 4 weeks.

So, each week, he rides 5 times, each time 25 km. So, per week, the distance is 5 * 25 km. Let me compute that.

5 * 25 = 125 km per week.

He did this for 4 weeks, so total distance for the first period is 125 km/week * 4 weeks.

125 * 4 = 500 km.

Okay, so that's 500 km for the first four weeks.

Now, moving on to the second period: he decided to ride only 2 times a week, but for 66 km each time, and he did that for 3 weeks.

So, per week, he rides 2 times, each time 66 km. So, per week, the distance is 2 * 66 km.

2 * 66 = 132 km per week.

He did this for 3 weeks, so total distance for the second period is 132 km/week * 3 weeks.

132 * 3. Let me compute that.

132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=0, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 0 + 6 = 306 km.

Wait, hold on, 132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 90 + 6 = 400 + 6 = 406? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 90 + 6 = 396. Wait, 300 + 90 is 390, plus 6 is 396. So, 132 * 3 = 396 km.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate 132 * 3.

132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 90 is 390, plus 6 is 396. So, 132 * 3 = 396? Wait, no, 132 * 3 is 396. Wait, 132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 90 is 390, plus 6 is 396. So, 132 * 3 = 396. So, 396 km.

Wait, but 132 * 3: 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 330 + 6=336? Wait, no, 100*3=300, 30*3=90, 2*3=6. So, 300 + 90 is 390, plus 6 is 396
