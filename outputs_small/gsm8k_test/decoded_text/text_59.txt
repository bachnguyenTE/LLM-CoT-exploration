Q: A raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each and 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush. How many raspberries are there total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of fruit in the raspberry bush. The bush has 6 clusters, each containing 20 fruits. To find the total number of fruits in the clusters, I multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruits per cluster.

Next, I add the 67 individual fruits that are scattered across the bush to the total number of fruits from the clusters.

Finally, the sum of the fruits in the clusters and the scattered fruits will give me the total number of raspberries in the bush.

To determine the total number of raspberries in the raspberry bush, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of fruits in the clusters:**
   
   - Each cluster contains **20 fruits**.
   - There are **6 clusters**.
   
   \[
   \text{Fruits in clusters} = 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ fruits/cluster} = 120 \text{ fruits}
   \]

2. **Add the scattered fruits:**
   
   - There are **67 individual fruits** scattered across the bush.
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Fruits in clusters} + \text{Scattered fruits} = 120 + 67 = 187 \text{ fruits}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of raspberries:**
   
   - Each **fruit** is a raspberry.
   
   \[
   \text{Total raspberries} = 187
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{187}
\]
