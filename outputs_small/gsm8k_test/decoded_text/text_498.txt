Q: Brianne and Ashley make greek orange pie. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, while Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. If one greek orange pie needs three oranges, how many greek orange pies can they make?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make together. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's see how many oranges Ashley brought. The problem says she brought five boxes, and each box has ten oranges. So, to find the total number of oranges Ashley has, I can multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box. That would be 5 boxes multiplied by 10 oranges per box. Let me write that down:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Alright, so Ashley has 50 oranges. Now, Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Hmm, so I need to add 22 to the number of oranges Ashley has. Let me calculate that:

50 oranges (Ashley's) + 22 oranges = 72 oranges.

So, Brianne has 72 oranges. Now, to find the total number of oranges they have together, I need to add Ashley's oranges and Brianne's oranges:

50 oranges + 72 oranges = 122 oranges.

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. 50 plus 72 is actually 122? Let me double-check that addition. 50 plus 70 is 127, and then plus 2 is 129. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:

50 (Ashley) + 72 (Brianne) = 122. Wait, no, 50 + 72 is 122? Hmm, 50 + 70 is 120, and then +2 is 122. Yeah, that's correct. So together, they have 122 oranges.

Now, each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. So, to find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie. That would be:

122 oranges / 3 oranges per pie.

Let me do that division. 3 goes into 12 four times, so 4 pies would use 12 oranges. Subtract 12 from 12, you get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 2. 3 goes into 2 zero times, so we write 0. Then, bring down the next digit, which is 2 again. 3 goes into 2 zero times, so we write another 0. Wait, this seems like it's going to be a repeating decimal. Let me write it out properly.

122 divided by 3:

3 | 122
First, 3 goes into 1 zero times, so we consider 12. 3 goes into 12 four times. 4*3 is 12. Subtract 12 from 12, we get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 2. 3 goes into 2 zero times, so we write 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 2 again. 3 goes into 2 zero times, so we write another 0. Hmm, so it's 40.666... or 40.666...? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, 122 divided by 3. Let me do it step by step:

3 into 1 is 0, so we take 12. 3 into 12 is 4. 4*3 is 12. Subtract 12 from 12, we get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 2. 3 into 2 is 0. So, we write 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 2 again. 3 into 2 is 0. So, we write another 0. So, it's 40.6666... or 40.6 recurring.

But since you can't have a fraction of a pie, we need to take the whole number part. So, 40 pies? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3*40 is 108. 122 minus 108 is 14. So, 46 pies would be 138 oranges, which is more than 122. So, 46 pies would be 138, which is too much. So, 46 is too much, 45 is 135, which is still too much. 44 is 132, which is still too much. 43 is 129, which is still too much. 42 is 126, still too much.
