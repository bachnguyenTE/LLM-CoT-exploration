Q: Bob spends $27000 distributed between 3 schools to buy books.  He can buy 100 books for $500.  How many books can he buy per school?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Bob is spending $27,000 on books for three schools. Hmm, wait, that's a typo, I think. It should probably be $27,000, right? Because $27,000 doesn't make much sense. So, he's distributing $27,000 between three schools to buy books. 

He can buy 100 books for $500. So, the question is asking how many books he can buy per school. Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to figure out how many books he can buy in total with $27,000, and then divide that by three since there are three schools.

Let me start by understanding the rate at which he buys books. He spends $500 to get 100 books. So, that means for every 100 books, he spends 500 dollars. I can write that as a ratio: 100 books / $500. Maybe I can simplify that ratio to find out how many books he can buy per dollar.

So, if 100 books cost $500, then 1 book would cost $500 / 100. Let me calculate that. 500 divided by 100 is 5.5. So, each book costs $5.50. Hmm, that seems a bit expensive, but okay.

Alternatively, maybe I can find out how many books he can buy with $27,000. So, if each book is $5.50, then the total number of books he can buy is $27,000 divided by $5.50 per book. Let me do that division.

So, 27,000 divided by 5.50. Hmm, let me see. Maybe I can convert this into a fraction to make it easier. 27,000 / 5.50. To make the division easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal. That gives me 2,700,000 / 550. Hmm, that's still a big number. Maybe I can simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as how many times 5.50 goes into 27,000. Let me try that. So, 5.50 times 5 is 27.50, which is a bit more than 27,000. So, 5 times 5.50 is 27.50, which is more than 27,000. So, maybe 4 times 5.50 is 22.00. Wait, no, 5.50 times 4 is 22.00. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many books he can buy with $27,000. So, if each book is $5.50, then the number of books is 27,000 / 5.50. Let me compute that.

First, 27,000 divided by 5.50. Let me write it as 27,000 ÷ 5.50. To make this easier, I can convert 5.50 into a fraction. 5.50 is the same as 55/10. So, dividing by 55/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/55. So, 27,000 * (10/55). Let me compute that.

First, 27,000 * 10 is 27,000. Then, 27,000 divided by 55. Let me compute 27,000 ÷ 55. Hmm, 55 goes into 270 five times (5*55=275). Wait, 55*5=275, which is just 275, which is 275. So, 55 into 275 is 5. So, 27,000 ÷ 55 is 5,000. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, 55 times 500 is 27,500. Wait, no, 55 times 500 is 27,500. But we have 27,000. So, 55 into 27,000. Let me do this step by step
