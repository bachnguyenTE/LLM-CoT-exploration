Q: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.

Okay, so Ali has some money saved up, right? He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. Hmm, let me figure out how much money he has in total. 

First, I know that each $10 bill is worth $10, so four of them would be 4 times $10. Let me write that down: 4 * $10 = $40. 

Then, he has six $20 bills. Each of those is $20, so six of them would be 6 * $20. Let me calculate that: 6 * $20 = $120. 

Now, to find the total amount of money Ali has, I need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills together. So, $40 + $120. Wait, hold on, 6 times 20 is 120, right? So, $40 + $120 is $164. 

Okay, so Ali has $164 in total. Now, he gives her sister half of this total amount. Hmm, half of $164 is... let me see, 164 divided by 2 is 82. So, he gives her sister $82. 

But wait, he gives her half, so he's left with the other half. So, he has $82 left after giving her the money. 

Now, the problem says he uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. So, he has $82, and he uses 3/5 of that to buy dinner. Let me figure out how much that is. 

First, 3/5 of $82. To calculate that, I can multiply 82 by 3 and then divide by 5. So, 82 * 3 is... 246. Then, 246 divided by 5 is... let me do that division. 5 goes into 24 four times (5*4=20), remainder 4. Bring down the 6, making it 46. 5 goes into 46 nine times (5*9=45), remainder 1. So, 246 divided by 5 is 49.2. 

Wait, so he uses $49.20 to buy dinner. Hmm, that seems a bit messy with the decimal, but okay, maybe it's correct. 

So, he has $82 left, and he uses $49.20 to buy dinner. So, the amount he has after buying dinner is 82 minus 49.20. Let me subtract that. 

82 minus 49.20. Let me write it down: 82.00 minus 49.20. 

Subtracting the cents first: 00 minus 20, can't do that, so borrow a dollar. So, 100 cents minus 20 cents is 80 cents. Then, the dollars: 7 dollars minus 4 dollars is 3 dollars. So, total is 3.80, which is $3.80. 

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations. 

He had $82, used 3/5 of that, which is 49.20, so 82 - 49.20 is indeed 32.80. Wait, hold on, 82 minus 49 is 33, and then minus 0.20 is 32.80. So, $32.80. 

Wait, so I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me go back. 

He has $82 left after giving half to his sister. Then, he uses 3/5 of that to buy dinner. So, 3/5 of 82 is 49.20, so 82 - 49.20 is 32.80. So, $32.80. 

Wait, so why did I get 32.80 earlier? Because I thought 82 - 49.20 is 32.80, but I wrote 32.80, which is the same as 32.80. So, that's correct. 

So, he has $32.80 left after buying dinner. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. 

He starts with four $10s and six $20s. So, 4*10 is 40, 6*20 is 120,
