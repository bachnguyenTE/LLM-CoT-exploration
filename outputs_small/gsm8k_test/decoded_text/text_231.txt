Q: Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. How many shells does Kylie collect on Tuesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Kylie and Robert collecting shells at the beach. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. Hmm, okay, so Robert has 20 shells on Monday. That means Kylie must have collected 5 more than that. Let me write that down.

Robert on Monday: 20 shells  
Kylie on Monday: 20 + 5 = 25 shells

Alright, so on Monday, Robert has 20 and Kylie has 25. Got that.

Now, the next part says that on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what "2 times more" means. Is it 2 times as many as she had on Monday, or is it 2 times the total she had over the two days? 

I think it's the former. So, if she collected 25 on Monday, then on Tuesday, she collects 2 times that amount. Let me calculate that.

Kylie on Tuesday: 2 times Monday's amount = 2 * 25 = 50 shells

Wait, 2 times 25 is 50? That seems a lot, but okay, let me check. If she had 25 on Monday, doubling that would be 50. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the question is asking how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. So, the answer should be 50.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. Sometimes, "times more" can be confusing. Is it 2 times as many as on Monday, or 2 times the total over two days? 

In this context, since it's about collecting shells on Tuesday, it's more likely referring to the amount on Tuesday being 2 times the amount on Monday. So, yeah, 2 times 25 is 50. 

So, I think that's correct. Let me just recap:

Monday: Robert = 20, Kylie = 25  
Tuesday: Kylie = 2 * 25 = 50

Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is 50.

**Final Answer**
Kylie collects \boxed{50} shells on Tuesday.

On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more than Robert. Therefore, Kylie collects:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This means she collects:

\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \(\boxed{50}\).
