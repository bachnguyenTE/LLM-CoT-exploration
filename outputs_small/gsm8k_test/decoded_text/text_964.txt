Q: John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?

Okay, so I have this problem here: John is watching a new show. Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. The question is, how many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Each episode is 20 minutes long. That's straightforward. So, if I denote the length of each episode as E, then E = 20 minutes. Got that.

Now, the next part says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. So, the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Let me denote the number of episodes as P. So, P = (1/2) * E. Since E is 20 minutes, then P = (1/2)*20. Let me compute that: 20 divided by 2 is 10. So, P = 10 episodes.

Wait, so there are 10 episodes in total? That seems a bit low, but okay, let's go with that for now. So, each episode is 20 minutes, and there are 10 episodes. So, if John watches every episode, how many minutes will he spend?

Well, if each episode is 20 minutes and he watches one after another, then the total time would be the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode. So, total time T = P * E. Plugging in the numbers, T = 10 * 20. Let me compute that: 10 times 20 is 200, so 10 times 20 is 220. Wait, no, hold on. 10 multiplied by 20 is 220? Wait, 10 times 20 is 220? Wait, no, 10 times 20 is 200? Wait, no, 10 times 20 is 200, so 11 times 20 is 220? Wait, no, 11 times 20 is 220? Wait, 10 times 20 is 200, so 11 times 20 is 220. Wait, that can't be right because 11 times 20 is 220. Wait, but 10 times 20 is 200, so 11 times 20 is 220? Wait, no, 11 times 20 is 220? Wait, 20 times 10 is 200, 20 times 1 is 20, so 200 plus 20 is 220. Yeah, that's correct. So, 11 episodes each of 20 minutes would be 220 minutes total.

Wait, but hold on, earlier I thought P was 10, but now I'm getting P as 11. Let me double-check that. The problem says, "there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode." So, minutes per episode is 20, so half of that is 10. So, P = 10. So, 10 episodes. So, 10 episodes each of 20 minutes. So, 10 times 20 is 200 minutes. Wait, so which is it?

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode." So, minutes per episode is 20, so half as many episodes as minutes per episode. So, number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10. So, P = 10. So, 10 episodes, each 20 minutes. So, 10 * 20 = 220 minutes. Wait, but 10 * 20 is 220? Wait, 10 times 20 is 200, 1 times 20 is 20, so 200 + 20 is 240? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 10 * 20 is 200? Wait, 10 * 20 is 220? Wait, 10 * 20 is 220? Wait, 10 * 20 is 220? Wait, 10 * 20 is 200, 1 * 20 is
