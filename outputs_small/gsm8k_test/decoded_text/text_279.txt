Q: Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll define the current ages of Ruby and Sam. Let's say Ruby's current age is R and Sam's current age is S.

According to the problem, Ruby is currently 6 times older than Sam. This gives me the equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. At that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This gives me the second equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, I'll substitute the first equation into the second to solve for S:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( R \) = Ruby's current age
- \( S \) = Sam's current age

**Given:**
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute the first equation into the second.
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

**Step 2:** Expand the right side of the equation.
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

**Step 3:** Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to gather like terms.
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

**Step 4:** Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \).
\[
3S = 18
\]

**Step 5:** Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \).
\[
S = 6
\]

**Conclusion:**
Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old.
