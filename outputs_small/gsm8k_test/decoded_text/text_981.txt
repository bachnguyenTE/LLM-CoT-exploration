Q: On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.  He caught 4 times that amount on Friday and half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday.  If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, how many servings does he have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Joe catching crawfish over three days: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. That seems straightforward. Then, on Friday, he caught 4 times that amount. Hmm, so if he caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then on Friday he must have caught 4 times 3 pounds. Let me write that down:

Thursday: 3 pounds

Friday: 4 * 3 pounds = 12 pounds

Okay, so Friday he caught 12 pounds. Then, on Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch. So that would be half of 12 pounds. Let me calculate that:

Saturday: (1/2) * 12 pounds = 6 pounds

Alright, so on Saturday, he caught 6 pounds. Now, the question is asking how many servings of crawfish he has. It also mentions that 1 serving is 3 pounds. So, I think I need to find the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days and then divide that by 3 pounds per serving to get the number of servings.

Let me add up the pounds he caught each day:

Thursday: 3 pounds

Friday: 12 pounds

Saturday: 6 pounds

Total pounds = 3 + 12 +6

Let me compute that: 3 +12 is 15, and 15 +6 is 21. So, total crawfish caught is 21 pounds.

Now, since each serving is 3 pounds, the number of servings would be total pounds divided by 3.

So, 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

Wait, hold on, 21? That doesn't seem right. 3 +12 is 15, plus 6 is 21? Wait, 3 +12 is 15, plus 6 is 21? No, that's 21? Wait, 3 +12 is 15, 15 +6 is 21? No, 15 +6 is 21? Wait, 15 +6 is 21. Oh, I must have miscounted earlier. 3 +12 is 15, 15 +6 is 21. So, 21 pounds total.

So, 21 pounds divided by 3 pounds per serving is 7 servings.

Wait, but 21 divided by 3 is 7. So, 7 servings. That seems right.

Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Thursday: 3 pounds. Correct.

Friday: 4 times Thursday's catch. 4*3=12. Correct.

Saturday: Half of Friday's catch. 12/2=6. Correct.

Total: 3+12+6=21. Correct.

21 divided by 3 is 7. Correct.

So, yeah, 7 servings. That seems to add up.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. So, the answer should be 7 servings.

**Final Answer**
The total number of servings Joe has is \boxed{7}.

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) pounds. 

To find the total amount of crawfish caught, we add the amounts from each day:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since each serving is 3 pounds, the number of servings is:
\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
\]

Thus, the total number of servings Joe has is \(\boxed{7}\).
