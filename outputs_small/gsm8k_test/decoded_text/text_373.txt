Q: A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

Okay, so I have this problem here where a company bought $40,0000$ worth of equipment from a retailer. Hmm, wait, that seems like a typo. Let me check. It says $400000$, which is probably supposed to be $40,0000$ or $400,000$. Maybe it's $400,000$? I think in some countries, commas are used as decimal points, so maybe it's $400,000$? That would make it $400,000$, which is $400000$? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's $400,000$? That would be $400,000$, which is $400,000$? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me just assume it's $400,000$ because that's a common way to write large numbers with commas. So, $400,000$ dollars. That seems like a lot, but okay.

So, the company bought this equipment worth $400,000$ from a retailer. But then, pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces to the seller, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty." So, 40% of the total number were faulty. So, they returned those faulty ones, so the company only needs to pay for the functioning ones.

But wait, the total cost is $400,000. Is that the total cost for all the equipment, including the faulty ones? Or is it the total cost for the faulty ones? Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Let me read it again: "A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment."

Wait, so the total cost is $400,000$? That's $400,000$? Or is it $400,000$? Maybe it's $400,000$? That would make more sense because 40% faulty would be a significant portion.

So, let's assume the total cost is $400,000$.

So, total cost: $400,000.

Pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. So, 40% of the total number were faulty. So, they returned those faulty ones, so the company only needs to pay for the functioning ones, which is 60% of the total number.

But wait, the problem is asking for the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment. So, if the total cost is $400,000, and they returned 40% faulty ones, then they only spent 60% of $400,000 on the functioning equipment.

Wait, but hold on. Is the total cost $400,000, which includes the faulty ones? Or is the total cost $400,000, which is the cost of the faulty ones?

The wording is: "A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty."

So, the total cost is $400,000, but 40% of the total number were faulty. So, the faulty ones are 40% of the total number, but their cost is 40% of the total cost? Or is it 40% of the total cost?

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty." So, the faulty pieces are 40% of the total number, but their cost is 40% of the total cost.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the total cost is $400,000, which is 400,000. So, 40% of the total number were faulty, but their cost is 40% of the total cost.

Wait, that would mean that the faulty pieces are 40% of the total number, but their cost is 40% of the total cost. So, the company only needs to pay for
