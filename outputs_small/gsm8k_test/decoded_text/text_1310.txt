Q: Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this relay race problem here, and I need to figure out how long Vanessa took to complete her part. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's parse the information given:

1. Aaron and Vanessa are on a relay team.
2. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
3. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did.
4. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
5. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
6. We need to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. In a relay race, each runner does a part of the race, and the total distance is the sum of all their parts. So, if there are two runners, the total distance is the sum of the distances each ran.

From point 3: Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did. So, if I let the distance Aaron ran be 'a' miles, then Vanessa ran '2a' miles. But wait, the problem says Vanessa ran 4 miles. So, 2a = 4. That means a = 2. So, Aaron ran 2 miles, and Vanessa ran 4 miles.

Got that. So, the total distance of the relay race is 2 + 4 = 6 miles.

Now, moving on to point 2: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, if I let Vanessa's speed be 'v' miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is '2v' miles per minute.

Wait, hold on. Speed is distance over time, right? So, if I can find their speeds, I can figure out how long each took to run their respective distances.

But we know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. So, Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. Let me calculate his speed.

Speed = distance / time. So, Aaron's speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes = (1/3) mile per minute.

But from point 2, we know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed. So, if Aaron's speed is (1/3) mile per minute, then Vanessa's speed is half of that, which is (1/6) mile per minute.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's, then Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's. So, yes, (1/3) / 2 = (1/6) mile per minute.

So, Vanessa's speed is 1/6 mile per minute. That means she runs 1/6 mile in 1 minute. So, to find out how long she took to run 4 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = distance / speed.

So, Time = 4 miles / (1/6 mile per minute) = 4 * 6 = 24 minutes.

Wait, so Vanessa took 24 minutes to complete her part? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to confirm.

Let me denote Vanessa's speed as 'v' miles per minute. Then, Aaron's speed is '2v' miles per minute.

Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 / 16 = 1/8 miles per minute. Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back.

Wait, if I let Vanessa's speed be 'v' miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is '2v' miles per minute.

But we know that Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed is 2 / 16 = 1/8 miles per minute.

Therefore, 2v = 1/8, so v = 1/16 miles per minute.

So, that's consistent with my earlier result. So, Vanessa's speed is 1/6 mile per minute, so she takes 6 minutes per mile.

Therefore, for 4 miles, she would take 4 * 6 = 24 minutes.

So, that seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, let me think about the time each person took.

We know that time is distance divided by speed.

For Vanessa, distance is 4 miles, speed is 1/6 mile per minute, so time is 4 / (1/6) = 24 minutes.

For Aaron, distance is 2 miles, speed is 1/8 mile per minute, so time is 2 / (1/8) = 16 minutes.

Which matches the given information.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but hold on, in the problem statement, it says "Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa."
