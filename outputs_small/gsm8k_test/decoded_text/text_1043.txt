Q: There are 26 countries in South America and, in each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.  If the whole population lives in these cities, how many people are there in South America?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cities in South America. There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, I'll multiply 26 by 5 to find the total number of cities.

Next, I'll calculate the population of each city by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people per city. Each city has 1000 people, so I'll multiply the total number of cities by 1000 to get the total population.

Finally, I'll present the final answer to show the total number of people living in all the cities across South America.

To determine the total population of South America, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cities in South America:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Cities per country} = 26 \times 5 = 130
   \]

2. **Determine the population of each city:**
   
   \[
   \text{Population per city} = 1000 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Find the total population of all cities in South America:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total population} = \text{Total cities} \times \text{Population per city} = 130 \times 1000 = 1,300,000
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1,\!300,\!000}
\]
