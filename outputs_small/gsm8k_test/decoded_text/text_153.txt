Q: Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it. Let me try to break this down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can get a bit confusing, but if I take it one piece at a time, I should be able to solve it.

First, let me list out all the events that happened:

1. Dave bought a large pack of fries.
2. He ate fourteen before a seagull stole the pack.
3. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of fries that Dave ate.
4. Then three pigeons came and each ate three fries.
5. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries.
6. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind.

So, starting from the beginning, let's denote the original number of fries as, let's say, X. That's the number we need to find.

So, step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries. So, after eating, the number of fries left would be X - 14.

2. Then, a seagull stole the pack out of his hand. Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Does that mean the seagull stole the fries from Dave's hand? So, maybe the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, but Dave ate 14 before the seagull stole it. So, perhaps the seagull took the remaining fries? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again: "Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand." So, the seagull stole the pack out of Dave's hand. So, does that mean the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, and stole it? Or did the seagull take the fries that Dave ate? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, maybe it's better to interpret it as the seagull stole the pack, which had X fries, so the seagull took the entire pack, but that doesn't make much sense because then the fries would be gone. Alternatively, maybe the seagull stole the fries that Dave ate. So, Dave ate 14, then the seagull stole half of that, which is 7. So, the seagull took 7 fries. So, after the seagull stole them, the number of fries left would be X - 14 -7.

Wait, but the wording is "stole the pack out of his hand." So, maybe the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, but that doesn't make sense because the fries would be gone. Alternatively, maybe the seagull stole the fries that Dave ate. So, Dave ate 14, seagull took half of that, which is 7. So, the seagull stole 7 fries. So, the fries left would be X -14 -7.

But let me think again. If the seagull stole the pack out of Dave's hand, that might mean that the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, but that would mean the fries are gone. Alternatively, maybe the seagull stole the fries that Dave ate. So, Dave ate 14, seagull took half of that, which is 7. So, the seagull stole 7 fries. So, the fries left would be X -14 -7.

But wait, the problem says "stole the pack out of his hand." So, maybe the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, but that would mean the fries are gone. Alternatively, maybe the seagull took the pack, which had X fries, but that doesn't make sense because the fries would be gone. Alternatively, maybe the seagull took the fries that were left after Dave ate 14. So, after Dave ate 14, there were X -14 left, and the seagull took half of that, which is (X -14)/2. So, the seagull took (X -14)/2 fries.

Wait, that seems more plausible. So, let's try that interpretation.

So, step by step:

1. Dave bought a pack of X fries.

2. He ate 14 before the seagull stole it. So, after eating, there are X -14 left.

3. The seagull stole half the amount Dave ate, which is 14. So, the seagull stole 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

4. So, after the seagull stole them, the fries left are X -14 -7 = X -21.

Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the seagull stole
