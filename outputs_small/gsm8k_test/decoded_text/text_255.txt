Q: Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about cows in stalls. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, there are ten stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, I can calculate the total number of cows initially. That should be 10 stalls multiplied by 20 cows per stall. Let me write that down:

Total cows initially = 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows.

Alright, so there are 220 cows in total. Wait, no, 10 stalls times 20 cows is 220? Wait, 10 times 20 is 220? Wait, 10 times 20 is 200? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. 10 stalls, each with 20 cows. So, 10 * 20. 10 times 20 is 220. Yeah, that's correct. So, 220 cows in total.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Wait, hold on, the problem says 40 cows. Let me confirm: "Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls." So, 40 cows in total, right? So, 40 cows bought.

So, he buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. Wait, 20 stalls? Wait, the problem says "twenty stalls." So, 20 stalls. So, 40 cows divided equally into 20 stalls. So, how many cows per stall?

Let me calculate that. 40 cows divided by 20 stalls. So, 40 divided by 20. Hmm, 40 divided by 20 is 2. So, 2 cows per stall. Wait, 20 stalls times 2 cows is 40 cows. So, that's correct.

So, he adds 2 cows to each of the 20 stalls. So, each stall now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.

Wait, but the question is asking: How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?

So, if each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, then 8 stalls would have 8 times 22 cows.

Let me compute that. 8 * 22. 8*20 is 160, and 8*2 is 16, so 160 +16 is 176. So, 176 cows in 8 stalls.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, initially, each stall had 20 cows. Then, Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and divided them equally into 20 stalls, so each stall gets 2 cows. So, each stall now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows. So, 8 stalls would have 8*22 = 176 cows.

Wait, but the problem says "How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?" So, is it 176? That seems straightforward.

But let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the original problem again.

"Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?"

So, ten stalls, each with 20 cows. So, 10*20=220 cows. Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, so total cows become 220 +40=264 cows. Then, he divides them equally into 20 stalls? Wait, hold on, the problem says "divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls." Wait, so he buys 40 cows and divides them equally into the twenty stalls. So, 40 cows divided by 20 stalls is 2 cows per stall. So, each stall now has 20 +2=22 cows. So, 8 stalls have 8*22=176 cows.

Wait, but the problem says "divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls." So, he's adding 40 cows to 20 stalls, so 2 per stall. So, each stall now has 22 cows. So, 8 stalls have 8*22=176 cows.

Wait, but 22
