Q: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how much water is left after mixing some drinks. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these mixture problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I take it slowly, I can get it.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. It says: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water. Then, I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that are three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Alright, so let's parse this. I have two types of drinks: orange and pineapple. Each has a certain percentage of water. I'm mixing them together, but I spill some of the orange drink. I need to find the total amount of water in the remaining mixture.

Let me start by figuring out how much water is in each drink before mixing.

Starting with the orange drink: it's 10 liters, and two-thirds of that is water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 liters. Let me calculate that. 2/3 of 10 is... 2/3 *10 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666... liters. So, approximately 6.6666 liters of water in the orange drink.

But wait, the problem says I spill one liter of the orange drink. So, I need to subtract that from the total. So, the remaining orange drink after spilling is 10 -1 =9 liters. So, the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is (2/3)*9. Let me compute that. 2/3 *9 =6 liters. So, 6 liters of water in the orange drink after spilling.

Now, moving on to the pineapple drink. It's 15 liters, and three-fifths of that is water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is (3/5)*15. Let me calculate that. 3/5 *15 =9 liters. So, 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

Now, I need to figure out the total amount of water in the remaining mixture. So, the remaining orange drink has 6 liters of water, and the pineapple drink has 9 liters of water. So, adding those together, 6 +9 =15 liters of water.

Wait, hold on. Is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, initially, I had 10 liters of orange drink with 2/3 water, which is 6.666... liters. Then, I spilled 1 liter, so 9 liters left, which is 6 liters of water. Then, I added 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is 3/5 water, so 9 liters of water. So, total water is 6 +9=15 liters.

But wait, the total mixture is 24 liters, right? 10 -1=9 liters of orange, plus 15 liters of pineapple, so 24 liters total. So, 15 liters of water in 24 liters of mixture. So, the percentage of water in the mixture is 15/24, which is 0.625, or 62.5%. That seems reasonable.

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with fractions, it's easy to make a mistake.

Starting with the orange drink: 10 liters, 2/3 water. So, 2/3 of 10 is indeed 6.666... liters. Then, spilling 1 liter, so 9 liters left. 2/3 of 9 is 6 liters. So, that's correct.

Pineapple drink: 15 liters, 3/5 water. 3/5 of 15 is 9 liters. So, that's correct.

Adding the water from both: 6 +9=15 liters. So, 15 liters of water in 24 liters total. So, 15/24=5/8=0.625, which is 62.5%. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is the mixture just the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink? Or is there any other mixing involved?

Wait, the problem says: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water, I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that are three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink.

So, does
