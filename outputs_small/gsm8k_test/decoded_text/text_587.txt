Q: At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, "This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans."  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?

Okay, so I have this problem about jelly beans in a jar at Burger Palace. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are red, blue, and green jelly beans. The jar has a note that says there's 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones. The total number of jelly beans is 4500. I need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red ones.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, according to the note, red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue ones. So, red would be B minus 1% of B, which is 0.99B. Wait, is that right? If it's 1% fewer, that means red is 99% of blue. So, yes, red = 0.99B.

Similarly, green jelly beans are 1% more than blue ones. So, green would be B plus 1% of B, which is 1.01B. That makes sense.

So, now I have expressions for red, blue, and green in terms of B. Let me write that down:

- Red (R) = 0.99B
- Blue (B) = B
- Green (G) = 1.01B

Now, the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, R + B + G = 4500.

Substituting the expressions in terms of B:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500

Let me compute the left side:

0.99B + B + 1.01B. Let me add them up.

First, 0.99B + B is 1.99B, and then adding 1.01B gives 1.99B.

Wait, 0.99 + 1 + 1.01? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.99B + B is 1.99B, and then adding 1.01B gives 1.99B + 1.01B = 3B.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.99 + 1 + 1.01 is 3.00? Wait, 0.99 + 1 is 1.99, plus 1.01 is 3.00. So, 3B = 4500.

So, 3B = 4500. Therefore, B = 4500 / 3 = 1500.

So, blue jelly beans are 1500.

Then, red is 0.99B, which is 0.99 * 1500. Let me compute that.

0.99 * 1500. Hmm, 1500 * 0.99. Let me think. 1500 * 1 is 1500, so 1500 * 0.99 is 1500 - 1500 * 0.01 = 1500 - 150 = 1350.

So, red is 1350.

Green is 1.01B, which is 1.01 * 1500. Let me compute that.

1.01 * 1500. Hmm, 1500 * 1.01. Let me break it down: 1500 * 1 = 1500, 1550 * 0.01 = 155.5. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, 1.01 is 1 + 0.1, so 1500 * 1 = 1500, and 1500 * 0.1 = 155.5. So, adding them together: 1500 + 155.5 = 1655.5? Wait, that can't be right because 1.01 * 1500 is 1665.5? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 1.01 * 1500 is 155, so 1.01 * 1500 is 1550 + 15.5 = 1565.5? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 1
