Q: An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Okay, so I have this problem about an air conditioner cooling a room. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can handle it.

First, let me restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. There's a room that's being cooled. The air conditioner can either cool it down at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when it's on low power or 3 degrees per hour when it's on high power. If the air conditioner isn't running, the room just warms up at 2 degrees per hour. 

Now, the sequence of events is as follows: the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours, and after that, it was turned off for 2 hours. The question is asking how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature was. So, essentially, we need to calculate the net cooling effect of all these operations and see how much the room has cooled down.

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Air conditioner on low: cools 2 degrees per hour.
2. Air conditioner on high: cools 3 degrees per hour.
3. Air conditioner off: warms up 2 degrees per hour.
4. Operations:
   - Low for 3 hours.
   - High for 4 hours.
   - Off for 2 hours.

I think the best way to approach this is to calculate the total cooling and total warming during these periods and then find the net change.

Let me denote the starting temperature as T. Since we're only interested in the difference from the starting temperature, the actual value of T might not matter because it will cancel out. But just to be thorough, I'll keep it in mind.

First, the air conditioner is on low for 3 hours. So, cooling at 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours. That would be:

Cooling from low = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, it's turned up to high for 4 hours. So, cooling at 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours:

Cooling from high = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

After that, it's turned off for 2 hours. So, warming up at 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours:

Warming = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, to find the net cooling, I need to add the cooling from low and high, and subtract the warming.

Net cooling = (Cooling from low + Cooling from high) - Warming

Plugging in the numbers:

Net cooling = (6 degrees + 12 degrees) - 4 degrees = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 3 hours on low: 2*3=6. 4 hours on high: 3*4=12. Total cooling: 6+12=18. Then, 2 hours off: warming is 2*2=4. So, net cooling is 18-4=14. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total cooling is 18 degrees, and the total warming is 4 degrees, so the net cooling is 14 degrees. So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

I think that makes sense. Let me visualize it:

- Start at T.
- After 3 hours on low: T - 6.
- Then, 4 hours on high: (T -6) -12 = T -18.
- Then, 2 hours off: (T -18) +4 = T -14.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to calculate each period's effect and then combine them. It's important to remember that turning the AC off adds warming, which reduces the net cooling.

So, the answer should be 14 degrees lower.

**Final Answer**
The final temperature is \boxed{14} degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when running low and 3 degrees per hour when running high. It warms the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour when off. The sequence of operations is as follows: the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then turned up to high for 4 hours, and then turned off for 2 hours.
