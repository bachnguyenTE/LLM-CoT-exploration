Okay, so Charlotte went to the kitchen supply store and wanted some items. Let me see, she wanted a set of pots and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils that were each $5.00 each. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how much her order was before and after the 20% discount.

First, let me break down the cost of each item she wanted. The pots and pans are $120.00, the mixing bowls are $20.00, and the utensils are 5 items at $5.00 each. So, I should calculate the total cost before any discount.

Starting with the pots and pans: that's straightforward, it's $120.00. Then the mixing bowls are $20.00. So, adding those together: $120.0 + $20.00. Let me do that math. 120 plus 20 is 140, so that's $140.00 so far.

Now, the utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each. So, 5 times 5 is 25. So, the utensils cost $25.00. Adding that to the previous total: $140.00 + $25.00. Let me add those: 140 plus 25 is 165. So, the total before discount is $165.00.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Pots and pans: 120, bowls: 20, utensils: 5*5=25. So, 120+20 is 140, plus 25 is 165. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total before discount is $165.00.

But then, the clerk told her everything was 20% off. So, she needs to subtract 20% from the total to get the final amount she has to pay. So, how do I calculate 20% off of $165.00?

Well, 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal. So, 0.20 multiplied by 165. Let me compute that. 0.20 times 165 is 33. So, 20% of 165 is 33. Therefore, the discount is $33.00.

So, subtracting that from the original total: 165.00 minus 33.00. Let me do that subtraction. 165 minus 33 is 132. So, the final amount she has to pay is $132.00.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 165 minus 33: 165 minus 30 is 135, minus 3 more is 132. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Charlotte's order was $165.00 before the discount, and after the 20% discount, it's $132.00.

But hold on, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do math in my head, I might slip up.

First, the items:

- Pots and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding them up: 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. So, is that correct?

Wait, no, 120 + 20 is 140, plus 25 is 145. Wait, no, 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, which one is correct?

Wait, 120 + 20 is 142, yes. Then 142 + 25 is 167. So, that's $167.00 before discount. Wait, so earlier I thought it was $165, but now I'm getting $167.00. Which
