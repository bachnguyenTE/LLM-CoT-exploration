Q: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

Okay, so Kelly is grocery shopping, and she wants to make sure she has enough money in her budget. She has a total of $65 in her cart, but wait, no, the question says her budget is $65. Hmm, let me read that again.

Wait, no, the question says Kelly’s budget is $65, and she has 5 packs of bacon, 6 packets of chicken, 3 packs of strawberries, and 7 packs of apples. Each of these items has a certain cost, and we need to figure out how much she has left after buying all these items. So, the total cost of all these items should be subtracted from her budget to find out how much she has left.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out the cost of each type of item.

She has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost for these is $10. So, each pack of bacon costs $10 divided by 5 packs. Let me write that down:

Cost per pack of bacon = Total cost of bacon / Number of packs
Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5
Cost per pack of bacon = $2

Okay, so each pack of bacon is $2. That makes sense because 5 packs at $2 each would be $10.

Next, she has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon is $2, then each packet of chicken is 2 times that. Let me calculate that:

Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * (Cost per pack of bacon)
Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2
Cost per packet of chicken = $4

So, each packet of chicken is $4. That seems reasonable because it's double the bacon price.

Moving on, she has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4. So, the total cost for strawberries is 3 times $4. Let me compute that:

Total cost for strawberries = Number of packs * Price per pack
Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4
Total cost for strawberries = $12

Wait, that seems low. 3 packs at $4 each is $12? That doesn't sound right. Let me double-check. 3 times 4 is 12, yes, that's correct. So, the strawberries are $12 in total.

Then, she has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries is $4, half of that is $2. So, each apple pack is $2. Let me calculate the total cost for apples:

Total cost for apples = Number of packs * Price per pack
Total cost for apples = 7 * $2
Total cost for apples = $14

Wait, 7 times 2 is 14, so that's correct. So, apples total $14.

Now, let me summarize the total costs:

- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: 6 packets at $4 each, which is 6 * $4 = $24
- Strawberries: 3 packs at $4 each, which is $12
- Apples: 7 packs at $2 each, which is $14

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the chicken cost because 6 packets at $4 each is 6*4=24, which is correct. Strawberries: 3*4=12, apples:7*2=14. So, adding all these up.

Total cost = Bacon + Chicken + Strawberries + Apples
Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14

Let me add them step by step:

First, $10 + $24 = $34

Then, $34 + $12 = $46

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, $10 + $24 is $34, then $34 + $12 is $46, and then $46 + $14 is $60.

Wait, that can't be right because her budget is only $65. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, let me check the numbers again.

She has 5 packs of bacon, total $10. So, that's correct.

6 packets of chicken, each twice as much as bacon. So, each is $4, so 6*4=24. That's correct.

3 packs of strawberries, each $4, so 3*4=12. Correct.

7 packs of apples, each half the price of a strawberry. So, half of $4 is $2, so 7*2=14. Correct.

So
