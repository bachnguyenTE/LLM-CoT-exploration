Q: Four books are arranged on a shelf. The first book is 31 mm thick while the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. What is the total thickness of the four books?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about four books on a shelf, and I need to find the total thickness of all four. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says the first book is 31 mm thick. That seems straightforward. So, I can write that down as:

First book: 31 mm

Next, the second book is 50 mm thick. Hmm, okay, so that's 50 mm. I can note that as:

Second book: 50 mm

Now, the third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book. Hmm, so if the second book is 50 mm, then the third book must be 50 mm minus 5 mm. Let me calculate that:

Third book: 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm

Alright, so the third book is 45 mm thick. Got that.

Then, the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. The first book is 31 mm, so twice that would be 31 mm multiplied by 2. Let me do that multiplication:

Fourth book: 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm

So, the fourth book is 62 mm thick. 

Now, to find the total thickness of all four books, I need to add up the thicknesses of each book. Let me list them again:

First book: 31 mm

Second book: 50 mm

Third book: 45 mm

Fourth book: 62 mm

So, adding them together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62. Let me compute this step by step.

First, add the first two books: 31 mm + 50 mm. Hmm, 31 plus 50. Let me think, 31 is 30 +1, and 50 is 50. So, 30 + 50 is 80, and 1 + 0 is 1, so total is 81 mm. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 31 + 50. Let me do it properly.

31 + 50: 30 + 50 is 80, and 1 + 0 is 1, so 80 +1 is 81. Yeah, that's correct. So, 31 + 50 is 81 mm.

Now, add the third book's thickness: 81 mm + 45 mm. Let me compute that. 81 + 45. 80 + 40 is 120, and 1 +5 is 6, so 120 +6 is 126 mm. So, 81 +45 is 126 mm.

Now, add the fourth book: 126 mm +62 mm. Let me do that. 126 +62. 120 +60 is 180, and 6 +2 is 8, so 180 +8 is 188 mm. So, total thickness is 188 mm.

Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes when adding, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me add them all together again:

First book: 31

Second book: 50

Third book: 45

Fourth book: 62

Adding them all: 31 +50 is 81, 81 +45 is 126, 126 +62 is 188. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can add them in a different order to verify. Let's see:

31 +62 is 93, and 50 +45 is 100. Then, 93 +100 is 193. Wait, that's different. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, that's not correct because 50 +45 is 95, not 100. Wait, no, 50 is 50, 45 is 45, so 50 +45 is 95. So, 31 +62 is 93, 50 +45 is 95, then 93 +95 is 188. Oh, okay, that makes sense. So, 31 +62 is 93, 50 +45 is 95, and 93 +95 is 188. So, that's consistent.

Wait, but when I added 31 +50 +45 +62
