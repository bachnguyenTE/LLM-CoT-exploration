Q: A 76-star flag has three rows of 8 stars, two rows of 6 stars and the rest are 5-star rows. How many rows of 5 stars are there altogether on the flag?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of stars on the flag. The flag has three rows with 8 stars each, two rows with 6 stars each, and the remaining stars are 5-star rows.

Calculating the total stars:
- 3 rows × 8 stars = 24 stars
- 2 rows × 6 stars = 12 stars
- Let the number of 5-star rows be x.

Adding these together: 24 + 12 + 5x = 36 stars.

Solving for x:
36 + 5x = 36
5x = 36 - 36
5x = 0
x = 0

Therefore, there are 0 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Stars Calculation:**
   - **3 rows of 8 stars each:**  
     \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) stars
   - **2 rows of 6 stars each:**  
     \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) stars
   - **Let \( x \) be the number of rows of 5 stars:**  
     \( x \times 5 \) stars

2. **Total Stars on the Flag:**
   \[
   24 \, (\text{from 8-star rows}) + 12 \, \! (\text{from 6-star rows}) + 5x \, (\text{from 5-star rows}) = \text{Total Stars}
   \]
   \[
   24 + 12 + 5x = 36
   \]
   \[
   36 + 5x = 36
   \]

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   5x = 36 - 36
   \]
   \[
   5x = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 0
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
