Q: Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali’s class which has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ali and John, both deans of their respective schools, and I need to figure out the combined capacity of both schools. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that John has two classes in his public school. Each of these classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which has 120 students. So, I need to find out how many students each of John's classes has and then add them together to get the total capacity of his school. Then, I can compare that to Ali's school to find the combined capacity.

Let me write down what I know:

- Ali's class has 120 students.
- John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class.
- John has two classes.

So, first, I need to find out how many students are in each of John's classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, I can calculate that by dividing 120 by 8.

Let me do that calculation: 120 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 15 is 120, right? So, 120 divided by 8 is 15. So, each of John's classes has 15 students.

Wait, that seems a bit small, but okay, maybe it's a small school. So, each class has 15 students. Since John has two classes, I need to find the total number of students in both classes combined.

So, 15 students per class times 2 classes. That would be 10 students in total for John's school.

Now, Ali's school has one class with 120 students. So, the combined capacity of both schools would be the sum of Ali's school's capacity and John's school's capacity.

So, that would be 120 students (Ali's class) plus 10 students (John's two classes). Adding those together, 120 plus 10 is 130.

Wait, so the combined capacity is 130 students? That seems a bit low, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my calculations.

Starting with Ali's class: 120 students. Each of John's classes is 1/8 of that. So, 120 divided by 8 is indeed 15. So, each class is 15 students? Wait, no, 15 students per class. Wait, 15? Wait, 120 divided by 8 is 15, so each class is 15 students. So, two classes would be 15 times 2, which is 30. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.

If each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which is 120. So, 120 divided by 8 is 15. So, each class has 15 students. So, two classes would be 15 times 2, which is 30. So, John's school has 30 students in total.

Wait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. So, Ali's school has 120 students, and John's school has 30 students. So, the combined capacity is 120 plus 30, which is 150.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought each class was 15 students. No, wait, 120 divided by 8 is 15, so each class is 15 students. So, two classes would be 30. So, that's correct.

So, the combined capacity is 120 plus 30, which is 153. Wait, hold on, 120 plus 30 is 153? Wait, 120 plus 30 is 153? Wait, 120 plus 30 is 123, plus 30 is 153. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, so I think I confused myself earlier when I thought each class was 15 students. No, that was a miscalculation. So, each class is 15 students? Wait, no, 120 divided by 8 is 15, so each class is 15 students. So, two classes would be 10 students. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation.

Wait, hold on, let me clarify. If each class is 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which is 120, then each class
