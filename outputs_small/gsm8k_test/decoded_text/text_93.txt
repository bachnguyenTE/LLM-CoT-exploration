Q: Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Lee and Gerald running the 400-meter hurdles. Let me try to understand what it's saying. 

First, it says Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the same distance. So, if I let Gerald's time be G seconds, then Lee's time would be G minus 2 seconds. 

But then, Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So, Gerald's time should decrease by 10%. 

Now, it says that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. So, I can use that information to find out what Gerald's original time was, and then apply the 10% improvement to find out his new time.

Let me write this down step by step.

Let G be Gerald's original time in seconds. Then, Lee's original time would be G - 2 seconds.

But after Gerald improved his speed by 10%, his new time is 38 seconds. So, I need to relate his original time to his new time.

Wait, speed and time are inversely related, right? If speed increases, time decreases. So, if Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his time should decrease by a certain percentage. But how much exactly?

I think I need to figure out the relationship between the percentage increase in speed and the percentage decrease in time. 

Let me recall that speed is distance divided by time. Since the distance is the same (400 meters), if speed increases by 10%, then time should decrease by a certain percentage. 

Let me denote the original speed as S. Then, the new speed after improvement is S + 10% of S, which is 1.1S.

Since speed is inversely proportional to time, the ratio of the new time to the old time is 1 / 1.1, which is approximately 0.90909.

So, if the original time was G, the new time is G * (1 / 1.1) = G * (10/11) ≈ 0.90909G.

But we know that after the improvement, Lee's time is 38 seconds. Wait, hold on. Is Lee's time 38 seconds after the improvement, or is Lee's time 38 seconds before the improvement?

Wait, let me read the problem again.

"Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles. But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?"

So, it says that after the diet improvement, Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds. So, Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is two seconds faster than Gerald's original time.

So, if Lee's time is 38 seconds, then Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

So, G = 40 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. Then, after a 10% improvement in speed, his new time is 40 * (10/111) ≈ 40 * 0.90909 ≈ 36.3636 seconds.

But the problem is asking for how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, so that would be approximately 36.3636 seconds. But since the answer is likely to be in whole numbers, maybe it's 36.36 seconds, but let me check.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, is the 10% improvement in speed leading to a 10% decrease in time? Or is it a 10% decrease in time?

No, speed and time are inversely related. So, if speed increases by 10%, time decreases by approximately 9.0909%, because 1 / 1.1 ≈ 0.9090.

So, the time is multiplied by 10/11, which is approximately 0.90909.

So, if Gerald's original time was 40 seconds, then after a 10% improvement, his time is 40 * (10/111) = 400 / 11.1 ≈ 36.3636 seconds.

But the problem is asking for how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet. So, that would be 36
