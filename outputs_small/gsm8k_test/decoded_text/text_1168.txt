Q: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says, "The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope." Hmm, so if I let the length of the blue rope be some variable, say B, then the red rope would be 4 times that, right? So, red rope length = 4B. That makes sense.

Next, it says, "The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope." Hmm, okay, so if the blue rope is shorter than the yellow one by 7 cm, that means the yellow rope is longer than the blue one by 7 cm. So, if I let the length of the yellow rope be Y, then Y = B + 7. Got it.

Now, the problem also mentions that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, red + blue + yellow = 37 cm. I can write that as an equation: 4B + B + Y = 37. But wait, I already have Y in terms of B, so I can substitute that in. So, replacing Y with (B + 7), the equation becomes 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37.

Let me simplify that. 4B + B is 5B, and then adding another B gives me 6B. Then, adding the 7 from the yellow rope, so 6B + 7 = 37. Hmm, okay, so now I can solve for B. Subtract 7 from both sides: 6B = 37 - 7, which is 30. So, 6B = 30? Wait, no, 37 - 7 is 30, right? So, 6B = 30. Then, divide both sides by 6: B = 30 / 6, which is 5. So, the blue rope is 5 cm long.

Now, since the red rope is four times the blue rope, that would be 4 * 5 = 20 cm. So, the red rope is 20 cm long. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, blue rope is 5 cm, red rope is 20 cm, and yellow rope is 5 + 7 = 12 cm. Adding them up: 5 + 20 +12 = 37 cm. Yep, that adds up. So, the red rope is 20 cm long.

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. It says the blue rope was 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope. So, yellow is longer by 7 cm, so yellow is 5 +7 =12 cm. Then, red is 4 times blue, which is 20 cm. So, 5 +20 +12 =37. Yeah, that's correct.

I think that's solid. So, the red rope is 20 cm.

**Final Answer**
The length of the red rope is \boxed{20} centimeters.

Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
4B + B + B + 7 = 37
\]
\[
6B + 7 = 37
\]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

\[
6B = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[
B = 5
\]

The length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:

\[
4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters.
