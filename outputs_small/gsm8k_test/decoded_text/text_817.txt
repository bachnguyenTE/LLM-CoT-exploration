Q: Paul needs 63 cupcakes for a birthday party happening on Saturday. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. How many more cupcakes should Paul buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.

Next, I'll add these two quantities together to find the total number of cupcakes he currently has.

After that, I'll subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs for the party to find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy.

Finally, I'll present the answer clearly.

**Solution:**

Paul needs a total of **63 cupcakes** for his birthday party. He already has:

- **8 chocolate cupcakes**
- **40 toffee cupcakes**

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has.

\[
\text{Total cupcakes Paul has} = 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

**Step 2:** Determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy.

\[
\text{Cupcakes Paul needs to buy} = 63 \text{ (total needed)} - 48 \text{ (current)} = 15 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
