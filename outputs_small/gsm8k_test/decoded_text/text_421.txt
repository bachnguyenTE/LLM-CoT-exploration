Q: There were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, and later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. How many cats were left on the rock?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about cats on a rock, and I need to figure out how many are left after some boats come and some cats run after a mouse. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says there were 50 cats on a rock. That seems straightforward. Then, four boats come and carry away 5 cats each. Hmm, so each boat takes 5 cats, and there are four boats. I think I need to calculate how many cats are taken away in total by the boats.

So, if each boat carries 5 cats and there are four boats, I can multiply 5 by 4. Let me write that out:

5 cats/boat * 4 boats = 20 cats.

Okay, so the boats take away 20 cats in total. Now, I need to subtract that from the original number of cats to find out how many are left after the boats have come. So, 50 cats minus 20 cats.

50 - 20 = 33.

Wait, hold on, 50 minus 20 is 33? Let me double-check that. 50 minus 20 is indeed 30, but wait, 50 is 50, so 50 minus 20 is 30? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 50 minus 20 is 33? Let me do the subtraction properly.

50
-22
---
33

Yes, that's correct. 50 minus 20 is 30, and 5 minus 2 is 3, so 30 + 3 is 33. So, 50 minus 22 is 33. So, after the boats have come, there are 33 cats left on the rock.

Now, the problem says later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. So, I need to find out what 3/5 of 33 is, and then subtract that number from the remaining 33 cats.

Let me calculate 3/5 of 33. To do that, I can multiply 33 by 3 and then divide by 5.

33 * 3 = 99

99 divided by 5 is 19.8.

Wait, 99 divided by 5 is 19.8? Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Let me check that again.

Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? No, wait, 33 times 3 is 99? No, that's not right. 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 is 33, so 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, no, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? No, that's not correct. 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, no, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, no, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3 is 99? Wait, 33 times 3
