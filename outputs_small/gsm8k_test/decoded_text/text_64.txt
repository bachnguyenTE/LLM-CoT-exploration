Q: Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?

Okay, so Sophia is thinking about a road trip, and she wants to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, from the problem, I know that Sophia has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up. She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. Her car's owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons. So, I need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. She drove 100 miles and then added 4 gallons to fill up her tank. That means that 4 gallons of gas was used to travel those 100 miles. So, maybe I can find out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas.

If 4 gallons get her 100 miles, then the number of miles per gallon would be 100 divided by 4. Let me write that down:

Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Wait, that seems a bit low. 25 miles per gallon? That doesn't sound right because I know cars usually get better mileage. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, 100 divided by 4 is 25. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me think again. If she used 4 gallons to go 100 miles, then 1 gallon would get her 25 miles. That does seem low, but maybe it's because she's already driven 100 miles and needed to refill her tank. Maybe her tank isn't that big? Wait, the owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons. So, maybe she had 112 gallons in her tank before she started driving, and then she used 4 gallons to refill it.

So, maybe the 4 gallons is the amount needed to fill the tank from what it was when she started. So, if the tank holds 12 gallons, and she had some gas in it before, she added 4 gallons to fill it up. So, maybe she had 12 - 4 = 8 gallons left in her tank before she started driving.

Wait, that might be a different way to think about it. So, if she had 8 gallons left, and she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles, then her mileage is 100 miles on 4 gallons, which is 25 miles per gallon. So, that still gives me 25 miles per gallon.

But that seems low. Maybe I should think about how much gas she used per mile. So, 4 gallons for 100 miles, so 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. Yeah, that's correct.

So, if her car gets 25 miles per gallon, and her tank can hold 12 gallons, then the total miles she can drive on a full tank would be 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Wait, so that would be 300 miles on a full tank. That seems reasonable. Let me check my reasoning again.

She drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons. So, 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg. Her tank can hold 12 gallons, so 12 gallons * 25 mpg = 300 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a proportion. If 4 gallons get her 100 miles, then 12 gallons would get her x miles. So, 4 gallons / 12 gallons = 100 miles / x miles. So, 4/12 = 100/x. Simplifying 4/12 is 1/3, so 1/3 = 100/x. Then, x = 100 * 3 = 300 miles. Wait, that's different. Wait, no, that can't be right because 12 gallons would give more miles.

Wait, no, wait, 4 gallons gives 100 miles, so 12 gallons would give 100 * (12/4) = 100 * 3 = 300 miles. Oh, okay, so that's the same as before. So, 300 miles.

Wait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I thought of 12 gallons, I thought of 12 gallons in the tank, but actually, she had 8 gallons left before refilling, so the 4 gallons was the amount needed to fill it up. So, the 4 gallons is
