Q: Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. Andy is planting two types of flowers: geraniums and petunias. The number of petunias he plants is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. So, if I know how many geraniums he has, I can find out how many petunias he has by subtracting 40 from that number.

The problem says he plants 90 geraniums. Wait, hold on, is that 90 or 90? Let me check. The user wrote "90 geraniums" and "40 fewer petunias that geraniums." Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Because 90 is a number, but 40 is also a number. Maybe it's supposed to be 40 fewer? So, 40 is 40, which is 40. So, 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

So, if he has 90 geraniums, then the number of petunias is 90 minus 40. Wait, 90 minus 40? That would be 50. So, 90 - 40 = 50. So, he plants 50 petunias.

Wait, let me make sure. So, 90 geraniums, and 40 fewer petunias. So, petunias = geraniums - 40. So, 90 - 40. Hmm, 90 minus 40 is 50. So, 50 petunias.

So, total number of flowers he plants is the sum of geraniums and petunias. So, 90 + 50. Let me add that up. 90 + 50. 90 + 50 is 140. So, total flowers are 140.

Wait, let me double-check. Geraniums: 90. Petunias: 40 fewer than 90, so 90 - 40 = 50. Total: 90 +50=140. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says "40 fewer petunias that geraniums." So, does that mean petunias are 40 less than geraniums? So, yes, 90 -40=50. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused with "40 fewer" versus "40 more." But in this case, it's definitely fewer, so subtraction.

So, 90 geraniums, 50 petunias, total 140.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the wording again. "40 fewer petunias that geraniums." So, "that" refers to geraniums, so petunias are 40 fewer than geraniums. So, yes, 90 -40=50.

Alternatively, if it had said "40 more petunias than geraniums," that would be 90 +40=130. But since it's "fewer," it's 50.

So, yeah, 50 petunias, 90 geraniums, total 140.

Wait, but let me check the original problem again: "Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total?"

So, "40 fewer petunias that geraniums." So, the number of petunias is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. So, petunias = geraniums -40. So, 90 -40=50. So, 50 petunias.

So, 90 +50=140. So, total flowers are 140.

Wait, but 90 is written as 90, which is 90, and 40 is 40, which is 40. So, 90 -40=50. So, 90 is 90, 40 is 40, so 90 -40=50. So, 50.

So, 90 +50=140. So, 140 total flowers.

Wait, but 90 +50=1
