Q: Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having twice as many instructions as the first one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two dishes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Kelian has two recipes for dishes. The first recipe has 20 instructions, and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first. I need to figure out how many instructions Kelian has to read in total to prepare both dishes. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Kelian has two recipes. The first one is simpler, with 20 instructions. The second one is more complicated, and it has twice as many instructions as the first. So, I need to find the total number of instructions she has to read if she wants to prepare both dishes.

Alright, so let's parse this out. The first recipe has 20 instructions. Wait, 20 is a bit unusual because usually, we write numbers without a zero at the end, but in this case, it's 20. Is that a typo? Or maybe it's just a way to represent 20? Hmm, maybe it's 20, which is twenty. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the first recipe has 20 instructions, which is 20. So, 20 is twenty, but written as 20? Wait, no, 20 is twenty. Wait, 20 is twenty, right? So, 20 is twenty, and 20 is twenty. So, maybe that's just a way of writing it. So, the first recipe is 20 instructions.

Then, the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, if the first is 20, then the second is 2 times 20. Let me write that down.

First recipe: 20 instructions.

Second recipe: 2 * 20 instructions.

So, let me compute that. 2 times 20 is... 2*20 is 40. So, the second recipe has 40 instructions.

Therefore, to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, I need to add the instructions from both recipes together. So, that would be 20 (first recipe) plus 40 (second recipe). Let me add those up.

20 + 40. Hmm, 20 plus 40 is 60. So, the total number of instructions is 60.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, first recipe is 20, second is twice that, which is 40. 20 plus 40 is 60. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the numbers. The first recipe is 20 instructions, which is 20. The second is twice as many, so 2*20 is 40. So, 20 + 40 is 60. That seems straightforward.

Is there any chance that the first recipe is 20 instructions, and the second is 20 instructions? Wait, no, the problem says the second one has twice as many instructions as the first. So, if the first is 20, the second is 40. So, 20 + 40 is 60.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as 20 being twenty, so 20 is twenty, and 2 times 20 is 40. So, 20 + 40 is 60. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Wait, but 20 is twenty, so 20 is twenty, and 2 times 20 is 40. So, 20 + 40 is 60. So, 60 instructions in total.

Is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe the first recipe is 20 instructions, and the second is 20 instructions? But that would be the same as the first, which doesn't make sense because it says twice as many. So, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the first recipe is 20 instructions, which is 20, and the second is 20 instructions, which is 20. But that would mean the second recipe is the same as the first, which contradicts the statement that it's twice as many. So, that can't be.

Therefore, I think my initial interpretation is correct. The first recipe is 20 instructions, the second is 40 instructions, totaling 60 instructions.

Wait, hold on, 20 is twenty, so 20 is twenty. So, 20 is twenty, and 2 times 20 is 40. So, 20 + 40 is 60. Wait, 20 is twenty, 40 is forty, so 20 + 40
