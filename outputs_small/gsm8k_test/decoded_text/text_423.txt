Q: Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Cole buying new jeans for a dance contest. He was torn between tattered jeans and jogger jeans, and he ended up buying both. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered ones. He saved a total of $6. It also says he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. The question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered ones. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing because the jogger jeans were already $6 less than the tattered ones. Maybe I need to figure out the original prices and then find the difference.

Let me break this down step by step. First, the tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans were $6 less than that, so that would be 28 minus 6. Let me calculate that: 28 - 6 is 22. So, the jogger jeans originally cost $22. That seems straightforward.

But then, the problem says he saved a total of $6. It also mentions that he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Hmm, so he saved some amount from each type of jeans, and the total savings is $6. Let me parse this.

He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. So, if the total savings is $6, then 1/3 of that is 2. So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans. Then, the rest, which would be 2/3 of the total savings, he saved from the tattered jeans. So, 2/3 of $6 is 4. So, he saved $4 from the tattered jeans.

Wait, but the tattered jeans originally cost $28, and he saved $4 from them. So, is the saving related to the original price? Or is it the amount he actually paid? Hmm, the problem says he bought both jeans, so maybe the savings are the amount he saved from his savings account, not the amount he actually paid. So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered ones, totaling $6.

But the question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered ones. Wait, but we already know that the jogger jeans were $22 and the tattered ones were $28, so the difference is $6. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says, "he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans." So, the total savings is $6. So, 1/3 of that is $2, which he saved from the jogger jeans, and the rest, which is 2/3, which is $4, he saved from the tattered jeans.

But the question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered ones. But we already know that the jogger jeans were $22 and the tattered ones were $28, so the difference is $14. Wait, that's not $6. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the savings are related to the original prices. So, he saved 1/3 of the original price of the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones. Let me try that approach.

So, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22, and he saved 1/3 of that, which is 22/3 ≈ $7.33. But he saved a total of $6, so that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the savings are related to the amount he spent on each type of jeans.

Wait, the problem says he bought both jeans, so he spent $28 on tattered and $22 on jogger. He saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones. So, the total savings is $6, so 1/3 of that is $2, which he saved from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 is $4, which he saved from the tattered ones.

But the question is asking how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered ones. But we already know that the jogger jeans were $22 and the tattered ones were $28, so the difference is $6. But the problem says he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered ones. So, maybe the savings are not directly related
