Q: Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Okay, so Sasha has some lumber left after buying some, and she wants to sell it to make a profit. Let me try to figure out how much she'll make. 

First, let me break down the information given. She has two types of boards: some 2x4x10 boards and some 4x4x10 boards. The 2x4x10 boards cost her $10 each, and she has ten of them. The 4x4x10 boards cost her $16 each, and she has five of those. 

Wait, hold on, the problem says the 2x4x10 boards cost her $10 each. So each of those is $10. And the 4x4x10 boards cost $16 each. So, she has ten of the smaller ones and five of the larger ones.

She wants to sell all of them. So, I need to calculate the total cost she spent on buying them and then figure out how much she makes from selling them. The difference between the total cost and the total revenue will be her profit.

Let me start by calculating the total cost. She has ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each. So, 10 times $10. Let me write that down: 10 * 10 = $110. 

Then, she has five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each. So, 5 *16 = $30. 

So, adding those together, the total cost is $1100 + $30 = $140. 

Wait, hold on, 10*10 is 110? No, 10*10 is 100, right? Because 10*10 is 100. Then 5*16 is 30. So, 100 + 30 is 130. So, total cost is $130. 

Wait, that seems off. Let me recalculate. 10 boards at $10 each: 10*10 is 100. Five boards at $16 each: 5*16 is 80. So, 100 + 80 is 180. So, total cost is $180. 

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me make sure. 10 boards at $10 each: 10*10 is 100. Five boards at $16 each: 5*16 is 80. So, 100 + 80 is 180. So, total cost is $180. 

Wait, but the problem says she has ten 2x4x10 boards that cost her $10 each. So, 10*10 is 100. And five 4x4x10 boards that cost her $16 each. So, 5*16 is 30. So, 100 + 30 is 130. So, total cost is $130. 

Wait, now I'm getting confused because different calculations give me different totals. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly.

The problem says: "She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each." So, 10 boards at $10 each: 10*10 = $110. 

"She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each." So, 5 boards at $16 each: 5*16 = $30. 

So, total cost is 111 + 30 = $141. Wait, 10*10 is 110, 5*16 is 30, so 110 + 30 is 140. So, total cost is $140. 

Wait, now I'm getting $140. So, Sasha spent $140 on buying the lumber. 

Now, she wants to sell all of it. So, I need to figure out how much she gets from selling them. 

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the selling price. Hmm. It just says she sells them all. So, maybe we need to assume that she sells them at a certain price, but since it's not given, perhaps we need to assume that she sells them at a profit margin or something. 

Wait, no, the problem is asking for profit, so maybe we need to assume that she sells them at a certain price, but since it's not given, perhaps
