Okay, so I have this problem here: There are 9,300 pennies in a cup. What is the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that each penny is worth $0.01, which is 10 cents. So, if I have a certain number of pennies, the total dollar amount would be the number of pennies multiplied by $0.01. That makes sense because each penny is a fraction of a dollar.

The problem says there are 9,300 pennies in the cup. I need to find out how much two-thirds of that number is in dollars. So, I think the first step is to calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies. Let me write that down.

So, two-thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300. Hmm, let me compute that. I can do this by dividing 9,300 by 3 first and then multiplying by 2. Let me see, 9,300 divided by 3. Let me do the division.

9,300 divided by 3. Well, 3 goes into 9 three times, so that's 3. Then, 3 goes into 3 once, so that's another 1. Then, 3 goes into 0 zero times, so that's 0. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 9,300 is 9300, right? So, 9300 divided by 3.

Let me do this step by step. 3 into 9 is 3, 3 into 3 is 1, 3 into 0 is 0, and 3 into 0 is 0. Wait, that can't be right because 3 times 3100 is 9300. So, 9300 divided by 3 is 3100. So, 9300 divided by 3 is 3100. So, two-thirds of 9300 is 2 times 3100, which is 6200. So, 6,200 pennies.

Wait, hold on, 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100, right? So, 3,100 times 2 is 6,200. So, two-thirds of 9,300 is 6,200 pennies. So, that's the number of pennies in the stack.

But the question is asking for the total dollar amount. So, each penny is $0.01, so 6,200 pennies would be 6,200 times $0.01. Let me compute that.

6,200 times 0.01 is the same as 6,200 divided by 100, which is 62. So, that would be $6.20. So, the total dollar amount is $6.20.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100, right? Because 3 times 3,000 is 9,000, and 3 times 100 is 300, so 3,000 plus 100 is 3,100. Then, 3,100 times 2 is 6,200. So, that's correct.

Then, 6,200 pennies times $0.01 each is 6,200 divided by 100, which is 62.00, so $6.20. Wait, hold on, 6,200 divided by 100 is 62, but with two decimal places, it's 62.00, which is $6.20. So, that's correct.

So, the total dollar amount is $6.20. So, I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If I have 9,300 pennies, each worth $0.01, then the total value is 9,300 * 0.01. Let me compute that.

9,300 * 0.01 is the same as 9,300 divided by 10, which is 930. So, the total value is $
