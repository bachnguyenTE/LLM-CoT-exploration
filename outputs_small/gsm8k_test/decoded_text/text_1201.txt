Q: There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about fish in a tank. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 66 fish in the tank. Hmm, okay, that's straightforward. Then it says one-third of the fish have red stripes. So, I need to find out how many fish that is. 

Alright, so one-third of 66. Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 3 is 22. So, 22 fish have red stripes. Got that down. 

Now, the problem also mentions that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Hmm, so after accounting for the red-striped fish, the rest are the ones with blue stripes. I need to figure out how many fish are left after taking out the red ones and then find 5/11 of that remaining number.

Wait, let me make sure I understand. So, total fish: 66. Red stripes: 1/3 of 66, which is 22. So, the remaining fish would be 66 minus 22. Let me do that subtraction. 66 minus 22 is 44. So, there are 44 fish left after the red ones.

Now, of these 44 remaining fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. So, I need to calculate 5/111 of 44. Hmm, 5 divided by 11 is approximately 0.4545, but I think I should do this as a fraction to keep it exact.

So, 5/11 of 44. Let me write that as (5/111) * 44. Hmm, 44 divided by 11 is 44, so 5 * 44 is 220. Wait, no, that can't be right because 5/111 of 44 is 5/111 * 44, which is (5*44)/111. 5*44 is 220, so 220 divided by 111. Let me compute that.

220 divided by 111. Hmm, 111 goes into 222 twice, but 222 is 2*111, so 222 divided by 111 is 2. But 220 is 222 minus 2, so 220 is 2*111 minus 2. So, 220 divided by 111 is 2 - (2/111). So, 220/111 is 2 - 2/111, which is approximately 1.9818.

Wait, but that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think of it differently. 44 divided by 11 is 4, because 11*4 is 44. So, 5/11 of 44 is 5*4, which is 20. Oh, that's much better. So, 5/11 of 44 is 20. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

So, now, the question is asking for the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes. So, that would be the number of red-striped fish plus the number of blue-striped fish. So, 22 plus 20 is 42.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, 66 total fish. 22 have red, 20 have blue. 22 plus 20 is 42. So, 42 fish have either red or blue stripes. Is that correct?

Let me verify the steps again. First, total fish: 66. One-third have red stripes: 66 /3 =22. Remaining fish: 66 -22=44. Then, 5/111 of 44: 44 /11=4, so 5*4=20. So, 20 fish have blue. So, 22+20=42. That seems correct.

Wait, but 5/111 of 44 is 20? Let me compute 5/111 *44. 44 divided by 11 is 4, so 5*4=20. Yes, that's correct. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

So, adding red and blue: 22+20=42. So, the total number of fish with red or blue stripes is 42.

Wait, but just to make sure, let
