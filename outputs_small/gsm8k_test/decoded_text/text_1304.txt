Q: Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the enrollment at two high schools, Norman High School and Butler High School. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School.

Let me break it down. If Norman has 4000 students, and Butler has 3/4 of that, I should calculate 3/4 of 4000 to find out how many students Butler has. Then, subtract that number from 4000 to see the difference. That should give me the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, 3/4 of 4000. To calculate that, I can multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4, or maybe divide 4000 by 4 first and then multiply by 3. Either way, it should give me the same result. Let me try both methods to double-check.

First method: Multiply 4000 by 3. Let's see, 4000 times 3. 4000 times 3 is 12,000. Wait, no, that can't be right. 4000 times 3 is actually 12,000? Wait, no, 4000 times 3 is 12,000, but 4000 is 4000, so 4000 times 3 is 12,000? Wait, that seems too high. Let me do it step by step.

4000 times 3: 4000 times 3 is 12,000, right? Because 4000 is 4 thousands, so 4 thousands times 3 is 12 thousands, which is 12,000. So, 4000 times 3 is 12,000. Then, divide that by 4. So, 12,000 divided by 4 is 3,000. So, Butler has 3,000 students.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check the other way. If I divide 4000 by 4 first, that's 1000. Then, multiply by 3, which is 3000. Yeah, same result. So, Butler has 3,000 students.

So, now, to find how much greater Norman is than Butler, I subtract the number of students at Butler from the number at Norman. So, 4000 minus 3000 is 1000. So, Norman has 1000 more students than Butler.

Wait, that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. So, 3/4 of 4000 is 3000. 4000 minus 3000 is 1000. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a ratio. If one school has 3/4 the students of the other, the difference is 1 - 3/4, which is 1/4. So, 1/4 of 4000 is 1000. So, that also gives me 1000. So, that's another way to think about it.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 1000. So, the enrollment at Norman is 1000 greater than at Butler.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says, "How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?" So, yeah, that's exactly what I calculated: 4000 minus 3000 is 1000. So, that's the difference.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be 1000.

**Final Answer**
The average enrollment at Norman High School is \boxed{1000} greater than at Butler High School.
