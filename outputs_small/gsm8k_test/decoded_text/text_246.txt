Q: Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Jean paid for her makeup. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She needs to do makeup for a movie she's in, and each day it takes her 6 hours. She needs this done 4 times a week. The movie itself takes 5 weeks to finish. After the movie is done, she gives her a 10% discount because of the amount of work done. 

Alright, let's start by calculating the total hours she needs for the makeup. Since each day she does it 6 hours and it's done 4 times a week, I can multiply 6 hours by 4. That should give me the total hours per week. 

So, 6 hours/day * 4 times/week = 24 hours/week. 

Now, the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so I need to multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks. That would be 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours. 

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 6 hours a day for 4 days a week is 24 hours per week. 24 times 5 weeks is indeed 120 hours. Yeah, that seems right.

Next, I need to calculate the total cost before the discount. The artist charges $250 per hour, so I multiply 250 by 120 hours. Let me do that multiplication. 

250 * 120. Hmm, 250 * 100 is 2500, 250 * 20 is 5000. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. 250 * 100 is 25,000. 250 * 20 is 5,000. So, 25,000 + 5,000 is 30,000. Wait, that can't be right because 250 * 120 is 50,000. Wait, no, 250 * 100 is 25,000, 250 * 20 is 5,000, so 25,000 + 5,000 is 30,000. So, 250 * 120 is 30,000. 

Wait, but 250 * 120 is 30,000? That seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me verify with another method. 250 * 120 is the same as 250 * (100 + 20) = 250*100 + 250*20 = 25,000 + 5,000 = 30,000. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total cost before discount is $30,000.

But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think again. 250 per hour, 120 hours. 250 * 120. Let me break it down differently. 250 * 100 is 25,000, and 250 * 20 is 5,000. So, 25,000 + 5,000 is 30,000. Yeah, that's correct. So, the total cost is $30,000.

Now, after the movie is done, she gives a 10% discount. So, I need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract that from the total cost. 

First, let's find 10% of 30,000. That's easy, it's 3,000. So, 10% is 3,000. 

Subtracting that from 30,000: 30,000 - 3,000 = 30,000 - 3,000 = 30,000 - 3,000 = 30,000 - 3,000 = 27,000. Wait, that can't be right. 30,000 minus 3,000 is 27,003. Wait, no, 30,000 minus 3,0
