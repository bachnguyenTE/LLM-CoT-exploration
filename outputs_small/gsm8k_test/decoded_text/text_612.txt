Q: The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many ounces of meat the basketball team consumed in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes. 

First, let's list out all the players and what they ate:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each weighing 8 ounces. Wait, hold on, that doesn't sound right. If each beef tip is 8 ounces, and they ordered multiple beef tips, then I need to know how many beef tips they had. The problem says "8 beef tips, each an ounce in size." Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Does that mean each beef tip is 8 ounces, or that each beef tip is 1 ounce? Let me read it again: "The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size." Oh, okay, so each beef tip is 1 ounce, and there are 8 of them. So that means the second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips.

3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Hmm, a pound is 16 ounces, right? Because 1 pound equals 16 ounces. So that's 16 ounces.

4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals. The problem doesn't specify how much meat they ate, so I guess we can assume they didn't eat any meat. So they contributed 0 ounces of meat.

Alright, so now let's add up all the meat consumed:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces
- Fourth player: 0 ounces
- Fifth player: 0 ounces

So, adding them up: 6 + 8 +16 +0 +0.

Let me compute that step by step:

6 + 8 is 14.

14 +16 is 20.

20 +0 is 20.

20 +0 is still 20.

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 20 ounces.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first player had a 6-ounce steak, that's straightforward. The second player had 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so 8 ounces. The third player had a 1-pound steak, which is 16 ounces. The fourth and fifth players didn't eat any meat, so they contribute nothing. So adding 6 +8 +16 is indeed 20 ounces. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step adds up correctly, and I considered all the players and their contributions. So, I'm confident that the total is 20 ounces.

**Final Answer**
The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \boxed{20}.
</think>

The basketball team consumed meat in the following amounts:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips.
3. The third player ate a 16-ounce steak (1 pound).
4. The fourth and fifth players did not eat any meat.

Adding these amounts together:

\[
6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 20 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \boxed{20}.
