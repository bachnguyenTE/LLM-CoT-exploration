Q: While playing with her friends in their school playground, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest. After about twenty minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. How many fairies are remaining?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many fairies are left after Katelyn and her friends play around the playground. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest. That seems straightforward. So, initially, there are 50 fairies. I'll write that down:

Initial number of fairies = 50

Then, it says one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn came from the east and joined the fairies that were there. Hmm, okay, so this part is a bit more complex. Let me parse that sentence again.

"one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there."

Wait, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies. So, "came from the east" – does that mean the number of fairies from the east that Katelyn saw? Or is it the number of fairies that were there from the east? Maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the sentence is: "one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there."

So, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. So, "came from the east" – perhaps that refers to the number of fairies that were there from the east? Or is it the number of fairies that Katelyn saw from the east? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read it again: "one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there."

So, "half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east." So, Katelyn saw 50 fairies, so half of that is 25. So, the friend saw 25 fairies from the east and joined the fairies that were there.

Wait, but the friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. So, if Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 25. So, the friend saw 25 fairies from the east and joined the fairies that were there.

Wait, but the friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. So, Katelyn saw 50 fairies, so half of that is 25. So, the friend saw 25 fairies from the east and joined the fairies that were there.

Wait, but the friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. So, Katelyn saw 50 fairies, so half of that is 25. So, the friend saw 25 fairies from the east and joined the fairies that were there.
