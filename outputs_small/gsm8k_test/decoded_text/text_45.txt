Q: Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Meredith writes a blog article each day as her permanent job. Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. So, each article is 4 hours. That seems straightforward.

Now, let's look at the number of articles she wrote each day. The problem states that she wrote 5 articles on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Hmm, okay, so that means Tuesday's articles are more than Monday's. Let me write that down.

Monday: 5 articles.

Tuesday: 2/5 times more than Monday. So, how do I calculate that? If she wrote 5 articles on Monday, then 2/5 times more would be 5 plus 2/5 of 5. Let me compute that.

First, 2/5 of 5 is (2/5)*5 = 2. So, 2 more articles on Tuesday. So, total articles on Tuesday would be 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? If she wrote 2/5 times more, does that mean 2/5 of Monday's articles or 2/5 of the total? Hmm, the wording says "2/5 times more articles than on Monday." So, it's 2/5 of Monday's articles added to Monday's articles. So, yes, 5 + (2/5)*5 = 5 + 2 = 7. So, Tuesday is 7 articles.

Then, on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, if Tuesday was 7, then Wednesday is 2*7 = 14 articles.

Let me summarize:

Monday: 5 articles

Tuesday: 7 articles

Wednesday: 14 articles

Now, each article takes 4 hours. So, to find the total hours, I need to calculate the total number of articles over the three days and then multiply by 4 hours per article.

So, total articles = 5 + 7 + 14.

Let me add those up: 5 + 7 is 12, and 12 +14 is 16. So, 16 articles in total.

Each article is 4 hours, so total hours = 16 * 4.

Calculating that: 16*4 is 64. So, 64 hours.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Monday: 5 articles. 5*4=20 hours.

Tuesday: 7 articles. 7*4=28 hours.

Wednesday:14 articles. 14*4=56 hours.

Total hours: 20 + 28 +56.

20 +28 is 48, and 48 +56 is 64. Wait, that's 64, not 64. Wait, 20 +28 is 48, and 48 +56 is 64? Wait, 48 +56 is 64? Wait, 48 +56 is 64? Wait, 48 +56 is 64? No, 48 +56 is 64? Wait, 48 +56 is 64? Wait, 48 +56 is 104? Wait, no, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, no, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, no, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 104? Wait, no, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 104? Wait, no, 48 +56 is 104? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 54? Wait, 48 +56 is 104? Wait, no, 48 +5
