Q: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the ages of Brandon's iPhone, Ben's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone." Hmm, okay. So if I let Ben's iPhone age be some number, then Brandon's would be four times that. But I don't know Ben's age yet. 

Next, it says: "Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone." Alright, so Ben's age is twice Suzy's. And it also says, "If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old." So Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. That seems straightforward.

So, if Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than that, then Ben's iPhone must be 2 years old. Let me write that down:

- Suzy's iPhone: 1 year
- Ben's iPhone: 2 times older than Suzy's, so 2 * 1 = 2 years

Now, moving on to the first part: "Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone." Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, then Brandon's would be 4 times that. Let me calculate that:

- Ben's iPhone: 2 years
- Brandon's iPhone: 4 * 2 = 8 years

So, does that mean Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old? That seems pretty old, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. That's given.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. So, 2 * 1 = 2. That makes sense.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times Ben's. So, 4 * 2 = 8. Yeah, that adds up.

Wait, but sometimes when people say something is "two times older," do they mean two times as old or two years older? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about that.

In common language, when someone says someone is two times older, it usually means twice as old. For example, if someone is two times older than me, they are twice my age. So, if I'm 10, someone two times older would be 20. So, in that case, Ben's iPhone being two times older than Suzy's would mean 2 * 1 = 2. So, that part is correct.

If it were two years older, then Ben's would be 1 + 2 = 3, but that doesn't make sense because the problem says "two times older," which is a multiplier, not an addition. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.

Therefore, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, and Brandon's is 4 times that, which is 8 years old. So, the answer should be 8.

But just to make sure, let me visualize the timeline. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's is two times older, so Ben is 2. Then, Brandon is four times Ben's age, so 4*2=8. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of ratios, the ages are in the ratio of 1:2:4. So, Suzy:1, Ben:2, Brandon:8. That also makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The problem is straightforward once you parse the relationships correctly. It's important to understand whether "two times older" means two times the current age or two years older. In this case, since it's a multiplier, it's two times the current age.

So, yeah, I think I'm confident that Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

**Final Answer**
The age of Brandon’s iPhone is \boxed{8}.
</think>

Given that Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, we need to determine the age of Brandon’s iPhone.

1. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Since Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Since Ben’s iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon’s iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon’s iPhone is \boxed{8}.
