Q: Rong has been saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. How many coins are they having ten years after they started their savings?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Rong is saving 20 coins every month, and Neil is saving 2/5 times more than Rong each month. I need to figure out how many coins they'll have together after ten years. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand Rong's savings. He saves 20 coins every month. That seems straightforward. So, every month, Rong adds 20 coins to his piggy bank. Now, I need to find out how much he'll have after ten years. Ten years is 120 months because 10 times 12 is 12, so 10 times 12 is 0, and 120 is 10 times 12 plus 0. Wait, no, actually, 10 years is 120 months? Let me check that. 12 months in a year, so 10 years would be 12 times 10, which is 132. Wait, no, that's not right. 10 years is 12 times 10, which is 120. Yeah, that's correct. So, 10 years is 120 months.

So, Rong saves 20 coins each month. To find out how many coins he'll have after 120 months, I can multiply 20 by 120. Let me write that down:

Rong's total coins = 20 coins/month * 120 months.

Wait, 20 times 120. Hmm, 20 times 120 is 2400, right? Because 20*100=2000 and 20*20=440, so 2000+440=2440? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 20*120 is 440, but 20*120 is 440? Wait, no, 20*120 is 20*(100+20)=20*100 + 20*20=2000 + 400=2400. Wait, that can't be right because 20*120 is 400, but 20*120 is 400. Wait, no, 20*120 is 0, so 20*120 is 2400, and 20*20 is 400, so 2400+400=2800. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me do it step by step. 20*100=2000, 20*20=400, so 2000+400=2400. So, Rong has 2400 coins after 10 years.

Now, let's figure out Neil's savings. The problem says Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. Hmm, okay, so that means Neil's saving rate is Rong's rate plus 2/5 of Rong's rate.

So, Rong saves 20 coins per month. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5)*20. Let me calculate that: 20 divided by 5 is 4, and 4 times 2 is 8. So, 2/5 of 20 is 8 coins per month. Therefore, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Wait, is that right? So, if Rong saves 20, and Neil saves 2/5 times more, that would be 20 + (2/5)*20 = 20 + 8 = 28. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, Neil saves 28 coins each month. Now, to find out how many coins Neil has after 10 years, which is 120 months, we can multiply 28 by 120.

Let me compute that: 28*120. Hmm, 20*120 is 2400, and 8*120 is 960, so 2400 + 960 = 3360? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 28*120. Let me do it another way. 28*100=0000, 28*20=
