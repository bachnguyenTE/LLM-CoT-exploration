Q: The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet. If the length of his room is 3 yards, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Billie's rectangular bedroom. The area is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. I need to find the perimeter of the room in feet. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The formula is Area = Length × Width. So, if I know the area and the length, I can find the width. Once I have both the length and the width, I can calculate the perimeter, which is the sum of all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). 

Wait, but hold on, the length is given in yards, and the area is in square feet. I need to make sure that the units are consistent before I do any calculations. Since the area is in square feet, I should convert the length from yards to feet to keep everything in the same unit system.

I remember that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, if the length is 3 yards, that should be 3 times 3 feet, right? Let me write that down:

Length = 3 yards = 3 × 3 feet = 9 feet.

Okay, so now I have the length in feet, which is 9 feet. The area is 360 square feet, so I can use the area formula to find the width.

Area = Length × Width  
360 sq ft = 9 ft × Width

To find the width, I can rearrange the formula:

Width = Area / Length  
Width = 360 sq ft / 9 ft

Let me do that division. 360 divided by 9. Hmm, 9 goes into 36 four times because 9×4=36, and then there's a 0 left. So, 360 ÷ 9 is 40. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.

Wait, 9 × 40 is 360, right? Because 9 × 40 = 360. So, yes, the width is 40 feet.

Wait, that seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct. Let me double-check. If the length is 9 feet and the width is 40 feet, then the area would be 9 × 40 = 360 square feet, which matches the given area. Okay, so that seems correct.

Now that I have both the length and the width in feet, I can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Plugging in the values:

Perimeter = 2 × (9 ft + 40 ft)  
Perimeter = 2 × (49 ft)  
Perimeter = 98 ft

So, the perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

Wait, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, converting yards to feet: 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet. Then, using the area formula, 360 sq ft = 9 ft × width, so width is 360 ÷ 9 = 40 ft. Then, perimeter is 2 × (9 + 40) = 2 × 49 = 98 ft. Yeah, that all adds up.

I think that's correct. So, the perimeter is 98 feet.

**Final Answer**
The perimeter of the room is \boxed{98} feet.

The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. To find the perimeter, we first convert the length from yards to feet:

\[
3 \text{ yards} = 3 \times 3 \text{ feet} = 9 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we use the area formula to find the width:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \\
360 \text{ sq ft} = 9 \text{ ft} \times \text{Width} \\
\text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ sq ft}}{9 \text{ ft}} = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we calculate the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \\
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ ft} + 40 \text{ ft}) \\
\text{Perimeter} = 2
