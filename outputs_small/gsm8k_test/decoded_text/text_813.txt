Q: John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and DeSean making s'mores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the bag has 35 marshmallows. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean also makes 9 S'mores. Then they drop 3 marshmallows on the ground. I need to find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Hmm, let me break it down. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, right? So if John makes 9 S'mores, he uses 9 marshmallows. Similarly, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he also uses 9 marshmallows. That means together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

But wait, the bag originally had 35 marshmallows. So if they used 18, that seems like more than they had. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me read the problem again.

"John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?"

Wait, so they bought 35 marshmallows. John makes 9, DeSean makes 9, so that's 18 used. Then they dropped 3, so total used is 18 + 3 = 21. So the total used is 21 marshmallows.

So the remaining marshmallows are 35 - 21 = 14. So 14 marshmallows left.

Now, how many S'mores can each kid have? Each S'more is one marshmallow, so each kid can have as many S'mores as they have marshmallows.

But wait, the problem says "how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag." Hmm, does that mean each kid can have some number of S'mores, or how many S'mores in total? Maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. It says, "how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag." So maybe each kid can have some number of S'mores, but how many? Or perhaps it's asking how many S'mores each kid can have in total, considering the remaining marshmallows.

Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. The total number of marshmallows left is 14. So if they want to distribute these 14 marshmallows equally between John and DeSean, each can have 7 marshmallows, so each can make 7 S'mores.

But the problem says "how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag." So maybe it's asking how many S'mores each kid can have, considering the remaining marshmallows. So if they have 14 marshmallows left, each kid can have 7 S'mores.

Alternatively, maybe it's asking how many S'mores each kid can make in total, but that doesn't make much sense because they already made 9 each. Wait, no, they made 9 each, but then dropped 3, so they have 14 left. So each kid can have 7 S'mores.

Wait, but the problem says "how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag." So maybe it's asking how many S'mores each kid can have, considering the remaining marshmallows. So if they have 14 left, each can have 7.

Alternatively, maybe it's asking how many S'mores each kid can make in total, but that seems redundant because they already made 9 each, but then dropped 3, so they have 14 left. So each kid can have 7.

Wait, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again.

"John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?"

So, the key is "how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag." So, the total number of marshmallows left
