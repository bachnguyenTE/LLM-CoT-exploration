Q: Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?

Okay, so Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard, and he needs to figure out how long it will take him to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. But it also mentions that he can dig half as fast through clay. So, I need to figure out his digging rate through clay. If he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, then through clay, he can dig half that speed. Let me calculate that.

Half of 4 feet per hour is 2 feet per hour. So, Bill's digging rate through clay is 2 feet/hour. Got that.

Now, the well has two sections: 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. I need to find out how long it takes him to dig each section and then add those times together to get the total time.

Starting with the soil section: 24 feet. His digging rate is 4 feet per hour. To find the time, I can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

So, for the soil, that would be 24 feet divided by 4 feet per hour. Let me do that calculation.

24 ÷ 4 = 6. So, it takes him 6 hours to dig through the soil.

Next, the clay section: 8 feet. His rate through clay is 2 feet per hour. Again, using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

So, 8 ÷ 2 = 4. That means it takes him 4 hours to dig through the clay.

Now, to find the total time, I need to add the time taken for both sections together.

6 hours (soil) + 4 hours (clay) = 10 hours.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 24 divided by 4 is definitely 6, and 8 divided by 2 is 4. Adding them together gives 10. Hmm, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. If he digs 4 feet/hour through soil, in one hour he digs 4 feet. So, for 24 feet, how many hours? 24 divided by 4 is 6. Yep, that's correct.

For clay, 2 feet/hour. So, 8 divided by 2 is 4. That also checks out.

So, adding 6 and 4 gives 10 hours in total. I don't think I made any errors here.

Wait, another thought: is there any chance that the digging rates might change based on the type of soil or something? The problem says he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. So, it's a straightforward rate change. No, I don't think there's any additional complexity here.

So, I think my answer is correct. It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

**Final Answer**
It will take Bill \boxed{10} hours to dig the well.

Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil and half that speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. 

To find the time it takes to dig through 24 feet of soil:
\[
\text{Time for soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

To find the time it takes to dig through 8 feet of clay:
\[
\text{Time for clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Adding the times together gives the total time:
\[
6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
