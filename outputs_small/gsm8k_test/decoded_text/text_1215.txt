Q: Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?

Okay, so Tim is trying to guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar, and he wants to know how far off his guess was. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the jar has a square base that's 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. So, the volume of the jar must be the base area multiplied by the height. Let me write that down:

Volume = base area × height
Base area is 6 inches × 6 inches, which is 36 square inches.
Height is 15 inches.
So, Volume = 36 in² × 15 in = 180 cubic inches.

Wait, hold on, 6 times 6 is 36? No, that's not right. 6 times 6 is 36, right? Yeah, so 36 in² is 36 square inches. So, 36 × 15 is 180 cubic inches. Okay, that seems right.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, if Tim just counted the total volume of all the jelly beans, he could estimate the total number by dividing the jar's volume by the volume of one jelly bean.

So, total jelly beans = Volume of jar / Volume per jelly bean
Total jelly beans = 180 / 0.15

Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 goes into 180 how many times? Well, 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is multiplying by 20/3. So, 180 × (20/3) = 180 × (20/3). Wait, maybe I should do it another way.

Alternatively, 0.15 × 1200 = 180, because 0.15 × 1000 = 150, and 0.15 × 200 = 30, so 150 + 30 = 180. So, 0.15 × 1200 = 180. Therefore, 180 / 0.15 = 1200. So, the total number of jelly beans is 1200.

But wait, the jar is 15 inches tall, and each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, 180 / 0.15 is 1200. That seems correct.

But hold on, the problem says that the packing efficiency is about 80%. So, does that mean that Tim's initial estimate of 1200 is actually an overestimate or underestimate?

Wait, no. If the packing efficiency is 80%, that means that only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans. So, the actual number of jelly beans is less than what he calculated.

So, the real number of jelly beans is 1200 × 0.8 = 960.

Wait, let me think again. If the packing efficiency is 80%, that means that only 80% of the volume is filled with jelly beans. So, the number of jelly beans is 80% of the total volume divided by the volume per jelly bean.

So, total jelly beans = (Volume of jar × efficiency) / Volume per jelly bean
Total jelly beans = (180 × 0.8) / 0.15
Let me compute that.

First, 180 × 0.8 = 144
Then, 144 / 0.15 = 960

So, the actual number of jelly beans is 960.

But wait, the problem says that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, Tim's guess was 960, and the true number is 900.

So, how far off was his guess? I think we need to find the difference between his guess and the true number.

So, the difference is |960 - 900| = 60.

So, Tim was off by 60 jelly beans.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

First, volume of the jar: 6x6x15 = 180 cubic inches. That's correct.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, total jelly beans without considering efficiency: 180 / 0.15 = 1200. That's correct.

But with 80% efficiency,
