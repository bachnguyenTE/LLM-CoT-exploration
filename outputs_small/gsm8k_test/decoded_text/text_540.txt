Q: $18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?

Okay, so I have this problem here where $18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share the next day and then spends $8. After that, he triples the amount he has left. I need to figure out how much money he has now. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the initial sharing. It says $18 is shared among 3 boys. I don't know how the money was divided initially, but maybe I don't need to know the exact amounts each boy had. The problem mentions the eldest boy adding money, so maybe I can focus on his share.

Let me denote the initial shares of the three boys as A, B, and C, where A is the eldest. So, A + B + C = 18. But I don't know A, B, or C individually. Then, the eldest boy adds $5 to his share the next day. So, his new share becomes A + 5. Then, he spends $8 from his total so far. So, after spending, he has (A + 5) - 8 left.

Then, he saves some more and triples the amount he had left after spending. So, he triples that remaining amount. Let me write this down step by step.

1. Initial shares: A, B, C, with A + B + C = 18.
2. Eldest boy adds $5: his share becomes A + 5.
3. He spends $8: so, remaining amount is (A + 5) - 8 = A - 3.
4. Then, he triples the amount he has left: so, he has 3*(A - 3).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how much he had before spending $8. So, maybe I need to find A first? Or maybe the problem is structured in a way that the initial shares are equal? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that the initial shares are equal? Or perhaps it's not necessary.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?"

So, the initial shares are 18 divided among 3 boys. The problem doesn't specify how the money was divided, so maybe I can assume that the initial shares are equal? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, but the eldest boy adds $5 the next day, so maybe the initial shares are equal? Let me think. If the initial shares are equal, each boy would have 18/3 ≈ 2.666... dollars. But that seems a bit odd because money is usually given in whole numbers, but maybe it's okay.

But then, the eldest boy adds $5, so his share becomes 2.666 + 5 = 7.666... Then he spends $8, so he has 7.666 - 8 = negative 0.333... That doesn't make sense because he can't have negative money. So, that can't be right. So, maybe the initial shares aren't equal.

Hmm, so perhaps the initial shares are different. Maybe the eldest boy has a larger share. Let me denote the initial shares as A, B, and C, with A being the eldest. So, A + B + C = 18.

Then, A increases by $5, so his new share is A + 5. Then, he spends $8, so he has (A + 5) - 8 = A - 3 left. Then, he triples that amount, so he has 3*(A - 3) now.

But the problem is, we don't know A. So, maybe we need to find A first. But how?

Wait, maybe the problem is structured such that the initial shares are equal, but the eldest boy adds $5, so maybe the total is 18 + 5 = 23? But that seems like a stretch.

Wait, no, the problem says "18 is shared among 3 boys." So, the initial total is 18. Then, the eldest adds $5, so the total becomes 18 + 5 = 23. Then, he spends $8, so he has 23 - 8 = 15 left. Then, he triples that amount, so 15*3 = 45. So, he has $45 now.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.

Wait, so initial total is 18
