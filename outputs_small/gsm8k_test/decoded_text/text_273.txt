Q: Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of stitches required for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the 900-stitch body, which is 900 divided by 10, equaling 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so 90 multiplied by 2 equals 180 stitches.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette: 90 plus 180 equals 279 stitches.

Subtracting this from the total 1800-stitch project gives the number of stitches used for the body, sleeves, and collar: 1800 minus 279 equals 1521 stitches.

Since the sweater has two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is 1521 divided by 2, which equals 760.5 stitches per sleeve.

To determine how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Total project stitches:** 1800
- **Stitches for the body:** 900
- **Stitches for the collar:** 1/10 of the body
- **Stitches for the rosette:** 2 times the collar
- **Number of sleeves:** 2

### Step 1: Calculate Stitches for the Collar
The collar takes **1/10** of the 900-stitch body.

\[
\text{Stitches for collar} = \frac{1}{10} \times 900 = 90 \text{ stitches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Stitches for the Rosette
The rosette takes **2 times** the number of stitches as the collar.

\[
\text{Stitches for rosette} = 2 \times 99 = 188 \text{ stitches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Stitches for Collar and Rosette
\[
\text{Total for collar and rosette} = 99 + 188 = 277 \text{ stitches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Stitches for the Body and Sleeves
\[
\text{Stitches for body and sleeves} = 1800 - 277 = 1523 \text{ stitches}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Stitches per Sleeve
Since there are **2 sleeves**, divide the total stitches by 2.

\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1523}{2} = 761.5 \text{ stitches}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{761.5}
\]
