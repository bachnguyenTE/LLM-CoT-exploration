Q: Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Adam buying some new trousers and figuring out how much money he had to contribute from his savings. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. That seems straightforward. So, he spent $30 on the trousers. Now, his mother gave him $6 for this purpose. Hmm, so that's an additional $6. So, I think that means he received money from his mother, which is $6. 

Then, it says his father gave him twice as much. So, if his mother gave him $6, his father gave him twice that amount. Let me calculate that. Twice $6 is $12. So, the father gave him $12. 

Now, the question is asking how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings. So, I think this means we need to figure out how much he had to put into savings to cover the cost of the trousers, considering the money he received from his mother and father.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Adam bought the trousers for $30, but he also received money from his mother and father. So, the total amount he had was his own savings plus the money from his mother and father, which he used to buy the trousers. So, we need to find out how much he had to contribute from his savings, which would be the total amount he had before buying the trousers minus the money he received from his mother and father.

So, let me write this down:

Total amount Adam had = savings + money from mother + money from father

He spent $30 on the trousers, so:

Total amount he had = $30 (cost of trousers)

Therefore, savings = Total amount he had - (money from mother + money from father)

We know that money from mother is $6, and money from father is twice that, which is $12. So, let's add those up.

Money from mother: $6

Money from father: $12

Total received: $6 + $12 = $18

So, total amount he had is savings + $18 = $30

Therefore, savings = $30 - $18 = $12

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, no, actually, the total amount he had is savings plus the money he received. So, savings + 6 + 12 = 30

So, savings + 18 = 30

Therefore, savings = 30 - 18 = 12

So, he had $12 in savings to contribute.

Wait, that seems low, but let me check.

He bought the trousers for $30, but he only had $12 in savings. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him $12. So, total money he had was $12. Then, he used $30 to buy the trousers? That doesn't make sense because he only had $12.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?"

So, he bought the trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $12. So, total money he had was $6 + $12 = $18. So, he had $18 in savings? Wait, no, $6 + $12 is $18. So, he had $18 in total, and he used $30 to buy the trousers? That can't be right because he only had $18.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the $30 is the amount he spent, and the money he received from his mother and father is the amount he had before buying the trousers. So, he had some savings, then his mother gave him $6, and his father gave him $12, so total he had was savings + 6 + 12. Then, he used that total to buy the $30 trousers.

So, savings + 6 +12 = 30

Therefore, savings = 30 - 6 -12 = 30 -18 = 15

So, he had $5 in savings.

Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, he had $5, his mother gave him $6, father gave him $12, so total he had was $5 + $6 + $12 = $23. Then, he used $30 to buy
