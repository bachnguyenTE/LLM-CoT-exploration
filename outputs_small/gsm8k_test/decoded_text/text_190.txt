Q: John collects peaches for 3 hours.  He can collect 2 peaches a minute.  How many peaches does he collect?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many minutes John spends collecting peaches. Since he collects for 3 hours and there are 60 minutes in an hour, I multiply 3 by 60 to get the total number of minutes.

Next, I calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the rate of peaches per minute, which is 2 peaches per minute.

Finally, I multiply 180 by 2 to find the total number of peaches John collects.

**Solution:**

John collects peaches at a rate of 2 peaches per minute for 3 hours.

1. **Convert hours to minutes:**
   
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of peaches collected:**
   
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{360}
\]
