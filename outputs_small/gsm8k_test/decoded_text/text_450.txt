Q: You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the two options without the super ticket.

The regular price of a movie ticket is $12, a popcorn is $p, and a soda is $3. So, the total cost for the regular option is $12 + $p + $3.

The super ticket costs $20, which includes the regular price of a movie ticket, a popcorn, and a soda. Therefore, the total cost for the super ticket is $20.

Since the super ticket includes all the items of the regular option, the total cost for the regular option is $20 - $20 = $0.

Given that the soda costs $3, the total cost for the regular option is $12 + $p + $3 = $15 + $p.

The problem states that without the super ticket, you saved $2 by choosing the regular option. This means the regular option costs $2 less than the super ticket.

So, I can set up the equation: $15 + $p = $20 - $2.

Solving for $p, I get $p = $20 - $15 = $3.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the regular price of popcorn.

**Given:**
- **Super Ticket:** \$20 (includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and soda)
- **Regular Ticket:** \$12
- **Soda Cost:** \$3
- **Savings:** \$2 (chose the regular option instead of the super ticket)

**Let’s define:**
- **Regular Popcorn Price:** \( p \) (this is what we need to find)

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of the Regular Option**

The regular option includes:
- Movie ticket: \$12
- Popcorn: \( p \)
- Soda: \$3

So, the total cost for the regular option is:
\[
\text{Total Regular Cost} = \$12 + p + \$3 = \$15 + p
\]

**Step 2: Understand the Savings**

By not buying the super ticket and instead choosing the regular option, you saved \$2. This means:
\[
\text{Super Ticket Cost} = \text{Regular Option Cost} + \$2
\]
\[
\$20 = (\$15 + p) + \$2
\]

**Step3: Solve for \( p \)**

Subtract \$2 from both sides:
\[
\$20 - \$2 = \$15 + p
\]
\[
\$18 = \$15 + p
\]

Subtract \$15 from both sides:
\[
\$18 - \$15 = p
\]
\[
p = \$3
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$3}
\]
