Q: The number of students in a school hall was 1000. The hall had 3 entrances A, B, and C which also served as the exits. If after a meeting 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out through exit B, and the rest went out through exit C, calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

Okay, so I have this problem here about a school hall with 1000 students. There are three entrances: A, B, and C, and they also act as exits. After a meeting, some students went out through each exit. I need to figure out how many went through exit C. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the total number of students is 1000. That's straightforward. Now, the problem says that 30% of the students went out through exit A. Hmm, 30% is a percentage, so I need to calculate how many that is. To do that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the total number of students.

So, 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. Multiplying that by 1000 gives me the number of students who went through exit A. Let me write that out:

Number of students through A = 0.30 * 1000

Let me compute that. 0.30 times 1000. Well, 0.3 times 1000 is 330, right? Because 0.3 is like 30%, so 30% of 1000 is 330. So, 330 students went through exit A.

Okay, so now, after that, 3/5 of the remaining students went through exit B. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how many students were left after exit A. That would be the total minus the ones who went through A.

So, remaining students after A = 1000 - 330

Let me calculate that. 1000 minus 330 is 670. So, 670 students are left after exit A.

Now, 3/5 of these 670 went through exit B. So, I need to calculate 3/5 of 670. Let me write that down:

Number of students through B = (3/5) * 670

Calculating that, 3 divided by 5 is 0.6, so 0.6 times 670. Let me compute that. 0.6 times 600 is 360, and 0.6 times 70 is 42. So, 360 + 42 is 402. So, 402 students went through exit B.

Alright, so now, we have 670 - 402 students remaining. Let me subtract that. 670 minus 402 is... let's see, 670 minus 400 is 270, and then minus 2 more is 268. So, 268 students went through exit C.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, total students: 1000. 330 went through A, 402 went through B, so 330 + 402 is 732. Then, 1000 - 732 is 268. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the number of students who went through exit C is 268.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.

1. Total students: 1000
2. 30% went through A: 0.3 * 1000 = 330
3. Remaining students: 1000 - 330 = 670
4. 3/5 of remaining went through B: (3/5)*670 = 402
5. Remaining students after B: 670 - 402 = 268

Yep, that all adds up. So, 268 students went through exit C.

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the answer should be 268.

**Final Answer**
The number of students who went out through exit C is \boxed{268}.

The total number of students in the school hall is 1000. 

1. Calculate the number of students who went through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 330
   \]
   So, 330 students went through exit A.

2. Calculate the remaining number of students after exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 330 = 670
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students who went through exit
