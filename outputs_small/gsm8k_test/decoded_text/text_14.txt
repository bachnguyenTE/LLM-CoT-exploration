Q: In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a dance class with 20 students. Let me try to figure out how to solve it step by step. The question is asking for the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, it says 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. So, if there are 20 students in total, 20% of 20 is... let me calculate that. 20 times 00% is 22% of 20 students. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 20% of 20 students is actually 0.4 students. But we can't have a fraction of a student, so maybe I need to think differently. Maybe it's 20 students, 20% of them is 4.8? Wait, no, 20 times 0.2 is 4.4. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.

So, 20% is 0.2 in decimal. So, 20 students times 0.2 is 4.4 students. But that's a decimal, so maybe I need to round it? But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should just keep it as a decimal for now.

Wait, but 20 students, 20% is 4.4 students. So, 4.4 students in contemporary dance. But we can't have half a student, so maybe I made a mistake. Wait, 20% of 20 is 4.4, but maybe the problem expects us to use exact numbers, so perhaps 20 students, 20% is 4.4, but since we can't have a fraction, maybe it's 4 students? Or maybe the problem is expecting us to use exact percentages without worrying about whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the exact numbers.

So, 20% of 20 students is 4.4 students. So, 4.4 students in contemporary dance. Then, the problem says 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance. Hmm, so after contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining students are in jazz. So, first, we have 20 students total.

After 4.4 students in contemporary dance, the remaining students are 20 - 4.4 = 15.6 students. Then, 25% of 15.6 students are in jazz. So, 15.6 times 0.25 is 3.9 students. Again, we have a decimal here. Hmm, so maybe the problem expects us to use exact percentages, so perhaps we can ignore the decimals and just use whole numbers.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Maybe the problem is using 20 students, 20% is 4 students, so 4 students in contemporary dance. Then, the remaining students are 16. Then, 25% of 16 is 4 students in jazz. Then, the rest would be in hip-hop. So, 16 - 4 = 12 students in hip-hop. So, 12 out of 20 students. So, 12/20 is 0.6, which is 60%. So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop.

Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, maybe I should have converted the percentages to whole numbers by rounding or something. Let me try that approach.

So, total students: 20.

20% of 20 is 4.4, but since we can't have 0.4 students, maybe it's 4 students. Then, remaining students: 20 - 4 = 16.

25% of 16 students is 4 students. So, 4 students in jazz. Then, remaining students: 16 - 4 = 12. So, 12 students in hip-hop. So, 12/20 is 0.6, which is 60%. So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop.

Wait, but 25% of 16 is 4, which is exact. So, maybe the problem expects us to use exact numbers, so 4 students in contemporary, 4 in jazz, 12 in hip-hop, which is 60%.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using 20 students, 20% is 4.4, but since we can't have 0.4 students, maybe it's 4 students, and then 25% of the remaining 16 is 1.5, which is 1 or
