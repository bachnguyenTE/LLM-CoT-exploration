Q: In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?

Okay, so I have this problem about magicians cards, and I need to figure out the total number of cards in all the colors. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?"

Alright, so we have three colors: red, green, and yellow. The problem gives me the number of red cards, which is 15. Then it says there are 60% more green cards than red. Hmm, okay, so green is more than red by 60%. Then, yellow cards are equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, I need to find the total number of all these cards.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, red cards: that's straightforward, it's 15.

Next, green cards: it says there are 60% more green cards than red. So, if red is 15, then green is 15 plus 60% of 15. Wait, is that correct? Or is it 60% more than red, meaning green is 15 plus 60% of 15? Hmm, I think that's the right interpretation.

So, 60% more than red. So, 60% of red is 0.60 * 15. Let me calculate that.

0.60 * 15: 0.6 * 10 is 6, 0.6 * 5 is 3, so 6 + 3 is 9. So, 0.6 *15 is 9. So, green is 15 + 9 = 24. So, green cards are 24.

Wait, let me double-check that. If red is 15, and green is 60% more, so 15 + (0.6*15) = 15 + 9 = 24. Yeah, that seems right.

So, green is 24.

Now, yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. So, red is 15, green is 24, so sum is 15 + 24 = 39. So, yellow is 39.

So, now, to find the total number of cards, we need to add red, green, and yellow.

So, red is 15, green is 24, yellow is 39.

15 + 24 is 39, and 39 + 39 is 78.

Wait, that seems too low. Let me add them again.

15 (red) + 24 (green) = 39. Then, 39 (red + green) + 39 (yellow) = 78. Hmm, 78 total cards? That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "there are 60% more green cards than red." So, that is, green is 15 + 60% of 15, which is 15 + 9 =24. So, that's correct.

Then, yellow is as many as the sum of red and green. So, red is 15, green is24, so sum is 39, so yellow is39. So, total is 15 +24 +39.

15 +24 is 39, 39 +39 is 78. So, 78 total cards.

Wait, but 78 seems low for a set of magicians cards. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the percentages.

Wait, 60% more green than red. So, 60% of red is 9, so green is 15 +9=24. That seems correct.

Alternatively, sometimes, when people say "60% more," it can be interpreted as 60% of the original, not 60% of the new. So, if red is 15, 60% of red is 9, so green is 15 +9=24. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if someone interprets it as 60% of the total, but that would be different. But the problem says "60% more green cards than red," so it's 60% of red, not 60% of the total.

So, 60% of red is 9, so green is 24.

Then, yellow
