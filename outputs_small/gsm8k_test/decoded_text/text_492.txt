Q: Sally buys one small pizza at $8 and one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. How much does she spend in all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it's three times the cost of the small pizza, which is $8, I'll multiply 8 by 3 to find the total cost of the family-size pizza.

Next, I'll add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends.

**Solution:**

1. **Cost of the small pizza:**
   \[
   \$8
   \]

2. **Cost of the family-size pizza:**
   \[
   3 \times \$8 = \$24
   \]

3. **Total amount spent:**
   \[
   \$8 + \$24 = \$32
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$32}
\]
