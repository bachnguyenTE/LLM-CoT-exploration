Q: Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?

Okay, so Ashley has an internet speed of 20 kilobits per second. Hmm, I need to figure out her speed in megabits per hour. Let me think about how to convert this. 

First, I know that 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits. Wait, no, actually, 1 megabit is 1000 kilobits. So, 1 Mb = 1000 kb. That makes sense because the prefix 'M' stands for mega, which is 1000 times the base unit. So, 1 megabit is 1000 kilobits.

Ashley's speed is 20 kilobits per second. I need to convert this to megabits per hour. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's convert kilobits to megabits. Since 1 megabit is 1000 kilobits, I can divide the kilobits by 1000 to get megabits. So, 20 kilobits per second divided by 1000 kilobits per megabit. Let me write that down:

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 kb/Mb = ?

Calculating that, 20 divided by 1000 is 0.02. So, that's 0.02 megabits per second. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 1000 kilobits make up 1 megabit, so 20 kilobits is 20/1000 megabits. 20 divided by 1000 is 0.02, so yes, 0.02 Mb/s.

But the question asks for megabits per hour, not per second. So, I need to convert seconds to hours. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 times 60 is 3600 seconds in an hour. So, I need to multiply the speed in megabits per second by 3600 to get megabits per hour.

So, 0.02 Mb/s multiplied by 3600 seconds per hour. Let me compute that. 0.02 times 3600. Hmm, 0.02 is the same as 1/5, so 3600 divided by 5 is 720. So, 720 Mb per hour.

Wait, let me verify that. 0.02 times 3600. 0.02 times 3000 is 600, and 0.02 times 600 is 120, so 600 plus 120 is 720. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 0.02 as 20/1000, so 20/1000 times 3600. 20 times 3600 is 72000, divided by 1000 is 7.2. Wait, that's 7.2, not 720. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 20/1000 is 0.02, so 0.02 times 3600 is 720. So, 720 is correct.

Wait, but 20/1000 is 0.02, so 0.02 * 3600 is 720. So, 720 is correct. So, 720 megabits per hour.

But wait, let me think again. 20 kilobits per second is 20/1000 megabits per second, which is 0.02. Then, 0.02 multiplied by 3600 is 720. So, yes, 720.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of unit conversions. So, 20 kilobits per second. To convert to megabits per hour, I can set up the conversion factors.

First, convert kilobits to megabits: 1 megabit = 1000 kilobits, so 1 kilobit = 1/1000 megabits.

Then, convert seconds to hours: 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so 1 second = 1/3600 hours.

So, putting it together: 20 kilobits/s * (1 megabit / 1000 kilobits)
