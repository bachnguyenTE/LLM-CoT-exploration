Q: Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?

Okay, so I have this problem where three friends—Mike, Jim, and Tony—are playing a game. They've played four rounds, and I need to figure out their total points after the extra points were given in the fourth round. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the information given:

1. After 3 rounds:
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike.

2. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

I need to find the total points all three players have after the extra points were distributed in the fourth round.

Alright, let's start by figuring out how many points each player has after 3 rounds.

Mike has 21 points. That's straightforward.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike. So, if Mike has 21, Jim must have 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Hmm, "2 times more" can be a bit confusing. Is that 2 times as many as Mike, or 2 times more than Mike? I think it's the latter, meaning 2 times as many as Mike. So, 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If someone has 2 times more than another, that means they have 100% more, right? So, 2 times more than Mike would be 21 + (2 * 21) = 21 + 42 = 63? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, 2 times more is 2 times the original. So, 2 times more than Mike is 2 * 21 = 42. So, yes, 42 points for Tony.

Wait, but hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. If Mike has 21, and Tony has 2 times more, that would be 21 * 2 = 42. So, yes, that's correct.

So, after 3 rounds:

- Mike: 21
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42

Wait, hold on, 21 - 3 is 18? That seems low. Let me confirm.

Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? No, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? No, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? No, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21 - 3 is 18? Wait, 21
