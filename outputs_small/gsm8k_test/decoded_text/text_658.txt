Q: Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork. She cooked them, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. It took her 30 minutes to cook rice. I need to figure out how long it took her to cook all the food altogether. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what we know:

1. Time to cook rice: 30 minutes.
2. Time to cook pork: 20 minutes more than rice. So, if rice is 30 minutes, pork must be 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. The problem says "20 more minutes to cook pork than rice." So, yes, if rice is 30, then pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. Okay, that seems straightforward.

3. Time to cook beans: half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, beans = (pork + rice)/2. Let me compute that.

First, let's find the combined cooking time of pork and rice. That would be 50 minutes (pork) + 30 minutes (rice) = 80 minutes. Then, half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. So, beans take 40 minutes to cook.

Now, to find the total cooking time, I need to add up the times for rice, beans, and pork.

So, rice: 30 minutes

Beans: 40 minutes

Pork: 50 minutes

Total time = 30 + 40 + 50

Let me add these up step by step.

30 + 40 = 70

70 + 50 = 120

So, the total time is 120 minutes.

Wait, that seems a bit long, but let me double-check my calculations.

Rice: 30 minutes. That's given.

Pork: 20 more than rice. So, 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. That's correct.

Beans: half of (pork + rice). So, 50 + 30 = 80. Half of 80 is 40. So, beans take 40 minutes. That seems right.

Adding them up: 30 + 40 +50. 30 +40 is 70, plus 50 is 120. Yeah, that's 120 minutes.

Wait, 120 minutes is 2 hours. That seems a bit long, but maybe that's just how it is. Let me see if I interpreted the problem correctly.

The problem says: "It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice." So, if she started cooking pork, it took 20 minutes longer than rice. So, if rice took 30, then pork took 50. That seems correct.

Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, combined, pork and rice took 80 minutes, so beans took 40. That seems correct.

So, adding them up: 30 +40 +50=120. So, 120 minutes in total.

Wait, but 120 minutes is 2 hours. That seems a lot, but maybe that's just how it is. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Is it possible that the time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice? So, beans = (pork + rice)/2. So, 50 +30=80, half is 40. So, beans=40. That seems correct.

Alternatively, could it be that the beans took half the time of the combined cooking time? So, half of 80 is 40. So, same result.

Alternatively, is there a chance that the time to cook beans is half the time of the combined cooking time? So, same as above.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice."

So, yes, that's what I did. So, I think my calculations are correct.

So, total time is 120 minutes.

Wait, but 120 minutes is 2 hours. That seems a lot, but maybe that's just how it is. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, is the time to cook beans half the combined cooking
