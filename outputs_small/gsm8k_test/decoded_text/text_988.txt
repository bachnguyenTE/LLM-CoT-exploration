Okay, so Jessica makes $2,000 a month. Hmm, wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. It says $2,000.000. Maybe that's a typo? Probably meant $2,000.00, which is $2,000.00. Wait, no, that's still a bit confusing. Maybe it's $2,000.00, which is $2,000.00. Hmm, maybe it's $2,000.00. I think I'll go with $2,000.00 for now. So, $2,000.00 a month.

She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to put towards fancy shoes. Okay, so 25% of $2,000.00. Let me calculate that. 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal. So, 0.25 multiplied by $2,000.0. Let me do that. 0.25 * 2,000.00. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so a quarter of a dollar is 25 cents. So, a quarter of $2,000.00 is... Let me see, 2,000.00 divided by 4. 2,000 divided by 4 is 500, so 2,000.00 divided by 4 is 500.25. So, $500.25. So, she sets aside $500.25 each month.

Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00. So, how many shoes can she buy in a year? Hmm, okay, so first, let's figure out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since she sets aside 25% each month, that means she can spend 75% of her paycheck on shoes each month. So, 75% of $2,000.00 is how much she can spend on shoes each month.

Wait, let me think. If she sets aside 25%, then she can spend 100% - 25% = 75% on shoes. So, 75% of $2,000.00 is how much? 0.75 * 2,000.00. Let me calculate that. 0.75 * 2,000.00. 0.75 * 2,000 is 1,500. So, she can spend $1,500.00 each month on shoes.

Now, each pair of shoes is $1,000.00. So, how many pairs can she buy each month? That's 1,500 divided by 1,000. So, 1,500 / 1,000 is 1.5. So, she can buy 1.5 pairs of shoes each month. But she can't buy half a pair, right? So, does that mean she can only buy 1 pair each month? Or does she have to round up?

Wait, the question is asking how many shoes she can buy in a year. So, maybe we need to calculate the total amount she can spend on shoes in a year and then see how many pairs that is. Let me try that approach.

First, she sets aside 25% each month, so she can spend 75% on shoes. So, each month, she can spend 0.75 * 2,000.00. Let me compute that. 0.75 * 2,000.00. 0.75 * 2,000 is 1,500. So, $1,500.00 each month on shoes.

Now, how many months are in a year? 12. So, total amount she can spend on shoes in a year is 1,500.00 * 12. Let me calculate that. 1,500 * 12. 1,500 * 10 is 15,500. 1,550 + 1,500 is 3,060. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1,500 * 12 is 18,000. 500 *12 is 6,600. So, 18,
