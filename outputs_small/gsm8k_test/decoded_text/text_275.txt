Q: Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?

Okay, so Sean is practicing for his theater role, and he needs to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. The song has 54 lines, and that's the starting point. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the solo song has 54 lines. That's straightforward. Now, the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. Hmm, so if the song has 54 lines, then the first scene must have 2 times 54. Let me calculate that: 2 * 54 is 108. So, the first scene has 108 lines.

But wait, the problem says that only a third of the lines in the first scene are his lines. So, out of 108 lines, Sean only needs to memorize a third of them. Let me figure out what a third of 108 is. 108 divided by 3 is 36. So, Sean has to memorize 36 lines for the first scene.

Moving on to the second scene. It says the second scene has six more lines than the song. Since the song has 54 lines, the second scene must have 54 + 6. Let me add that up: 54 + 6 is 60. So, the second scene has 66 lines.

Now, the second scene has four-fifths of its lines that are his lines. So, out of 66 lines, Sean needs to memorize four-fifths of them. Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, and then multiplied by 4 is 52.8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because lines can't be a fraction. Did I do that right?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as 4/5 of 66. So, 4/5 * 66. Let me compute that. 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, and 13.2 multiplied by 4 is 52.8. Hmm, that's still a decimal. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 4/5 of 66 is the same as (4*66)/5. Let me compute 4*66 first. 4*60 is 240, and 4*6 is 24, so 240 +24 is 264. Then, 264 divided by 5 is 52.8. Hmm, so that's 52.8 lines. But lines can't be fractions, so maybe I need to check if the problem expects a decimal or if I made a mistake in interpreting it.

Wait, the problem says "four-fifths of them are his." So, maybe it's okay to have a decimal? Or perhaps I should have done it differently. Let me think. 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, so 13.2 times 4 is 52.8. So, 52.8 lines. Hmm, that's still a decimal. Maybe I should check if the problem expects an integer. Let me see.

Wait, 66 divided by 5 is 13.2, which is 13 and 1/5. So, 4/5 of 66 is 4*(13 + 1/5) = 4*13 + 4*(1/5) = 52 + 0.8 = 52.8. So, yeah, it's 52.8. But lines can't be fractions, so maybe I need to round it? Or perhaps the problem expects a fractional line? Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. The second scene has six more lines than the song. The song is 54 lines, so 54 +6 is 60. So, 60 lines. Then, four-fifths of 60 is 48. Wait, hold on, 4/5 of 60 is 48? Wait, 4/5 of 60 is 48? Wait, 60 divided by 5 is 12, 12 times 4 is 48. Wait, so maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, 4/5 of 66 is 52.8, but 4/5 of 60 is 48. So, perhaps I misread the number of lines in the second scene. Let me go back.

The problem says: "the second scene has six more lines than the song." The song
