Q: Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.  At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Laurel and her baby outfits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. Hmm, so that's like a set of clothes that she doesn't need anymore. So, she already has 24 outfits from her friend. Got that.

Then, at her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Hmm, okay. So, if her friend gave her 24, twice that would be 24 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down: 24 * 2 = 48. So, she got 48 more outfits at the baby shower. 

After that, her mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. So, now we have to add those 15 to the previous total. Let me add that: 48 + 15. Hmm, 48 plus 10 is 49, and then plus 5 is 54. So, that would make the total number of outfits 54.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. So, starting with 24, then twice that is 48, and then adding 15. So, 24 + 48 is 72, and then 72 +15 is 87? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, hold on. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. How many outfits does she have for her baby?"

So, the friend gave her 24, then at the baby shower, she received twice that, which is 48, and then her mom gave her 15. So, the total is 24 + 48 +15. Let me add them up step by step.

First, 24 + 48. 24 plus 40 is 64, plus 8 is 72. Then, 72 +15 is 87. So, the total number of outfits is 87.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. 24 from her friend, 48 from the baby shower, and 15 from her mom. So, 24 +48 is 72, plus 15 is 87. Yeah, that seems right.

But wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. How many outfits does she have for her baby?"

So, friend: 24, then twice that is 48, then mom:15. So, 24 +48 +15. 24 +48 is 72, plus 15 is 87. So, 87 total outfits.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, plus 15 is 87. Yeah, that's correct. So, the answer is 87.

But wait, hold on, maybe I'm adding incorrectly. Let me add them all together:

24 (from friend) + 48 (from baby shower) +15 (from mom) = 24 +48 is 72, plus 15 is 87. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 total outfits.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 is the total.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 is the total.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 is the total.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 is the total.

Wait, but 24 +48 is 72, and 72 +15 is 87. So, 87 is the total
