Q: Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  If Cindy carries all of her books at once, what will be the total weight of the books she is carrying?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cindy and her books. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, so Cindy has math, science, French, and English books. Each of her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. Her French book is heavier, weighing 4 pounds, and her English book is 3 pounds. Then, her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. The question is asking for the total weight of all the books she's carrying when she puts them all at once.

Alright, let me break this down. First, let's list out all the books and their weights:

1. Math book: 2 pounds
2. Science book: 2 pounds
3. French book: 4 pounds
4. English book: 3 pounds
5. History book: twice as much as English book.

Wait, so the history book is twice as heavy as the English book. Since the English book is 3 pounds, the history book must be 2 times 3, which is 6 pounds. Got that.

So, now I have all the weights:

- Math: 2
- Science: 2
- French: 4
- English: 3
- History: 6

Now, to find the total weight, I need to add all these together. Let me write that out:

Total weight = Math + Science + French + English + History

Plugging in the numbers:

Total weight = 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6

Let me add them step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

First, 2 + 2 is 4. Then, 4 + 4 is 8. Next, 8 + 3 is 11. Then, 11 + 6 is 17.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check. Maybe I added wrong.

Wait, 2 (math) + 2 (science) is 4. Then, 4 (French) + 3 (English) is 7. Then, 7 + 6 (history) is 13. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, hold on. Maybe I miscounted.

Wait, no, let's do it again:

Start with math: 2

Add science: 2 + 2 = 4

Add French: 4 + 4 = 8

Add English: 8 + 3 = 11

Add history: 11 + 6 = 17

Wait, that's still 17. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Let me think if I added all the books correctly.

Math: 2

Science: 2

French: 4

English: 3

History: 6

So, 2 + 2 is 4, plus 4 is 8, plus 3 is 11, plus 6 is 17. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, but let me think about the history book again. It says it weighs twice as much as her English book. The English book is 3 pounds, so 2 times 3 is 6. That seems correct.

So, adding all together: 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6.

Let me add them in a different order to see if I get the same result.

Start with math and science: 2 + 2 = 4

Then, French: 4 + 4 = 8

Then, English: 8 + 3 = 11

Then, history: 11 + 6 = 17

Same result. Hmm, okay, so maybe 17 pounds is the total weight.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. It says Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. So, does that mean each of her math and science books weigh 2 pounds? So, two books, each 2 pounds, so 4 pounds total for math and science. Then, her French book is 4 pounds, English is 3, and history is twice English, which is 6. So, 4 + 4 + 3 + 6. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I miscounted. Let me parse the problem again.

"Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each." Hmm, so does that mean each of her math and science books weigh 2 pounds? So, two books, each 2 pounds, so 4 pounds total for math and science. Then, her French book weighs 4 pounds, English book 3 pounds, and history book twice as much as English, which is 6 pounds.

So, total weight is 4 (math and science)
