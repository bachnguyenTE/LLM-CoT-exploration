Q: Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. If his brother eats 1/2 as many, how many does his brother eat in a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since the brother eats half as many as Edgar, I'll calculate half of 18.

Next, I'll find out how many days are in a week to calculate the total number of pretzels the brother eats in a week.

Finally, I'll multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week to get the total number of pretzels the brother eats in a week.

**Solution:**

Edgar eats **18** pretzels every day.

**Step 1:** Calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.

\[
\text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels}
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of days in a week.

\[
\text{Days in a week} = 7
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of pretzels the brother eats in a week.

\[
\text{Total weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{63}
\]
