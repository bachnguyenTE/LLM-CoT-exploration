Q: A shop sells school supplies. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?

Okay, so Daniel wants to buy some school supplies for his engineering class. Let me figure out how much he needs to spend. Hmm, he wants five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The prices are given, and there's a 10% discount on the total. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to calculate the cost of each type of item separately. Starting with the notebooks. Each notebook is $1.50, and he wants five of them. So, I should multiply 1.50 by 5. Let me do that: 1.50 times 5. Hmm, 1 times 5 is 5, and 0.5 times 5 is 2.5, so adding those together, that's 5 + 2.5 = 7.50. So, five notebooks cost $7.50.

Next, the pens. Each pen is $0.25, and he wants two of them. So, 0.25 times 2. Let me calculate that. 0 times 2 is 0, and 0.25 times 2 is 0.50. So, adding those together, 0 + 0.50 is 0.50. So, two pens cost $0.50.

Then, the calculator. It's $12 each, and he wants one. That's straightforward. So, 12 times 1 is 12. So, the calculator costs $12.

Lastly, the geometry set. It's $10 each, and he wants one. So, that's just $10.

Now, let me add up all these amounts to find the total cost before the discount. So, notebooks are $7.50, pens are $0.50, calculator is $12, and geometry set is $10. Let me add them one by one.

First, notebooks and pens: 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00. Then, add the calculator: 8.00 + 12.00 = 20.00. Then, add the geometry set: 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00. So, the total before discount is $30.00.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Five notebooks at $1.50 each: 1.50 * 5. 1.50 times 5 is indeed 7.50. Two pens at $0.25 each: 0.25 * 2 is 0.50. Calculator is $12, geometry set is $10. So, 7.50 + 0.50 is 8.00, plus 12.00 is 20.00, plus 10.00 is 30.00. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. So, I need to calculate 10% of $30.00 and subtract that from the total. Let me compute 10% of 30. 10% is the same as 0.10, so 30 * 0.10 = 3.00. So, the discount is $3.00.

Subtracting that from the total: 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00. So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 after the discount.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the total before discount. Five notebooks at $1.50 each: 1.50 * 5. Let me do this multiplication again. 1.50 * 5: 1*5=5, 0.50*5=2.50, so 5 + 2.50 = 7.50. Correct. Two pens at $0.25 each: 0.25 * 2 = 0.50. Correct. Calculator is $12, geometry set is $10. So, 7.50 + 0.50 is 8.00, plus 12 is 20.00, plus 10 is 30.00. So, that's correct.

10% of 30 is 3.00, so subtracting that gives 27.00. So, the final amount Daniel has to spend is $27.00.

Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes
