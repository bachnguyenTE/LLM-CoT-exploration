Q: An ice cream truck is traveling through a neighborhood. Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?

Okay, so I have this problem about an ice cream truck and children chasing it. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the ice cream truck starts at the beginning of the neighborhood. Then, children start chasing it. When the truck reaches the end of the first street, there are 5 children with it. That makes sense because the problem says "Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it." So, after the first street, 5 kids are following the truck.

Now, moving on to the second street. It says, "on the second street, each child in the existing group is joined by another child." Hmm, so if there are 5 children on the first street, on the second street, each child is joined by another child. That sounds like each child is paired with another, so maybe they form pairs? So, if there are 5 children, how does that work?

Wait, 5 is an odd number. If each child is joined by another, does that mean each child is added with another? So, for each child, they bring another one, so the number of children doubles? But 5 doubled is 10, but that seems too high. Or maybe it's that each child is joined by another child, meaning each child is added to the group, so the number increases by the number of children. So, 5 children, each is joined by another, so 5 more? So, 5 + 5 = 10? But that seems like a lot. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, maybe it's that each child is joined by another child, meaning that each child is added to the group, so the number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe it's that each child is joined by another child, so each child is paired with another, so the number doubles. So, 5 becomes 10. Hmm, but the problem says "each child is joined by another child," which could mean that each child is added to the group, so the number increases by the number of children. So, 5 becomes 10. But that seems a lot, but maybe that's how it is.

Wait, let me think again. If there are 5 children on the first street, and on the second street, each child is joined by another child. So, each child brings another child behind them? So, for each child, they have another child behind them, so the number of children increases by the number of children. So, 5 children, each brings another, so 5 more, making it 10. So, 10 children on the second street.

But that seems like a lot. Maybe I should think of it as each child is joined by another child, meaning that each child is added to the group, so the number doubles. So, 5 becomes 10. So, 10 children on the second street.

Then, on the third street, it says, "each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children." Hmm, so on the third street, each child is joined by another 2 children. So, each child is added with 2 more children. So, for each child, 2 more are added. So, if there are 10 children on the second street, each child is joined by another 2, so 10 * 2 = 20. So, 10 + 20 = 30? Wait, that seems like a lot again.

Wait, maybe it's that each child is joined by another 2 children, meaning that each child is added with 2 more, so the number increases by 2 per child. So, 10 children, each is joined by 2 more, so 10 more, making it 22. So, 22 children on the third street.

But then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, how many are now following the truck? So, after the third street, there are 22 children, and then they leave, so 22 - 5 = 17.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, the problem says: "On the second street, each child is joined by another child." So, if there are 5 children, each child is joined by another child. So, each child brings another child behind them, so the number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10. So, 10 on the second street.

Then, on the third street, each child is joined by another 2 children. So, each child is joined by 2 more children. So, for
