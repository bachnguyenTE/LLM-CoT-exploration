Q: The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.

Okay, so I have this problem here about electric poles and wires in a neighborhood. It says the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, and there are 45 wires needed. I need to find out how many poles are required. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare two quantities. In this case, the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. That means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. So, if I have more poles, I'll have more wires, and vice versa.

Let me write that down to make it clearer. The ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. So, if I let the number of poles be P and the number of wires be W, then P:W = 1:3. That can also be written as a fraction: P/W = 1/3.

Wait, is that right? So, if P is the number of poles and W is the number of wires, then P divided by W equals 1/3. So, P = (1/3) * W. That makes sense because for every pole, there are three wires.

Given that the number of wires is 45, I can plug that into the equation. So, P = (1/3) * 45. Let me calculate that. 45 divided by 3 is 15. So, P = 15.

Wait, so does that mean there are 15 poles needed? Let me double-check. If the ratio is 1:3, then for every pole, there are three wires. So, if there are 15 poles, then the number of wires should be 15 * 3 = 45. That matches the given number of wires. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as scaling the ratio. The ratio is 1:3, which is like 1 pole to 3 wires. So, if I have 45 wires, how many sets of 3 wires do I have? 45 divided by 3 is 15. So, each set corresponds to 1 pole. Therefore, 15 poles. That also makes sense.

I think I'm confident with that answer. So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

**Final Answer**
The total number of electric poles required is \boxed{15}.

The problem states that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 wires needed. We need to find the number of poles required.

First, we recognize that the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. We can express this ratio as a fraction: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \), where \( P \) is the number of poles and \( W \) is the number of wires.

Given that the number of wires \( W \) is 45, we can solve for \( P \) using the ratio:
\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \times W \]
\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45 \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \boxed{15}.
