Q: Cars have lined up on the motorway. Some of the cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 5 cars from the line take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam. There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

Next, I'll account for the 5 cars that took an exit, reducing the number of cars that needed to pass through the traffic jam by 5.

Subtracting these 5 cars from the original 30 gives me 28 cars that passed through the traffic jam.

Since the traffic jam was in two equal parts, each part had 14 cars passing through.

Therefore, 14 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

1. **Total Number of Cars Initially on the Motorway:**
   
   There were originally **30 cars** on the motorway.

2. **Cars Taking an Exit:**
   
   **5 cars** from the line took an exit, meaning they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam.

3. **Cars That Needed to Pass Through the Traffic Jam:**
   
   To find out how many cars actually drove through the traffic jam, subtract the 5 cars that took an exit from the total number of cars:
   
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} - 5 \text{ cars} = 28 \text{ cars}
   \]

4. **Cars That Drived Through the Traffic Jam:**
   
   The traffic jam was in two equal parts, each lasting 15 minutes. Since the total number of cars that passed through is 28, we can find the number of cars in each part by dividing by 2:
   
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ cars}
   \]

5. **Cars That Drived Through the Traffic Jam in the First 15 Minutes:**
   
   Therefore, **14 cars** drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
