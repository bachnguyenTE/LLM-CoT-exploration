Q: Chris is way behind on his math homework. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?

Okay, so Chris has 100 math problems to do in total. He's really behind, which is why he's struggling. Let me try to figure out how many he has left by the end of Wednesday. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, on Monday night, Chris completes 12 problems. Wait, 12? That seems like a lot for a math problem set, but okay, maybe it's a small set. So, he does 12 problems on Monday. That means after Monday, how many does he have left? Let me subtract 12 from the total 100. So, 110 problems left after Monday.

Now, on Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Hmm, so if he did 12 on Monday, then on Tuesday he does 3 times 12. Let me calculate that: 3 * 12 is 36. So, he does 36 problems on Tuesday. Now, how many does he have left after Tuesday? He had 110 left after Monday, and he did 36 on Tuesday. So, 111 - 36. Let me subtract that: 111 minus 36 is 75. So, he has 75 problems left after Tuesday.

Okay, moving on to Wednesday. He completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. So, he has 75 left, and he does 1/4 of that. Let me figure out what 1/4 of 75 is. 75 divided by 4 is... 18.75. Hmm, that's a decimal. But since we're dealing with problems, maybe we can just keep it as a fraction or convert it to a whole number? Wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the number has to be a whole number or if it can be a fraction. Hmm, but in real life, you can't do a quarter of a problem, so maybe it's okay to have a decimal. But let me think again.

Wait, 75 divided by 4 is 18.75. So, he completes 18.75 problems on Wednesday. But that doesn't make sense because you can't do half a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

"On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems." So, it's one-quarter of the remaining, which is 75. So, 75 divided by 4 is 18.75. Hmm, so maybe the answer is 18.75, but since we can't have a fraction of a problem, perhaps it's 19? Or maybe the problem expects a decimal. Hmm, the question is asking how many he has left on Thursday, so maybe it's okay to have a decimal.

But wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with 100 problems. Monday: 12 done, so 88 left. Tuesday: 3 times Monday's amount, which is 36, so 88 - 36 is 52 left. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, did I do that right?

Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the initial subtraction. Let me go back.

Total problems: 100.

Monday: 12 done. So, 100 - 12 = 88 left.

Tuesday: 3 times Monday's amount. So, 3 * 12 = 36. So, 88 - 36 = 52 left.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought he had 75 left after Tuesday. That was incorrect. It should be 52 left after Tuesday.

So, Wednesday: he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, 52 remaining. One-quarter of 52 is 13. So, 52 divided by 4 is 13. So, he completes 13 problems on Wednesday. So, 52 - 13 = 39 left.

Therefore, on Thursday, he has 39 problems left.

Wait, so let me recast the problem step by step:

1. Total problems: 100.

2. Monday: 12 done. Remaining: 100 - 12 = 88.

3. Tuesday: 3 times Monday's amount. So, 3 * 12 = 36. So, done on Tuesday: 36. Remaining: 88 - 36 = 52.

4. Wednesday: 1/4 of remaining. So, 52
