Q: Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Richard living in an apartment building. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says the building has 15 floors. Each floor has 8 units. So, I think I need to find the total number of units in the building first. That makes sense because if I know how many units are occupied and how many are unoccupied, I can find the answer.

So, if there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units should be 5 multiplied by 8. Let me write that down:

Total units = Number of floors × Units per floor
Total units = 15 × 8

Hmm, 15 times 8. Let me calculate that. 10 times 8 is 80, and 5 times 8 is 40, so 80 plus 40 is 128. So, the building has 128 units in total.

But wait, the problem says that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, I need to find out how many units are occupied and then subtract that from the total to find the unoccupied units.

So, first, let's find the number of occupied units. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then:

Occupied units = (3/4) × Total units
Occupied units = (3/4) × 128

Let me compute that. 128 divided by 4 is 32, and 32 multiplied by 3 is 96. So, 3/4 of 128 is 96. That means 96 units are occupied.

Now, to find the unoccupied units, I subtract the occupied units from the total units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 128 - 96

Calculating that, 128 minus 96. Let me do this step by step. 128 minus 90 is 38, and then minus 6 more is 32. So, 128 minus 96 is 32.

Wait, let me double-check that subtraction. 128 minus 96. If I subtract 100 from 128, I get 28, but since I subtracted 4 more than needed, I need to add back 4. So, 28 plus 4 is 32. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.

1. Total units: 15 floors × 8 units per floor = 120 units. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought it was 128, but now I'm getting 120. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait, 15 × 8. Let me compute that again. 10 × 8 is 80, and 5 × 8 is 40, so 80 + 40 is 120. So, actually, the total units are 120, not 128. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 128. That was a typo.

So, total units = 15 × 8 = 120.

Then, 3/4 of 120 is occupied. So, 120 × 3/4. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 4 is 30, and 30 multiplied by 3 is 90. So, 3/4 of 120 is 90. Therefore, occupied units are 90.

Then, unoccupied units would be 120 - 90 = 21.

Wait, hold on, that's different from my previous answer. So, now I'm confused because I thought it was 32, but now I'm getting 21.

Wait, so which one is correct? Let me figure this out.

First, the problem says each floor has 8 units, and there are 15 floors. So, 15 × 8 is 120. So, total units are 120.

Then, 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, 3/4 of 120 is 90. So, occupied units are 90.

Therefore, unoccupied units are 120 - 90 = 21.

Wait, 21? That seems low. 21 units unoccupied? That doesn't make much sense because 3/4
