Q: George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, how many fruits does George have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many pears George has based on the number of bananas he has. George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas.

To find the number of pears, I'll calculate 45% of 200 bananas and then add that to the total number of bananas.

45% of 200 is calculated as 0.45 multiplied by 200, which equals 90.

Adding this to the 200 bananas, George has a total of 200 + 90 = 312 fruits.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total number of fruits George has step by step.

1. **Number of Bananas:**
   
   George has **200 bananas**.

2. **Number of Pears:**
   
   George has **45% more pears** than bananas. To find the number of pears:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Pears} = \text{Number of Bananas} + 45\% \text{ of Number of Bananas}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Pears} = 200 + 90 = 290
   \]

3. **Total Number of Fruits:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Number of Bananas} + \text{Number of Pears}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{490}
\]
