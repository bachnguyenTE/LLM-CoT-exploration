Q: Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Faraday and his flower shop. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. Faraday sells two things: a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflowers that costs $8. He makes $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet each day. Also, each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. The question is asking how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. 

First, let's note down the key information:

1. Sunflower cost: $2 each.
2. Bouquet cost: $8 each.
3. Daily earnings from sunflowers: $26.
4. Daily earnings from bouquets: $56.
5. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
6. Time period: 3 days.

We need to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days.

Alright, so let's think about how much money Faraday makes each day from each item. He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets. So, each day, he makes a total of $26 + $56 = $12. That makes sense because 3 days would be 3 * $12 = $36. But wait, the question is about the number of sunflowers sold, not the total money. So, maybe I need to figure out how many bouquets he sold each day and then convert that into the number of sunflowers.

Let me try that approach.

First, let's find out how many bouquets Faraday sells each day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he makes $56 from bouquets each day, we can divide the daily earnings from bouquets by the cost per bouquet.

Number of bouquets per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

So, each day, he sells 7 bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day would be 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 14 sunflowers per day.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers? Wait, no, the problem says each bouquet has 12 sunflowers? Wait, no, the problem says each bouquet has 12 sunflowers? Wait, no, let me check.
