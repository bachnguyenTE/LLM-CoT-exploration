Q: Billy is buying some candy with $10 his father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?

Okay, so Billy has $10 from his father, and he wants to buy candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. After buying some candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, which are $0.05 each. He ends up buying 40 gumballs. The question is, how many pounds of candy did he buy?

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, Billy starts with $10. He buys candy, so the amount he spends on candy will be subtracted from his total, leaving him with some change. Then, he takes half of that change and buys gumballs. He buys 40 gumballs, each costing $0.05. So, I need to figure out how much money he spent on buy the gumballs, then work backwards to find out how much he had before buying the gumballs, and from there, figure out how much he spent on candy, and then how many pounds that corresponds to.

Let me write this out in equations to make it clearer.

Let me denote:
- Total money Billy has: $10
- Cost per pound of candy: $1.5
- Number of gumballs bought: 40
- Cost per gumball: $0.05
- Let x be the number of pounds of candy he bought.

First, Billy buys x pounds of candy. The cost for that would be 1.5 * x dollars.

So, the amount of money he has left after buying the candy is:
Total money - cost of candy = 10 - 1.5x

Then, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. So, the amount he takes is half of (10 -1.5x). Let me write that as:

Amount taken for gumballs = (1/2)*(10 -1.5x)

He spends this amount on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05. So, the total cost for gumballs is 40 * 0.05.

Let me compute that: 40 * 0.05 = 2.000

So, the amount he spent on gumballs is $2.00.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)*(10 -1.5x) = 2.00

Now, let's solve for x.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

10 -1.5x = 4.00

Then, subtract 10 from both sides:

-1.5x = 4.00 -10

-1.5x = -6.00

Now, divide both sides by -1.5:

x = (-6.00)/(-1.5)

x = 4.00

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes when dealing with money, it's easy to make a mistake.

So, if he bought 4 pounds of candy, that's 4 * 1.5 = $6.00.

He started with $10, so he has 10 -6 = $4.00 left.

He takes half of that, which is 2.00, and spends that on gumballs. 40 gumballs at $0.05 each is 40 *0.05 = $2.00. That matches up.

So, yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy he bought is 4.

**Final Answer**
The number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \boxed{4}.
</think>

Billy starts with $10 and buys candy costing $1.5 per pound. Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he bought. The cost for the candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars. The remaining money after buying the candy is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

Billy then takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. The amount he spends on gumballs is half of his remaining money, which is \( \frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x) \). He buys 40 gumballs, each costing $0.05, so the total cost for gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \) dollars.

Setting up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x) = 2.00
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
10 - 1.5x = 4.00
\]
