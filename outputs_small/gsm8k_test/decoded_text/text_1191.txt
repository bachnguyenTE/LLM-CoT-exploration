Q: May is getting her hair cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, how much did her cut and color cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the haircut. The color costs $40, and the cost per inch is $30. Since the hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, the length cut is 10 inches minus 8 inches, which equals 2 inches.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of the cut by multiplying the number of inches cut by the cost per inch: 2 inches multiplied by $30 per inch equals $60.

Finally, I'll add the cost of the color to the cost of the cut to find the total cost: $40 for the color plus $60 for the cut equals $100 in total.

**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of May's haircut and coloring, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the haircut:**
   - **Color Cost:** \$40
   - **Cost per Inch:** \$30
   - **Length Cut:** 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches
   - **Cost of Cut:** 2 inches × \$30/inch = \$60

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - **Total Cost:** \$40 (color) + \$60 (cut) = **\$100**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{100}
