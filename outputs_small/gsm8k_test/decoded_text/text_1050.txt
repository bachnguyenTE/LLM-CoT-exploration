Q: It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: It says that the distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. Then it says Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, and the question is asking how many kilometers she will still need to drive. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's giving me the total distance between two cities and the distance Bernice has already driven. I need to find out how much more she needs to drive. So, it's a subtraction problem, I think. I should subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to find the remaining distance.

Let me write that down. The total distance is 1955 kilometers, and she drove 325 kilometers. So, the remaining distance should be 1955 minus 325. Let me do that calculation.

1955 minus 325. Hmm, let me subtract step by step. Starting from the units place: 5 minus 5 is 0. Then, moving to the tens place: 5 minus 2 is 3. Next, the hundreds place: 9 minus 3 is 6. Finally, the thousands place: 1 minus 0 is 1. So, putting it all together, that gives me 1630 kilometers.

Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes when subtracting, especially with larger numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. So, 1955 minus 325. Maybe I can break it down differently. Let's subtract 300 from 1955 first. 1955 minus 300 is 1655. Then, subtract the remaining 25: 1655 minus 25 is 1630. Yeah, that's the same as before. So, 1630 kilometers.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misread the numbers. The total distance is 1955, which is a four-digit number. She drove 325, which is a three-digit number. So, when subtracting, I need to align the digits properly. Let me write it out vertically to visualize it better.

```
 1955
- 325
------
```

Starting from the rightmost digit: 5 minus 5 is 0. Next, 5 minus 2 is 3. Then, 9 minus 3 is 6. Finally, 1 minus 0 is 1. So, the result is 1630. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, hold on, 1955 minus 325. Let me do it another way. 1955 minus 300 is 1655, as I did before. Then, subtract 25 more: 1655 minus 25 is 1630. So, that's consistent.

Is there another way to check? Maybe by adding 325 to 1630 and seeing if it equals 1955. Let's try that. 1630 plus 325. 1630 plus 300 is 1930, and then plus 25 is 1955. Perfect, that matches the total distance. So, that must be the correct answer.

So, Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over 4 days, and the total distance is 1955 kilometers. Therefore, the remaining distance she needs to drive is 1630 kilometers.

I think that's it. It seems straightforward, but it's always good to verify. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that 1630 kilometers is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of kilometers Bernice will still need to drive is \boxed{1630}.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find out how many kilometers she will still need to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

First, we subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
\[
1955 - 325
\]

Breaking it down step by step:
- Subtracting 300 from 1955 gives 1655.
- Subtracting 25 from 1655 gives 1630.

Thus, the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive is:
\[
\boxed{1630}
\]
