Q: The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this temperature problem here, and I need to figure out what the temperature was in the morning. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?"

Alright, so starting temperature is 2°C. Then it drops by 8°C overnight. Hmm, okay, so that means we subtract 8 from the current temperature. Then, in the morning, it increases by 3°C. So we add 3 to the result after the drop. Let me write this down step by step.

First, initial temperature: 2°C.

Then, it drops 8°C. So, 2°C minus 8°C. Let me calculate that: 2 - 8. Hmm, 2 minus 8 is... negative 6. So, after the drop, the temperature is -6°C.

Then, it increases by 3°C in the morning. So, we take the previous temperature, which is -6°C, and add 3°C to it. So, -6 + 3. Let me compute that: -6 + 3 is... negative 3. So, the temperature in the morning is -3°C.

Wait, let me double-check that. Starting at 2°C, dropping 8°C: 2 - 8 is indeed -6. Then, increasing by 3°C: -6 + 3 is -3. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a net change. The temperature went from 2°C to -6°C, which is a change of -8°C. Then, it increased by 3°C, so the net change is -8 + 3, which is -5°C. So, starting at 2°C, adding a net change of -5°C, we get 2 - 5 = -3°C. That matches my previous calculation.

So, both methods give me the same result, which is -3°C. I think that's correct.

Just to visualize it, starting at 2°C, if it drops 8°C, it's like going 8 steps down from 2, which would land you at -6. Then, if you go up 3 steps from there, you end up at -3. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to handle the negative numbers correctly. When you subtract a positive number, it's like moving left on the number line, and adding a positive number is moving right. So, 2 - 8 is like moving 8 units left from 2, which is -6. Then, adding 3 is moving 3 units right from -6, which is -3.

Another way to think about it is using algebraic expressions. Let me represent the temperature changes with equations.

Let T be the initial temperature: T = 2°C.

After dropping 8°C, the temperature is T1 = T - 8 = 2 - 8 = -6°C.

Then, after increasing 3°C, the temperature is T2 = T1 + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3°C.

So, T2 = -3°C.

Alternatively, combining the two operations: T2 = T + (-8) + 3 = 2 + (-8) + 3 = 2 -8 +3 = (2 +3) -8 = 5 -8 = -3°C.

Either way, I get the same result. So, I'm pretty confident that the temperature in the morning was -3°C.

I don't think I need to consider any other factors here, like wind chill or other environmental factors, because the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's just a straightforward temperature change problem.

So, to recap:

Start: 2°C

Drop 8°C: 2 - 8 = -6°C

Increase 3°C: -6 + 3 = -3°C

Final temperature in the morning: -3°C

Yep, that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The temperature in the morning was \boxed{-3} degrees Celsius.
</think>

The initial temperature is 2 degrees Celsius. It drops 8 degrees Celsius overnight, which is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \]

Then, it increases by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning:

\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \]

Thus, the temperature in the morning is \(\boxed{-3}\) degrees Celsius.
