A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Roy, Anthony, and Eva saving money from chores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony. Hmm, okay. So, Roy's savings are higher than Anthony's. I need to figure out how much Roy has saved. 

Then, it says Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva. Eva has saved $20.00. So, Eva's savings are given, which is $20.00. That should help me find Anthony's savings first, right?

Let me write down what I know:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.

So, starting with Eva, since she has $20.00, and Anthony has $10.00 more than her. So, Anthony's savings would be Eva's savings plus $10.00. Let me calculate that.

Eva: $20.00  
Anthony: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. If Eva has $20.00, and Anthony has $10.00 more, then Anthony should have $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Anthony has $30.00. Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. So, I need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his amount to get Roy's savings.

First, let's find 40% of $30.00. To do that, I can convert 40% to a decimal, which is 0.40. Then, multiply that by $30.00.

0.40 * 30.00 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.40 times 30 is 12.00. So, 0.40 * 30.00 is 12.00. So, 40% of $30.00 is $12.000.

Therefore, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, which is Anthony's amount plus 40% of it. So, that would be $30.000 + $12.00 = $42.000.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Eva: $20.00  
Anthony: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00  
40% of $30.00: 0.40 * 30 = 12.00  
So, Roy: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. If Anthony has $30.00, and Roy has 40% more, that would be 1.40 times Anthony's amount. So, 1.40 * 30.00 = 42.00. Wait, that's different. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, no, hold on. 40% more than Anthony's $30.00 is 30 + 12 = 42. So, that would make Roy have $42.00. But earlier, I thought it was $42.00. Wait, no, 0.40 * 30.00 is 12.00, so 30 + 12 is 42. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought 0.40 * 30 is 12, so 30 +12 is 42. So, that's correct. So, Roy has $42.00.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me go through the problem again.

Eva has $20.00. Anthony has $10.00 more than Eva, so 20 +10=30. So, Anthony has $30.00. Then, Roy has 40% more than Anthony. So, 40% of 30 is 12, so 30 +12=42. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in the initial
