Q: A store offers sandwiches in 3 different package sizes: the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the second with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a third with 8 sandwiches, but the price is not indicated. Knowing that the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about sandwiches in different packages, and I need to figure out how much the 8-sandwich package will cost. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The store offers three packages:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
3. The third package has 8 sandwiches, but the price isn't indicated.

It also says that the prices are proportional. Hmm, okay, so that means the price per sandwich is the same across all packages. I think that's the key here. So, if I can find the price per sandwich from the first two packages, I can use that to find the price for the third package.

Let me write down what I know:

- Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Package 3: 8 sandwiches, unknown price.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich should be consistent. So, let me calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages.

For Package 1: $3 for 2 sandwiches. So, price per sandwich is $3 divided by 2, which is $1.50 per sandwich.

For Package 2: $6 for 4 sandwiches. So, price per sandwich is $6 divided by 4, which is $1.50 per sandwich.

Wait, that's interesting. Both packages are $1.50 per sandwich. So, that seems consistent. So, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Therefore, for the third package, which has 8 sandwiches, the cost should be 8 times the price per sandwich.

So, let me calculate that: 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich.

Hmm, 8 times 1.50. Let me do that multiplication.

First, 1.50 times 8. Let me break it down:

1.50 * 8 = (1 + 0.5) * 8 = 1*8 + 0.5*8 = 8 + 4 = $12.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, 8 sandwiches would cost $12.00? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 1.50 times 8 is 12.00? Wait, no, 1.50 is $1.50, so 1.50 * 8 is 12.00. So, $12.000? Wait, no, wait, 1.50 is $1.50, so 1.50 * 8 is 12.00. So, $12.00.

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1.50 per sandwich, so 8 sandwiches would be 8 * 1.50. Let me compute 8 * 1.50.

1.50 is the same as 150 cents. So, 8 * 150 cents is 1200 cents, which is $12.00. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The first package is 2 for $3, which is $1.50 per sandwich. The second is 4 for $6, which is $1.50 per sandwich. So, the third package is 8 for... Well, if the price is proportional, then the price per sandwich is the same, so 8 * 1.50 is $12.00.

But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me think about the ratios.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up a proportion.

Let me denote the price of the third package as x.

So, the ratio of sandwiches to price should be the same for all packages.

So, for the first package: 2 sandwiches / $3 = 4 sandwiches / $6 = 8 sandwiches / x.

So, 2/3 = 4/6 = 8/x.

Wait, 2/3 is equal to 4/6, which is 2/3. So, that's consistent.

So, 2/3 = 8/x.

Cross-multiplying, 2x = 24, so x = 12.

So, that's another way to get x = $12.00.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think again. So, if 2 sandwiches cost $3, then 4 sandwiches would cost $6, which is double the number of sandwiches, so double the price. So, 8 sandwiches would be double of 4, so double of $6, which is $12. So, that's another way to
