Q: James decides to pick some blueberries.  It cost $20 to go picking and then another $1.5 per pound.  He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.  How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so James is picking blueberries, and I need to figure out how much he saved by picking them himself instead of buying at the store. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much it cost James to pick blueberries. The problem says it costs $20 to go picking, and then another $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for the blueberries and then add the fixed cost of going picking.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = Cost to go picking + (Cost per pound × Number of pounds)

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = $20 + ($1.5 × 30)

Hmm, let me calculate the cost per pound part first. $1.5 per pound times 30 pounds. I can do this multiplication:

$1.5 × 30. Let me think, 1.5 times 30. Well, 1.5 times 3 is 4.5, so 1.5 times 30 should be 45.00. Wait, is that right? Let me check:

1.5 × 30 = 1.5 × 3 × 10 = 4.5 × 10 = 45. So yes, that's correct.

So, the cost for the blueberries is $45. Then, adding the $20 for going picking:

Total cost = $20 + $45 = $65.

Okay, so James spent $65 on picking blueberries.

Now, the question is asking how much he saved compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound. So, I need to figure out how much it would have cost him to buy 30 pounds at the store and then subtract the amount he actually spent to find the savings.

Let me calculate the cost at the store:

Cost at store = Price per pound × Number of pounds

So,

Cost at store = $2.5 × 30

Hmm, 2.5 times 30. Let me compute that. 2.5 is the same as 2 and a half, so 2 times 30 is 60, and 0.5 times 30 is 15. So, 60 + 15 = 75. So, the cost at the store is $75.

Now, James spent $65 on picking, so the savings would be the difference between what he would have spent at the store and what he actually spent.

Savings = Cost at store - Total cost

So,

Savings = $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking blueberries himself instead of buying them at the store.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the cost to go picking is $20, and the per-pound cost is $1.5. For 30 pounds, that's 1.5 × 30. Let me compute that again:

1.5 × 30. 1.5 × 10 is 15, so 1.5 × 30 is 45. So, $20 + $45 is indeed $65.

Then, the store price is $2.5 per pound. 2.5 × 30. Let me compute that:

2.5 × 30. 2 × 30 is 60, and 0.5 × 30 is 15, so 60 + 15 is 75. So, $75 at the store.

Subtracting the two: 75 - 65 is 10. So, yes, $10 saved.

I think that's correct. So, James saved $10 by picking blueberries himself.

**Final Answer**
James saved \boxed{10} dollars.

James decided to pick blueberries and spent $20 to go picking plus $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. 

First, calculate the total cost for the blueberries:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$20 + (\$1.5 \times 30)
\]
\[
\$1.5 \times 30 = \$45
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$20 + \$45 = \$65
\]

Next, calculate the cost to buy blueberries at the store:
\[
\text{Cost at store} = \$2.5 \times 30
\]
\[
\text{Cost at store} = \$75
\]
