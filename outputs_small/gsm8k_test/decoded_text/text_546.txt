Q: Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Elise writing the alphabet. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. The question is asking how many letters Elise has written in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. The alphabet has 26 letters, right? A, B, C, ..., Z. So, each time she writes it in full, that's 26 letters. She does this twice, so that's 26 times 2, which is 52 letters. Then she writes half of it once. Half of 26 is 13, so that's 13 letters. Then she re-writes everything she has already written. Hmm, so that would mean she goes back and writes all the letters she's already written, which includes the full two times and the half once.

Wait, so let me think about this. She writes it in full twice, so that's 26 letters each time, so 26 in total. Then she writes half of it once, which is 13 letters. So, up to that point, she's written 26 + 13 = 39 letters. Then she re-writes everything she has already written. So, that would mean she goes back and writes all the letters she's already written, which is 39 letters. So, adding that to the previous total, she would have written 39 + 39 = 78 letters.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when she re-writes everything she has already written, does that include the letters she wrote in full twice and the half once, or does it include the letters she wrote in full once and half once?

Let me read the problem again: "She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written." So, she writes it in full twice, which is 26 letters each time, so 52 letters. Then she writes half of it once, which is 13 letters. Then she re-writes everything she has already written. So, "everything she has already written" would include the 52 letters she wrote twice and the 13 letters she wrote once. So, that's 52 + 13 = 65 letters. So, she re-writes 65 letters.

Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe "everything she has already written" refers to the letters she has written in full twice and half once, so 26 + 26 +13 = 65 letters. So, she re-writes 65 letters. So, total letters would be 26 +26 +13 +65 = 129 letters? That seems high.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse the sentence again: "She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written." So, the first two actions are writing it in full twice, which is 26 +26 =52 letters. Then she writes half of it once, which is 13 letters. Then she re-writes everything she has already written. So, "everything she has already written" would be the 52 letters she wrote twice and the 13 letters she wrote once, so 52 +13 =65 letters. So, she re-writes 65 letters.

So, total letters would be 52 +13 +65 = 130 letters. Hmm, that seems a lot, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. Maybe "everything she has already written" refers to the letters she has written in full once and half once, which is 26 +13 =39 letters. So, she re-writes 39 letters. So, total letters would be 26 +26 +13 +39 =108 letters. Hmm, that's different.

I think the confusion is in what "everything she has already written" refers to. It could be interpreted in two ways: either the letters she has written twice and once, or the letters she has written once and half once.

Wait, let's see. The problem says: "She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written."

So, the first two actions are writing it in full twice, which is 26 letters each time, so 52 letters. Then she writes half of it
