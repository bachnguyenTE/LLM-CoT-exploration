Q: To fund his store, Mr. Josue solicited money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second company gave him twice as much. If he initially had $5000 in capital, how much capital does he have now?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Mr. Josue is trying to fund his store by getting money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much as the first. He started with $5000 in capital. I need to figure out how much capital he has now. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mr. Josue has two sources of funding: the first bank and the second bank. The first bank gives him $4000, and the second bank gives him twice that amount. So, I need to calculate how much the second bank gave him and then add that to the first bank's contribution. After that, I can add that total to his initial capital of $5000 to find out his current capital.

Alright, let's start with the first part: the first bank gave him $4000. Wait, is that $4000 or $4000? Hmm, the way it's written is $4000, which is a bit confusing because in some countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator, but in others, it's a thousand separator. But in the context of money, it's more likely to be a thousand separator. So, $4000 would be 4 thousand and 00 dollars, which is $4000. Wait, that seems a bit odd because 4000 is 4000, which is 4 thousand. So, $4000 is 4 thousand dollars. Okay, that makes sense.

So, the first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. So, twice $4000. Let me calculate that. Twice of 4000 is 4000 multiplied by 2, which is 8000. So, the second bank gave him $8000.

Now, let's add both contributions together. The first bank gave $4000, and the second bank gave $8000. So, 4000 plus 8000. Let me do that addition. 4000 plus 8000 is 12000. So, the total amount he received from both banks is $12000.

But wait, hold on. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice that, which is $8000. So, 4000 plus 8000 is indeed 12000. So, he received a total of $12000 from both banks.

Now, he initially had $5000 in capital. So, his current capital is his initial capital plus the amount he received from the banks. So, that would be 5000 plus 12000. Let me calculate that. 5000 plus 12000 is 17000. So, his current capital is $17000.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First bank: $4000. Second bank: twice that is $8000. Total from banks: 4000 + 8000 = 12000. Initial capital: 5000. Total capital: 5000 + 12000 = 17000. Yeah, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again. The first bank gave $4000. The second bank gave twice as much, so 2 times 4000 is 8000. Adding those together: 4000 + 8000. Let's add the thousands: 4000 is 4 thousands, 8000 is 8 thousands. 4 + 8 is 12 thousands, which is 12000. So, that's correct. Then, adding that to his initial capital of 5000. 5000 + 12000. Let's add the thousands: 5000 is 5 thousands, 12000 is 12 thousands. 5 + 12 is 17 thousands, which is 17000. So, that's 17000. So, yes, $17000.

Wait, hold on, in the initial problem statement, it says "the first bank gave him $40000, and the second company gave him
