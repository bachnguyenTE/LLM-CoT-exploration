Q: Bob wants to dig a hole 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, how long will it take him to dig the hole?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Bob wants to dig a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. Hmm, I need to figure out how long it will take him to do this. The problem says it takes him 3 seconds to shovel each cubic foot of earth. Alright, so first, I think I need to calculate the volume of the hole because that will tell me how many cubic feet of earth he's shoveling. Then, since each cubic foot takes 3 seconds, I can multiply the number of cubic feet by 3 to get the total time.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is what a hole is. The formula is length multiplied by width multiplied by depth. So, in this case, that would be 6 feet (length) times 4 feet (width) times 3 feet (depth). Let me write that down:

Volume = length × width × depth
Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 3 ft

Hmm, let me compute that. 6 times 4 is 24, and then 24 times 3 is 72. So, the volume is 72 cubic feet. That means Bob has to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth.

Now, each cubic foot takes 3 seconds to shovel. So, to find the total time, I need to multiply the number of cubic feet by the time per cubic foot. So, that would be 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds per cubic foot.

Let me calculate that. 72 times 3 is... 70 times 3 is 210, and 2 times 3 is 6, so 216? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 70 times 3 is 211, and 2 times 3 is 6, so 211 + 6 is 217. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, 72 times 3: 70 times 3 is 210, and 2 times 3 is 6, so 210 + 6 is 216. Yeah, that's right. So, 72 times 3 is 216.

So, the total time is 216 seconds. But the question is asking how long it will take, so I should probably convert that into minutes or hours, but the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's okay to leave it in seconds. But let me check.

Wait, 216 seconds. How many minutes is that? 60 seconds is 1 minute, so 216 divided by 60 is 3.6 minutes. So, 3 minutes and 36 seconds. But the question didn't specify the unit, so maybe it's okay to leave it in seconds. But let me see if the problem expects a specific unit.

Looking back at the problem: "how long will it take him to dig the hole?" It doesn't specify, but since the time per cubic foot is given in seconds, maybe they want the answer in seconds. So, 216 seconds is the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, volume is 6 × 4 × 3. 6 × 4 is 24, 24 × 3 is 72. That's correct. Then, 72 cubic feet, each taking 3 seconds, so 72 × 3 is 216 seconds. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 3 seconds per cubic foot, so 72 cubic feet would take 72 × 3 seconds. 70 × 3 is 210, and 2 × 3 is 6, so 210 + 6 is 216. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think 216 seconds is the right answer. So, I can write that as the final answer.

**Final Answer**
It will take Bob \boxed{216} seconds to dig the hole.

To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is a rectangular prism with dimensions 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. The volume is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 72 \,000 \,000 \,000
