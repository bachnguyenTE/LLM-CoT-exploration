Q: Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost for the first amusement park. There are 2 adults and 2 children. The cost per adult is $26, so 2 adults cost 2 multiplied by $26, which is $52. The cost per child is $12, so 2 children cost 2 multiplied by $12, which is $24. Adding these together, the total cost for the first park is $52 plus $24, totaling $76.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for the second amusement park. The cost per adult is $14, so 2 adults cost 2 multiplied by $14, which is $28. The cost per child is $10, so 2 children cost 2 multiplied by $10, which is $2. Adding these together, the total cost for the second park is $28 plus $2, totaling $30.

Finally, to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, I'll subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park. $76 minus $30 equals $46. Therefore, they can save $46 by choosing the second amusement park.

To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we'll calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost for the First Amusement Park

- **Adult Fee:** \$26 per adult
- **Child Fee:** \$12 per child
- **Number of Adults:** 2
- **Number of Children:** 2

\[
\text{Total Cost for First Park} = (2 \times \$26) + (2 \times \$12) = \$52 + \$24 = \$76
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for the Second Amusement Park

- **Adult Fee:** \$14 per adult
- **Child Fee:** \$10 per child
- **Number of Adults:** 2
- **Number of Children:** 2

\[
\text{Total Cost for Second Park} = (2 \times \$14) + (2 \times \$10) = \$28 + \$20 = \$48
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Savings

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total Cost for First Park} - \text{Total Cost for Second Park} = \$76 - \$48 = \$28
\]

\[
\boxed{28}
