Q: Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.  Assuming his dogs each has four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?

Okay, so Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Each dog has four legs, and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Hmm, let me figure out how much it will cost him in total.

First, I should probably figure out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs. Since each dog has four legs, does that mean he needs four pairs of snowshoes per dog? Or is it two pairs? Wait, no, each pair of snowshoes covers two dogs, right? Because each pair is for one dog, but each dog has four legs. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, no, actually, each pair of snowshoes is for one dog. So if each dog has four legs, does that mean each dog needs four pairs of snowshoes? That seems like a lot. But maybe that's how it is. So each dog needs four pairs of snowshoes, each costing $12.00.

So, for one dog, it's 4 pairs * $12.00 per pair. Let me calculate that. 4 times 12 is 48, so $48.00 per dog. Then, Mario has 6 dogs, so 6 times 48. Let me do that multiplication. 6 times 40 is 240, and 6 times 8 is 48, so 240 + 48 is 296. So, $296.00 in total.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Each dog has four legs, so each dog needs four pairs of snowshoes. Each pair is $12.00, so per dog, it's 4 * 12 = $48.00. Then, 6 dogs would be 6 * 48 = 288. So, $288.00. Hmm, that's different from my first calculation. Wait, 4*12 is 48, so 6 dogs would be 6*48, which is 288. So, $288.00.

Wait, so why did I get 296 before? Maybe I added incorrectly. Let me do 48 * 6 again. 40*6 is 240, and 8*6 is 48, so 240 + 48 is 288. So, $288.00. That makes more sense.

So, Mario needs 4 pairs per dog, 6 dogs, so 24 pairs total. Each pair is $12.00, so 24 * 12. Let me calculate that. 20*12 is 240, and 4*12 is 48, so 240 + 48 is 288. So, $288.00 total.

Wait, but another way to think about it is, each pair of snowshoes covers two dogs, right? Because each pair is for one dog, but each dog has four legs. So, maybe he needs two pairs per dog? Wait, that would be 2 pairs per dog, so 2 * 6 dogs is 12 pairs. Then, 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair is 144, which is $144.00. But that doesn't make sense because each pair is for one dog, not two.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the number of legs with the number of pairs. Each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, but each dog has four legs, so each dog needs four pairs of snowshoes. So, 4 pairs per dog, 6 dogs, 24 pairs. 24 * 12 is 288. So, $288.00.

But wait, another thought: if each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, but each dog has four legs, so each dog needs four pairs. So, 4 pairs per dog, 6 dogs, 24 pairs. 24 * 12 is 288. So, $288.00.

Alternatively, maybe the question is that each pair of snowshoes is for one dog, but each dog has four legs, so each pair is for one dog, but each dog needs four legs, so each dog needs four pairs. So, 4 pairs per dog, 6 dogs, 24 pairs. 24 * 12 is 288. So, $288.00.

Wait, but 24 * 12 is 288,
