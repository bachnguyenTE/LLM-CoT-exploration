Q: Caroline has 4 children.  The first child is 6 feet tall.  The second child is two inches taller than the first child.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.  And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.  How tall is the fourth child, in inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Caroline's four children, and I need to figure out how tall the fourth child is in inches. Let me try to break this down step by step. Sometimes, when I see problems like this, I get a bit overwhelmed, but I think if I take it one piece at a time, it'll make more sense.

First, let me list out what I know:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
3. The third child is five inches shorter than the second child.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.

And the question is asking for the height of the fourth child in inches. Hmm, okay. So, I need to convert all these measurements to inches because the final answer is in inches. That makes sense because the first child's height is given in feet, and the others are in inches, so I should convert the first child's height to inches first.

Alright, so let's start with the first child. They are 6 feet tall. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, to convert feet to inches, I can multiply the number of feet by 12. Let me write that down:

First child's height = 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.

Okay, so the first child is 72 inches tall. Got that down.

Now, moving on to the second child. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. Since the first child is 72 inches, the second child's height would be 72 inches plus 2 inches. Let me calculate that:

Second child's height = 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches.

Alright, so the second child is 74 inches tall. That seems straightforward.

Next up is the third child, who is five inches shorter than the second child. So, the second child is 74 inches, so subtracting 5 inches from that should give me the third child's height. Let me do that:

Third child's height = 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches.

Wait, hold on, 74 minus 5 is 69? Let me double-check that. 74 minus 5 is indeed 69. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the third child is 69 inches tall. Okay, moving on to the fourth child. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. So, the third child is 69 inches, so adding 3 inches to that should give me the fourth child's height.

Fourth child's height = 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches.

Wait a second, that's interesting. The fourth child is 72 inches tall? That's the same as the first child, who was 6 feet tall. So, 72 inches is 6 feet. That seems a bit surprising, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again:

1. First child: 6 feet. Convert to inches: 6 * 12 = 72 inches. That's correct.

2. Second child: 72 + 2 = 74 inches. That's right.

3. Third child: 74 - 5 = 69 inches. Correct.

4. Fourth child: 69 + 3 = 72 inches. Yep, that's 6 feet.

So, all the steps check out. Each child's height is calculated correctly, and the fourth child is indeed 72 inches tall, which is 6 feet. So, that seems consistent.

But just to make sure, let me think about the relationships again. The first child is 6 feet, which is 72 inches. The second is two inches taller, so 74 inches. The third is five inches shorter, so 69 inches. The fourth is three inches taller than the third, so 72 inches. So, yeah, the fourth child is 72 inches tall, which is 6 feet. So, that seems to make sense.

I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step is straightforward, and the conversions are correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

**Final Answer**
The fourth child is \boxed{72} inches tall.

First, convert the height of the first child from feet to inches:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]
