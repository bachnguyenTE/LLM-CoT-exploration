Q: Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. What is the total age of all three of the family members?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Nani, his brother, and his sister, and I need to find the total age of all three of them. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Nani is 8 years old. That's straightforward. So, Nani's age is 8. 

Next, it mentions his brother is twice his age. Hmm, okay. So, if Nani is 8, then his brother's age would be twice that. Let me write that down. 

Brother's age = 2 * Nani's age = 2 * 8 = 16. 

So, the brother is 16 years old. Got that.

Now, the sister is 25% younger than Nani. Hmm, okay. So, if Nani is 8, then 25% of Nani's age is 25% of 8. Let me calculate that. 

25% of 8 is 0.25. So, the sister's age is Nani's age minus 25% of her age. 

Sister's age = Nani's age - 25% of Nani's age = 8 - 0.25 = 7.75. 

Wait, 7.75? That seems a bit unusual, but okay, maybe it's correct. So, the sister is 7.75 years old. 

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, I need to add up Nani's age, his brother's age, and his sister's age. 

Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age = 8 + 16 +7.75. 

Let me add those up. 

First, 8 + 16 is 24. Then, 24 +7.75 is 31.75. 

So, the total age is 31.75 years. 

Wait, 31.75 is the same as 31 years and 9 months, right? Because 0.75 of a year is 9 months. But the question just asks for the total age, so 31.75 is fine. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Nani is 8, brother is 16, sister is 7.75. Adding them together: 8 +16 is 24, plus 7.75 is 31.75? Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 8 +16 is 24, plus 7.75 is 31.75. Wait, no, 24 +7.75 is 31.75? Wait, 24 +7 is 31, and 0.75 is 31.75. Yeah, that's correct. 

Wait, hold on, 8 +16 is 24, and 24 +7.75 is 31.75. So, 31.75 is the total age. 

But 31.75 is 31 years and 9 months, but since the question doesn't specify the format, 31.75 is acceptable. 

Alternatively, if I wanted to write it as a fraction, 0.75 is 3/4, so 31.75 is 31 and 3/4, which is 127/4. But I think 31.75 is fine. 

So, I think that's the answer. 

Wait, let me just make sure I interpreted the sister's age correctly. It says the sister is 25% younger than him. So, 25% of Nani's age is 25% of 8, which is 2. So, 8 - 2 is 6. Wait, hold on, that's different. 

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the sister's age. 

If Nani is 8, 25% of 8 is 0.25, so the sister is 8 - 0.25 = 7.75. So, that's correct. 

But wait, another way to think about it is, 25% younger means the sister's age is 75% of Nani's age. Because if you take away 25%, you're left with 75%. So, 75% of 8 is 0.6. Wait, no, 75% of 8 is 6. So, that's
