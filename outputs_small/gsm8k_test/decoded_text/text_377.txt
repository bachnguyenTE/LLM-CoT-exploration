Q: Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Lucy selling apples. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. 

First, the problem says that Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples she picked. Then on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. And we know that from Monday, she made $56 from selling the apples. The question is asking how many apples she picked over the three days.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to find out how many apples she picked each day and then add them up. But wait, I don't know how many apples she picked on Monday. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I can figure that out first.

She sold all the apples she picked on Monday and made $56. Each apple is sold at $4. So, if she made $56, how many apples did she sell on Monday? Let me write that down.

Let me denote the number of apples she sold on Monday as A. Then, since each apple is $4, the total money made is 4 * A. And that equals $56. So, 4A = 56. To find A, I can divide both sides by 4. So, A = 56 / 4. Let me calculate that. 56 divided by 4 is 14. So, she sold 14 apples on Monday.

Wait, so she sold 14 apples on Monday. But the problem says she sold all the apples she picked on Monday. So, does that mean she picked 14 apples on Monday? Because she sold all of them. So, yes, she picked 14 apples on Monday.

Okay, so Monday: 14 apples.

Then, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. So, Tuesday: 12 apples.

Now, on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. So, the previous day is Tuesday, which was 12 apples. So, double that would be 12 * 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

So, Wednesday: 24 apples.

Now, to find the total number of apples she picked over the three days, I need to add up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

So, that's 14 + 12 + 24. Let me add them step by step.

14 + 12 is 27, but wait, it's 14 + 12. So, 14 + 12 is 26. Then, 26 + 24. Hmm, 26 + 20 is 46, and then +4 is 50. So, total apples picked over three days is 50.

Wait, let me double-check that. 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) +24 (Wednesday). 14 +12 is 26, and 26 +24 is 50. Yeah, that seems right.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. She sold all the apples on Monday for $56, so 14 apples. Then Tuesday, 12 apples, and Wednesday, double Tuesday's amount, which is 24. So, 14 +12 +24 is 50. That seems correct.

Wait, but hold on, the problem says she sold all the apples on Monday, so that's 14. Then, on Tuesday, she picked 12. So, does that mean she had 12 apples on Tuesday? Or did she pick 12 more? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day."

So, "picked 12 apples" on Tuesday, and then "double the number of apples she did the previous day." So, the previous day is Tuesday, so she picked double that, which is 24. So, that seems correct.

So, Monday:14, Tuesday:12, Wednesday:24. Total:50. So, 50 apples.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the number of apples she picked on Tuesday 12, or is that the number she picked on Tuesday, which is 12, and then Wednesday is double that, so 24. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and then on Wednesday, she picked double the number she picked on Tuesday, which is 24. So,
