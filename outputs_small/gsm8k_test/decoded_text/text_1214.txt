Q: Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.  How many diapers does Jordan change per day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jordan and her children. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. Hmm, so each child needs 5 diapers every day. Since there are 2 children, I should multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes each child needs. That makes sense because if each child needs 5, then two children would need 5 times 2. Let me write that down:

Number of diaper changes per day for children = 2 children * 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes per day.

Alright, so the children together require 10 diaper changes each day. Now, the problem also mentions that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, Jordan's wife is responsible for half of what the children need. 

Wait, so if the children need 10 diaper changes per day, and the wife changes half of that, how many does she change? I think I need to calculate half of 10. Let me do that:

Number of diaper changes by Jordan's wife = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.

So, Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers per day. But the question is asking how many diapers Jordan changes per day. Hmm, so does that mean Jordan is responsible for the other half? Because the total is 10, and the wife takes half, so Jordan must take the other half.

Let me confirm that. If the total is 10, and half is 5, then the other half is also 5. So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the total number of diapers is 10, and half of that is 5. So, Jordan is responsible for the other 5. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If each child needs 5, and there are two, that's 10. The wife changes half, so she changes 5, and Jordan changes the other 5. So, yes, Jordan changes 5 per day.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just go through it again.

- Number of children: 2
- diaper changes per child per day:5
- Total diaper changes for children:2*5=10
- Jordan's wife changes half:10/2=5
- Therefore, Jordan changes the other half:10-5=5

Yes, that seems consistent. So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem. It's straightforward: total diaper changes for children, half by the wife, so the other half by Jordan.

**Final Answer**
The number of diapers Jordan changes per day is \boxed{5}.

Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day for the children is calculated as follows:

\[
2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes/child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day}
\]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Thus, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife makes per day is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day}
\]

Since the total number of diaper changes per day is 10, and Jordan's wife changes 5 of them, Jordan must change the remaining 5. Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
