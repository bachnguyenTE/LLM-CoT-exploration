Q: Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here: "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to translate the words into a mathematical equation. The problem says, "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs." Let me break that down. "Four times the number of coffee mugs" would be 4 multiplied by the number of coffee mugs. Let me call the number of coffee mugs "x" to make it easier. So, four times that would be 4x.

Then, "eight more than" that means I add 8 to 4x. So, putting it together, that would be 4x + 8. And the problem states that this equals 40. Wait, 40? Is that 40 or 40? Hmm, maybe it's a typo. Because 40 is just 44, but maybe it's supposed to be 40? Or maybe it's 40 as in 40 something? Wait, no, 40 is just 40. Hmm, maybe it's 40? Let me check the original problem again.

"Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40." So, yeah, it's 40. So, 4x + 8 = 40. Okay, that makes sense.

So, now I have the equation: 4x + 8 = 40. Wait, no, it's 40. So, 4x + 8 = 40. Got it.

Now, I need to solve for x. So, first, I can subtract 8 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. Let me do that.

4x + 8 = 40

Subtract 8 from both sides:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8

Simplifies to:

4x = 32

Okay, so now I have 4x = 32. To solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 4.

4x / 4 = 32 / 4

Which simplifies to:

x = 8

So, x is 8. Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 8 coffee mugs, four times that would be 32. Then, eight more than that is 32 + 8, which is 40. Yeah, that matches the original equation. So, 4x + 8 = 40, with x=8, is correct.

So, I think that's the answer. 8 coffee mugs.

**Final Answer**
The number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \boxed{8}.
</think>

Let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge. The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be translated into the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), first subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:

\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Thus, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \(\boxed{8}\).
