Q: Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dr. Grumpus and his assistant Igor. They were preparing for a lab experiment, and Igor was supposed to gather some items: 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But he messed up and ended up putting some of these items on the lab bench. The total number of items he placed there was 29. I need to figure out how many beakers Igor lost.

Let me try to break this down step by step. First, let's list out what Igor was supposed to gather:

- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes:14

So, the total number of items he was supposed to gather is 16 + 7 + 14. Let me calculate that: 16 + 7 is 23, and 23 +14 is 37. So, he was supposed to have 37 items in total.

But Igor didn't do that. Instead, he ended up with 29 items on the bench. That means he lost some items. The question is asking how many beakers he lost.

But wait, Igor didn't gather all the items correctly. Let me read the problem again to make sure I got all the details right.

Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. But by accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.

So, let me parse this:

1. Test tubes: Igor gathered half as many as requested. So, he was supposed to get 16, but he got half that, which is 8.

2. Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested. So, he was supposed to get 14, but he got 16.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says he gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. So, if he was supposed to get 14, he got 14, which is 10 more than requested. That seems like a lot, but okay.

3. Beakers: He had picked up the correct number, so he got all 7 beakers.

So, let me summarize:

- Test tubes: he got half as many as requested, so 16 / 2 = 8.

- Petri dishes: he got two more than requested, so 14 + 2 = 16.

- Beakers: he got all 7, so 7.

So, the total number of items he placed on the bench is 8 (test tubes) + 7 (beakers) +16 (Petri dishes) = 21. Wait, 8 +7 is 15, plus 16 is 21? That can't be right because 21 is the total he was supposed to have, but he only has 21? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench."

So, perhaps the test tubes and Petri dishes were gathered incorrectly, but the beakers were correct. So, the total number of items he placed on the bench is 29.

So, let's denote:

- Test tubes: he was supposed to get 16, but he got half as many, so 8.

- Petri dishes: he was supposed to get 14, but he got two more, so 16.

- Beakers: he was supposed to get 7, and he got all 7.

So, total items he placed on the bench: 8 +7 +6 =21.

But the problem says the total was 29. So, 21 is less than 29. That doesn't add up. So, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the test tubes and Petri dishes were gathered incorrectly, but the beakers were correct. So, the total number of items he placed on the bench is 29, which is more than the 21 he was supposed to have. So, he must have lost some items.

Wait, but the problem says he lost several on the way. So, he had some items on the bench, but he lost some. So, the total he placed on the bench is 29, which is more than the 21 he was supposed to have. So, he
