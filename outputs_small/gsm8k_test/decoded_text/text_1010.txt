Q: Bethany can run 10 laps on the track in one hour.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.  How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Bethany, Trey, Shaelyn, and Quinn running laps on a track. I need to figure out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. That seems straightforward. So, Bethany's lap rate is 10 laps per hour. I'll note that down.

Next, it says Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany. So, if Bethany does 10 laps, Trey does 10 plus 4. Let me calculate that: 10 + 4 = 14. So, Trey can run 14 laps in an hour. Got it.

Then, Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. Hmm, half of 14. Let me do that division: 14 divided by 2 is 7. So, Shaelyn can run 7 laps in an hour. Okay, that makes sense.

Finally, Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. So, if Shaelyn does 7 laps, subtract 2. That gives me 7 - 2 = 5. So, Quinn can run 5 laps in an hour. Alright, so now I have all their lap rates:

- Bethany: 10 laps/hour
- Trey: 14 laps/hour
- Shaelyn: 7 laps/hour
- Quinn: 5 laps/hour

The question is asking how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. So, I need to find the difference between Bethany's lap rate and Quinn's lap rate.

Let me subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5. That equals 5. So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn in an hour.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Bethany is 10, Trey is 14, which is 4 more. Then, half of 14 is 7, so Shaelyn is 7. Then, 2 fewer than 7 is 5, so Quinn is 5. Subtracting 5 from 10 gives 5. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the answer should be 5 more laps.

**Final Answer**
The number of more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn is \boxed{5}.

Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, which is \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which is \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, which is \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

To find how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's lap rate from Bethany's lap rate: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

The number of more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn is \(\boxed{5}\).
