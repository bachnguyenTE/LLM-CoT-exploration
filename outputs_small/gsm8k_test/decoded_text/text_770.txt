Q: A perfume company is trying to create new scents. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of vanilla scents sold. The company has 4 different vanilla scents, and they sold 5 of each. So, I'll multiply the number of vanilla scents by the number sold per scent.

Next, I'll do the same for the fruity scents. There are 8 different fruity scents, and they sold 2 of each. I'll multiply the number of fruity scents by the number sold per scent to find the total fruity scents sold.

After calculating both totals, I'll subtract the total number of fruity scents sold from the total number of vanilla scents sold to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:**
   
   - Number of vanilla scents available: 4
   - Number of each vanilla scent sold: 5
   
   \[
   \text{Total vanilla scents sold} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:**
   
   - Number of fruity scents available: 8
   - Number of each fruity scent sold: 2
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruity scents sold} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents:**
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total vanilla scents sold} - \text{Total fruity scents sold} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
