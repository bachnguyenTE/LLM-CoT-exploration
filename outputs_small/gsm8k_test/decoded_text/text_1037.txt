Q: The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.  Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.  Is she starts with $50 cash, how much money, in dollars, will she have left to buy meat?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and I need to figure out how much money Mooro has left after buying some cheese. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Mooro buys 2 pounds of it. Then, the price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Mooro buys 3 pounds of that. Mooro starts with $50 cash, and we need to find out how much money she has left to buy meat.

Alright, so I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys. That means I need to find out how much 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese cost and how much 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese cost, then add those two amounts together. After that, I can subtract the total cost from her initial $50 to find out how much she has left.

Let me write this down to make it clearer.

First, the cost of Parmesan cheese:
- Price per pound: $11
- Quantity bought: 2 pounds
- Total cost: 2 pounds * $11 per pound

Hmm, 2 times 1 is 2, so that's $2 for the Parmesan cheese.

Now, the cost of Mozzarella cheese:
- Price per pound: $6
- Quantity bought: 3 pounds
- Total cost: 3 pounds * $6 per pound

Calculating that, 3 times 6 is 18, so that's $18 for the Mozzarella cheese.

Now, to find the total amount Mooro spends on cheese, I need to add the cost of Parmesan and Mozzarella together.

Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella
Total cost = $2 + $18
Total cost = $20

So, Mooro spends a total of $20 on cheese. She started with $50, so to find out how much she has left, I subtract the total cost from her initial amount.

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $50 - $20
Money left = $30

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the Parmesan: 2 pounds at $11 each. 2*11 is indeed 22, which is $2. That seems right.

Then, Mozzarella: 3 pounds at $6 each. 3*6 is 18, so that's $18. Adding $2 and $18 gives $20. Subtracting that from $50, we get $30. Hmm, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. The problem says she starts with $50 cash, so I assume that's her total money before buying anything. So, she spends $20 on cheese, so she has $30 left. That makes sense.

Is there any chance I misread the quantities or the prices? Let me check again.

- Parmesan: $11 per pound, 2 pounds. 2*11=2. Correct.
- Mozzarella: $6 per pound, 3 pounds. 3*6=18. Correct.
- Total: 2+18=20. Correct.
- Initial: 50. 50-20=30. Correct.

I think that's solid. So, Mooro has $30 left to buy meat.

**Final Answer**
Mooro will have \boxed{30} dollars left to buy meat.

Mooro buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound and 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we calculate the total cost of the cheese and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
\[
2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11 \text{ per pound} = \$2
\]

Next, calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
\[
3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18
\]

Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
\[
\$2 + \$18 = \$20
\]

Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Mooro has:
\[
\$50 - \$20 = \$30
\]

Thus, Mooro will have \boxed{30} dollars left to buy meat.
