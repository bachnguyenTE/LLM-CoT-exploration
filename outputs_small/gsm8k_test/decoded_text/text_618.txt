Q: The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. How many students were there in the school auditorium?

Okay, so I have this problem about the school auditorium with 4 rows of seats. Each row has 18 seats. Then, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. After that, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, and the rest were occupied by the students. I need to find out how many students were there in the auditorium. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows, each with 18 seats. So, I can calculate the total seats by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row. That would be 4 times 18. Let me write that down:

Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

Okay, so there are 72 seats in total. Now, one-fourth of these seats were occupied by the administrators. I need to find out how many seats that is. To find one-fourth, I can divide the total number of seats by 4.

Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 ÷ 4 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. That means the remaining seats are 72 minus 18. Let me calculate that:

Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Alright, so 54 seats are left after the administrators. Now, one-third of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents. I need to find out how many seats that is. To do this, I can take the remaining seats and divide by 3.

Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 ÷ 3 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents. Now, the rest of the seats must be occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, I can subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Wait, let me double-check that. If 54 seats were left after the administrators, and 18 were occupied by the parents, then 54 -18 is indeed 36. So, 36 seats are occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of students in the auditorium is 36.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.

Total seats: 4 rows ×18 seats =72. That seems right.

One-fourth occupied by administrators: 72 ÷4=18. That's correct.

Remaining seats:72 -18=54. That's correct.

One-third of the remaining seats occupied by parents:54 ÷3=18. That's correct.

Remaining seats for students:54 -18=36. That's correct.

So, yes, 36 students. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using fractions or something else.

Alternatively, I can think of the total seats as 72. The administrators occupy 1/4, which is 18 seats. Then, the parents occupy 1/3 of the remaining 3/4 of the seats. So, the parents occupy (1/3) × (3/4) ×72.

Let me compute that:

(1/3) × (3/4) ×72 = (1/4) ×72 =18. So, parents occupy 18 seats, which matches what I found earlier.

Then, the students would be the remaining 2/4 of the seats, which is 2/4 ×72=36. Wait, that's 36? Wait, no, that can't be right because 1/4 +1/3 + something else.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me see.

Wait, actually, the parents are taking 1/3 of the remaining seats after the administrators. So, the remaining seats after the administrators are 3/4 of 72, which is 54. Then, parents take 1/3 of 54, which is 18. So, 54 -18=36. So, 36 students. Wait, that's 36? Wait, 54 -18 is 36, not 36. Wait, 54 -18 is 36? No, 54 -18 is 36? Wait, 54 -18 is 36? Wait, 54 -18 is 36?
