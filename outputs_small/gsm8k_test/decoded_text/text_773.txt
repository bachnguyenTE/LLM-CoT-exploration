Q: Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, and he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. He kept the remaining pencils. How many pencils did Anthony keep?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Anthony and his pencils. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Anthony had 50 pencils. Hmm, wait, 50 pencils? That seems like a lot, but okay, maybe it's a typo or maybe it's intentional. Anyway, let's go with 50 pencils.

He gave half of his pencils to Brandon. So, half of 50 pencils. Let me calculate that. Half of 50 is 25, right? Because 50 divided by 2 is 25. So, he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. 

Now, after giving 25 pencils to Brandon, how many does he have left? Let me subtract that from the original number. So, 50 minus 25 is 30. So, he has 33 pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. Hmm, okay. So, he has 33 pencils left, and he's giving 3/5 of that to Charlie. Let me figure out how many that is. 

To find 3/5 of 33, I can multiply 33 by 3 and then divide by 5. So, 33 times 3 is 99, and 99 divided by 5 is... let me see, 5 goes into 99 how many times? 5 times 19 is 95, so that's 19 with a remainder of 4. So, 99 divided by 5 is 19.8. Wait, but pencils can't be in fractions, right? So, does that mean he gave 19 pencils or 20 pencils? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but I think it's okay to have a decimal here because it's just a fraction. So, 19.8 pencils. Hmm, but maybe I should keep it as a fraction instead of a decimal. 

Wait, 3/5 of 33 is 99/5, which is 19 and 4/5. So, 19 and 4/5 pencils. Hmm, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I should think of it as 19 pencils and 4/5 of a pencil. But since you can't really have a fraction of a pencil, maybe the problem expects an exact answer, so perhaps 19.8 is acceptable? Or maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. 33 divided by 5 is 6.6? No, wait, 33 divided by 5 is 6.6? No, that's not right. Wait, 5 times 6 is 30, so 33 minus 30 is 3, so 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So, 6.6 pencils? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 33 divided by 5 is 6.6. Wait, no, 5 times 6 is 30, so 33 minus 30 is 3, so 3 divided by 5 is 0.6. So, 6.6 pencils. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe I should think of it as 6 and 3/5 pencils. So, 6 pencils and 3/5 of a pencil. But again, that's a fraction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as 33 divided by 5 is 6.6, so 6.6 pencils. But that's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go back.

He had 50 pencils. He gave half to Brandon, so 25 pencils. So, 50 minus 25 is 25. Wait, hold on, 50 minus 25 is 30? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 30? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, no, 50 minus 25 is 45? Wait, no, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, no, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 45? Wait, no, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, no, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 25? Wait, 50 minus 25 is 25, so 50 minus 25 is 25
