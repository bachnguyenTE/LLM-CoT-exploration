Q: Carla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?

Okay, so Carla has just given birth to identical octuplets. That's interesting because octuplets are usually just one or two, but identical means they look and behave the same. Anyway, she dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. So, out of eight babies, six are purple and two are blue. Hmm, wait, no, octuplets are usually eight, but identical means they are all the same, so maybe she has eight babies? Yeah, that makes sense. So, 3/4 of eight is six, and 1/4 is two. So, six purple and two blue.

Now, the problem says that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, I need to figure out the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. So, in other words, given that a baby is wearing a bow, what's the probability that they're purple?

This sounds like a conditional probability problem. So, I can use Bayes' theorem or maybe just basic probability concepts. Let me think.

First, let's define the events:

- Let P be the event that a baby is purple.
- Let B be the event that a baby wears a bow.

We need to find P(P | B), the probability that a baby is purple given that they wear a bow.

Bayes' theorem says that P(P | B) = P(B | P) * P(P) / P(B)

So, I need to find P(B | P), which is the probability that a purple baby wears a bow. The problem says that all blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows. So, if a baby is blue, they wear a bow for sure. If a baby is purple, they wear a bow with probability 1/3.

So, P(B | P) = 1/3.

P(P) is the probability that a baby is purple. Since she has six purple and two blue out of eight, P(P) = 6/8 = 3/4.

Now, P(B) is the total probability that a baby wears a bow. This can happen in two ways: either the baby is blue and wears a bow, or the baby is purple and wears a bow.

So, P(B) = P(B | P) * P(P) + P(B | not P) * P(not P)

We already know P(B | P) =1/3 and P(not P) = 1 - P(P) = 1 - 3/4 =1/4.

P(B | not P) is the probability that a non-purple baby wears a bow. The problem says that only 1/3 of the purple wearers wear a bow, so does that mean that 1/3 of all purple wearers wear a bow? Wait, no, the problem says "all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows." So, it's 1/3 of the purple wearers, not 1/3 of all purple wearers. So, P(B | not P) =1/3.

Therefore, P(B) = (1/3)*(3/4) + (1/3)*(1/4) = (1/3)*(3/4 +1/4) = (1/3)*(1) =1/3.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check.

Wait, no, actually, P(B | not P) is 1/3, but P(not P) is 1/4. So, P(B | not P) * P(not P) is (1/3)*(1/4) =1/12.

Similarly, P(B | P) * P(P) is (1/3)*(3/4)=1/4.

So, P(B) =1/4 +1/12= (3/12 +1/12)=4/12=1/3.

Yes, that's correct. So, P(B)=1/3.

So, now, going back to Bayes' theorem:

P(P | B)= (1/3)*(3/4) / (1/3)= (1/4)/(1/3)= (1/4)*(3/1)=3/4=0.75=75%.

Wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

So, the probability that a baby is purple given that they wear a bow is 75%. That seems correct because more of the purple wearers wear a bow, but only 1/3 of them. So, the total probability of wearing a bow is 1/3 of purple and 1/3 of blue, which is 1/3 of each group.

But since there are more purple babies,
