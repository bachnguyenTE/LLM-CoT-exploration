Q: Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class as a special treat. He's not sure if people will want vanilla or chocolate cupcakes so he decides to get one of each for everyone. If he gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of people Howie is buying cupcakes for. This includes Howie himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of cupcakes by multiplying the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person will receive. Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, I'll multiply the total number of people by 2.

Finally, I'll provide the final answer to show how many cupcakes Howie should buy.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of people:**
   - Howie
   - His teacher
   - His 25 classmates

   So, the total number of people is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:**
   - Each person gets **2 cupcakes**.
   - Total cupcakes = Number of people × Number of cupcakes per person
   \[
   \text{Total cupcakes} = 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{54}
\]
