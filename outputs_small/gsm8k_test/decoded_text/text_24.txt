Q: Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50. This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?

Okay, so Kyle bought a book last year, and it was one of the best-selling ones. Now, he's seeing it for $19.50, and that's after a 25% discount from the original price. Hmm, I need to figure out what the original price was before the discount. 

Alright, let me think about this. If the book is on sale for 25% off, that means Kyle is paying 75% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 25% is 75%. So, $19.50 is 75% of the original price. I guess I can set up an equation to solve for the original price.

Let me denote the original price as "P." So, 75% of P is equal to $19.50. In mathematical terms, that would be 0.75 * P = 19.50. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 0.75. So, P = 19.50 / 0.75. 

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. If 75% is 0.75, then yes, dividing by 0.75 should give me the original price. Okay, so let me do that division. 19.50 divided by 0.75. Hmm, I can do this by converting the decimals to fractions or just do the division as is.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 19.50 divided by 0.75. Maybe I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals. So, 19.50 * 100 is 1950, and 0.75 * 100 is 75. So now, it's 1950 divided by 75. Let me compute that.

1950 divided by 75. Hmm, 75 goes into 1950 how many times? Let me see. 75 times 20 is 1500. Subtract that from 1950, and I get 450. Then, 75 goes into 450 six times because 75*6 is 450. So, adding that up, 20 + 6 is 26. So, 1950 divided by 75 is 26. So, P is $26. 

Wait, let me check that. If the original price was $26, then a 25% discount would be 0.25 * 26, which is $6.50. Subtracting that from $26 gives $19.50, which matches what Kyle paid. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 25% off means you're paying 75% of the original price. So, 75% of P is $19.50. So, P = 19.50 / 0.75. Let me compute that. 19.50 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So, 19.50 * (4/3). 

Let me compute that. 19.50 divided by 3 is 6.50, and then multiplied by 4 is 26. So, again, I get $26. So, that's consistent. 

Wait, another way to think about it is using fractions. 25% is 1/4, so the discount is 1/4, meaning the customer pays 3/4 of the original price. So, 3/4 of P is $19.50. So, P = 19.50 / (3/4) = 19.50 * (4/3). 

Calculating that, 19.50 * 4 is 78.20, and then divided by 3 is approximately 26.06666... So, that's $26.67 when rounded to the nearest cent. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I got exactly $26. So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the decimal places. Let me recalculate 19.50 divided by 0.75. So, 19.50 divided by 0.75. Let me write it as 19.50 / 0.
