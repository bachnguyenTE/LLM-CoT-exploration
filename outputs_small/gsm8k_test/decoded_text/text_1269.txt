Q: Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Elvis driving. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the problem says Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. He was driving at an average speed of 18 mph for both parts of the journey. I need to find out how far he is from his house now.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, Elvis is driving west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and goes east for 8 hours. Both times, his speed is 18 mph. So, I guess I need to calculate the distance he traveled west and then the distance he traveled east, and then see the difference between those two distances because he turned around.

Wait, so when he turns around, he's going back the opposite direction, which is east. So, he went west for 5 hours at 18 mph, and then east for 8 hours at 18 mph. So, the total distance west is 5 hours multiplied by 18 mph, and the total distance east is 8 hours multiplied by 18 mph.

Let me write that down. Distance = speed × time. So, for the westward journey: 18 mph × 5 hours. Let me calculate that. 18 times 5 is 90. So, he's 90 miles west of his house.

Then, for the eastward journey: 18 mph × 8 hours. 18 times 8 is 144. So, he's 144 miles east of his house.

Wait, so he went 90 miles west and then 144 miles east. So, to find out how far he is from his house, I need to subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance because he's moving away from his house in the east direction.

So, 144 miles east minus 90 miles west. That would be 144 - 90. Let me do that subtraction. 144 minus 90 is 54. So, he is 54 miles east of his house now.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. So, 18 mph for 5 hours is 90 miles west, and 18 mph for 8 hours is 144 miles east. So, the total distance from his house is 144 - 90, which is 54 miles. Yeah, that seems right.

But hold on, is it 54 miles east or 54 miles west? Hmm, no, because he turned around and went east, so he's east of his house. So, 54 miles east. So, the answer should be 54 miles.

Wait, but let me think again. So, he went west for 5 hours, so that's 90 miles west. Then he turned around and went east for 8 hours, so that's 144 miles east. So, the net distance from his starting point is 144 - 90, which is 54 miles east. So, yeah, 54 miles.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total distance he traveled west and east. So, 5 hours west and 8 hours east. So, the total distance is 5 + 8 =13 hours. But since he went west and then east, the net distance is the difference between the two times multiplied by speed.

So, 8 -5 =3 hours. So, 3 hours ×18 mph =24 miles. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, no, that approach is wrong because the direction matters. So, if he went west for 5 hours and then east for 8 hours, the net distance is eastward because he went further east than west. So, the net distance is 8 -5 =3 hours ×18 mph =54 miles. So, that's consistent with my first calculation.

So, the net distance is 54 miles east. So, the answer is 54 miles.

Wait, but in my first approach, I thought of the total distance as 90 miles west and 144 miles east, so 144 -90=54. So, same answer.

So, both methods give me 54 miles. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think about the units. 5 hours ×18 mph is 90 miles, which is west. 8 hours ×18 mph is 144 miles, which is east. So, the difference is 144 -90=54 miles east.

So, yeah, 54 miles east
