Q: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. Then, each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. I need to figure out how long each final piece will be. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, Marty has 100 cm of ribbon. He wants to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, I think that means he's going to divide the ribbon into 4 sections, each of the same length. To find out how long each of those parts will be, I should divide the total length by the number of parts. So, that would be 100 cm divided by 4. Let me write that down:

100 cm ÷ 4 = ?

Hmm, 100 divided by 4. Well, 4 goes into 10 two times because 4 times 2 is 8, and that leaves a remainder of 2. Then, bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times because 4 times 5 is 20. So, putting that together, it's 25 cm. So, each of the 4 parts will be 25 cm long. Let me double-check that: 4 times 25 is 100, which is correct. Okay, so that part makes sense.

Now, the next step is that each of those 25 cm pieces needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, each 25 cm piece is going to be cut into 5 smaller pieces. So, I need to find the length of each of those smaller pieces. That means I have to divide 25 cm by 5. Let me write that down:

25 cm ÷ 5 = ?

Well, 5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times because 5 times 5 is 25. So, each of those smaller pieces will be 5 cm long. Let me verify that: 5 times 5 is 25, which is correct. So, that seems right.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, "Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts." So, does that mean that after cutting into 4 parts, each of those parts is then cut into 5 equal parts? So, each of the 4 parts is further divided into 5, making it 4 times 5, which is 20 pieces in total? But the question is asking for the length of each final cut, so each of those 20 pieces is 5 cm long. Hmm, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again: "Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?" So, yeah, it's 100 cm, cut into 4 equal parts, each of those 4 parts is then cut into 5 equal parts. So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm, and each of those is cut into 5, so each final piece is 5 cm. So, the answer is 5 cm.

But wait, let me think about the wording again. It says, "each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts." So, does that mean that each of the 4 parts is divided into 5, so each of the 4 parts is split into 5, making 20 pieces? But the question is asking for the length of each final cut. So, each final cut is 5 cm. So, yeah, that seems to be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that he cuts the ribbon into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts is cut into 5 equal parts, so each final piece is 5 cm. So, yeah, that seems to be the case.

Wait, but let me think about the process. So, first, he cuts 100 cm into 4 equal parts. So, each part is 25 cm. Then, he takes each 25 cm piece and cuts it into 5 equal parts. So, each of those 5 parts is 5 cm. So, each final piece is 5 cm. So, the answer is 5 cm.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as a single division. So, 100 cm divided by 4, then divided by 5. So, 100 divided by 4
