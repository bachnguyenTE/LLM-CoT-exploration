Q: The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?

Okay, so I have this problem here about the Doubtfire sisters and their kittens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter. So, that's 7 kittens already. Then, their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. 

Now, it mentions that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Hmm, so Patchy has had three times as many as the 7 kittens that were already adopted. That means I need to multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many kittens Patchy has now.

Let me write that down: 7 kittens adopted, and Patchy has had 3 times that. So, 7 multiplied by 3 is... 21? Wait, 7 times 3 is 21? Yeah, that's right. So, Patchy has 21 kittens now.

Then, it says Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens. So, Trixie has 12 kittens. 

Now, the question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfire family now has. So, we need to add up all the kittens that were adopted and the kittens that were adopted by the two cats.

So, the initial 7 kittens plus Patchy's 21 kittens plus Trixie's 12 kittens. Let me add those up.

First, 7 plus 21 is... 28. Then, 28 plus 12 is... 40. So, altogether, the family now has 40 kittens.

Wait, let me double-check that. 7 + 21 is 28, and 28 + 12 is 40. Yeah, that seems right. So, 40 kittens in total.

I think that's it. So, the answer should be 40.

The Doubtfire family initially had 7 kittens adopted. Patchy, the first house cat, had thrice that number, which is 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens. Adding all these together: 7 + 21 + 12 = 40. 

**Answer:** The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.
