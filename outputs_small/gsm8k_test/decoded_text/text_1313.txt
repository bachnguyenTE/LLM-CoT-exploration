Okay, so I have this problem here: A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. So, I guess I need to find out how much he bought each watermelon for initially. Then, since he sold them at a 25% profit, I can figure out the selling price per watermelon.

Alright, let's break it down. If he bought 50 watermelons for $80, then the cost per watermelon must be the total cost divided by the number of watermelons. So, that would be $80 divided by 50. Let me write that down:

Cost per watermelon = Total cost / Number of watermelons
Cost per watermelon = $80 / 50

Hmm, let me calculate that. 80 divided by 50. Well, 50 goes into 88 sixteen times because 55 times 1 is 55, 55 times 2 is 110, which is too much. So, 16 times 55 is 880? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 55 times 1 is 55, 55 times 1.6 is 88. So, 55 times 1.6 is 88. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 80 divided by 55 is 1.6? Wait, no, 88 is 1.6, but 88 is 88, so 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88 divided by 55 is 1.6. So, 88
