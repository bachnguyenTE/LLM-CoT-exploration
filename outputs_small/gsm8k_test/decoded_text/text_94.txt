Q: In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about rabbits, dogs, and cats in a neighborhood. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but I think if I break it down, I can handle it.

First, the problem says: "In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats." Hmm, okay. So, rabbits are equal to (number of dogs + number of cats) minus twelve. Let me write that down as an equation.

Let me denote:
- R = number of rabbits
- D = number of dogs
- C = number of cats

So, according to the problem, R = (D + C) - 12. Got that.

Next, it says: "If there are two cats for every dog." So, the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1. That means for every dog, there are two cats. So, if I know the number of dogs, I can find the number of cats by multiplying by 2. Let me write that as another equation.

C = 2 * D. Okay, so cats are twice the number of dogs.

Then, it says: "the number of dogs is 60." So, D = 60. That's straightforward.

So, now I can substitute D = 60 into the equation for cats. So, C = 2 * 60. Let me calculate that. 2 times 60 is 120. So, C = 120. So, there are 120 cats.

Now, going back to the first equation: R = (D + C) - 12. I can substitute D and C with 60 and 120 respectively.

So, R = (60 + 120) -12. Let me compute 60 +120 first. 60 +120 is 180. Then, subtract 12 from that. 180 -12 is 168. So, R = 168.

Wait, so rabbits are 168, dogs are 60, cats are 120. Let me check if that makes sense.

First, the number of cats is twice the number of dogs: 2*60=120. That's correct.

Second, the number of rabbits is (60 +120) -12. 60+120 is 180, minus 12 is 168. That seems right.

So, total number of pets would be rabbits + dogs + cats. So, 168 +60 +120. Let me add those up.

168 +60 is 228, and 228 +120 is 348. So, total pets are 348.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, D=60, C=2*60=120. Then, R=(60+120)-12=180-12=168. Then, total pets:168+60+120=348. Yeah, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me go through the problem again.

Number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, rabbits = (dogs + cats) -12. That's correct.

Number of cats is two for every dog, so cats = 2*dogs. So, if dogs are 60, cats are 120. Then, rabbits are (60+120)-12=168. So, total pets:168+60+120=348.

Wait, 168+60 is 228, plus 120 is 348. Yeah, that's correct.

I think that's solid. So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

**Final Answer**
The total number of pets in the neighborhood is \boxed{348}.

Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits, \( D \) be the number of dogs, and \( C \) be the number of cats.
2. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
   \[
   R = (D + C) - 12
   \]
3. There are two cats for every dog, so the ratio of cats to
