Q: Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Carmen going to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and there are 3 other people who each bid once. Carmen bids after each of these 3 people and eventually wins. I need to figure out how much the desk costs her in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. The initial bid is $200, and then each subsequent bid increases by $50. So, the bids go like $200, $250, $300, and so on. There are 3 other people who each bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them. So, that means Carmen will have 4 bids: the initial $200, then $250, then $300, and then $350. But wait, she wins, so she must have the highest bid. So, the total amount she pays for the desk is the sum of all her bids.

Wait, let me make sure. The initial bid is $200, then each subsequent bid is $50 higher. So, the bids would be:

1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $250
3. Third bid: $300
4. Fourth bid: $350
5. Fifth bid: $400
6. Sixth bid: $450
7. Seventh bid: $500
