Q: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Seth and his stickers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but if I break them down, I can manage them.

First, the problem says: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Then, Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. The question is, how many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. Maybe I can represent the number of stickers each person has with variables. Let's say Seth starts with S stickers. That seems like a good starting point.

So, Seth gives half of his stickers to Luis. That means Luis gets S/2 stickers. So, after that, Seth has S/2 left, right? Because he gave away half.

Now, moving on to Luis. He used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Wait, so Luis had S/2 stickers, and he used half of them. So, how much did he use? Half of S/2 is (1/2)*(S/2) = S/4. So, Luis used S/4 stickers, and the rest he gave to Kris. The rest would be the other half, which is also S/4. So, Luis gave S/4 stickers to Kris.

So, now, let's see how many stickers each person has. Luis has S/4, and he gave S/4 to Kris. So, after that, Luis has S/4 left. Then, Kris received S/4 from Luis and then kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, let's break that down.

Kris received S/4 from Luis. Then, he kept 9 stickers for himself and gave 7 to Rob. So, the total number of stickers Kris has is 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. But wait, that's the amount he kept and gave away. So, the S/4 he received must be equal to 16. Because he used all of his received stickers, right? He used half and gave the other half to Kris. Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, when Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, he used half of what he received and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis had S/2 stickers. He used half of that, which is S/4, and gave the other half, which is also S/4, to Kris. So, that means Luis gave S/4 to Kris. So, after that, Luis has S/4 left, and he gave S/4 to Kris.

So, now, moving on to Kris. Kris received S/4 from Luis. Then, he kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob. So, the total number of stickers Kris has is 9 + 7 = 16. But wait, that 16 is the amount he kept and gave away. So, that means the S/4 he received must be equal to 16. Because he used all of his received stickers, right? He used half and gave half to Kris. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, he used half of what he received, which was S/4, and gave the other half, which is also S/4, to Kris. So, actually, the S/4 he received is equal to the amount he gave to Kris, which is S/4. So, that doesn't make sense because he kept 9 and gave 7, so total 16. So, S/4 must be equal to 16. So, S/4 = 16. Therefore, S = 16*4 = 64.

Wait, so does that mean Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning? Let me check that again because sometimes these problems can be confusing.

So, let's go through it step by step.

1. Seth starts with S stickers.
2. He gives half to Luis: so Luis gets S/2, and Seth has S/2 left.
3. Luis uses half of his S/2 stickers, so he uses (1/2)*(S/2) = S/4. So, he gives S/4 to Kris.
4. So, Luis has S/4 left, and he gives S/4 to Kris.
5. Now, Kris receives S/4 from Luis.
6. Kris keeps 9 and gives 7 to Rob. So, total he has is 9 + 7 = 16.
7. Therefore, the S/4 he received must be equal to 16, because he used all of his received stickers. So, S/4 = 16, so S =
