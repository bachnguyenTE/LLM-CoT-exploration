Q: To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 15 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jane wanting to be promoted to the next school year. The requirement is that she needs to score a total of at least 42 points across three tests. Let me try to figure out what she needs to score on her third test.

First, let me break down the information given. Jane has taken three tests, and the sum of all three tests must be at least 42 points. That means if I add up her scores from the first, second, and third tests, the total should be 42 or more. So, mathematically, I can represent this as:

Test 1 + Test 2 + Test 3 ≥ 42

Now, I know her scores on the first two tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, I can plug those numbers into the equation. Let me write that out:

15 (Test 1) + 18 (Test 2) + Test 3 ≥ 42

Let me add the first two tests together. 15 plus 18 is... hmm, 15 plus 10 is 26, and then 18 minus 10 is 7, so 26 plus 7 is 33. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it more carefully. 15 plus 18: 10 plus 10 is 20, and 5 plus 8 is 13, so 20 plus 13 is 33. Yeah, that's correct. So, 15 + 18 is 33.

So now, the equation simplifies to:

33 + Test 3 ≥ 42

Okay, so I need to find the minimum number of points she needs on the third test. That means I need to solve for Test 3. To do that, I can subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality to isolate Test 3.

So, subtracting 33 from both sides:

Test 3 ≥ 42 - 33

Let me compute 42 minus 33. 42 minus 30 is 12, and then minus 3 more is 9. So, 42 - 33 is 9.

Therefore, Test 3 must be greater than or equal to 9. So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

Wait, let me double-check that. If she scores 9 on the third test, then her total would be 15 + 18 + 9. Let me add those up: 15 + 18 is 33, plus 9 is 42. So, 42 points in total, which meets the requirement of at least 42 points. If she scores less than 9, say 8, then 15 + 18 + 8 is 41, which is less than 42, so she wouldn't pass. So, 9 is the minimum she needs to score on the third test.

I think that makes sense. So, the answer is 9.

**Final Answer**
The minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is \boxed{9}.

Jane needs to score a total of at least 42 points across three tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. To find the minimum score she needs on the third test, we set up the inequality:

\[ 15 + 18 + \text{Test 3} \geq 42 \]

Adding the scores of the first two tests:

\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

This simplifies the inequality to:

\[ 33 + \text{Test 3} \geq 42 \]

Subtracting 33 from both sides:

\[ \text{Test 3} \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Test 3} \geq 9 \]

Thus, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is \boxed{9}.
