Q: Brian's basement was damp and musty, so he bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture out of the air.  The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high.   Brian tested the device's efficiency and he found that the low setting removes 1 liter of water out of the air per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.  If Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting, what is the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement, in liters?

Okay, so I have this problem about Brian and his dehumidifier. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Brian bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture. The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high. He tested it and found out how much water each setting removes per day. 

It says that the low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Then, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting. Hmm, so if the low is 1 liter, medium must be 2 liters per day. Then, the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting. So, if medium is 2 liters, high must be 4 liters per day. Let me write that down:

- Low: 1 liter/day
- Medium: 2 liters/day
- High: 4 liters/day

Okay, that makes sense. So each higher setting removes twice the water of the previous one.

Now, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting. I need to find the total amount of water removed over all these days.

Let me break it down day by day.

First, 3 days on low setting. Each day, it removes 1 liter. So, for 3 days, that's 3 * 1 = 3 liters.

Then, he ran it for 3 more days on the medium setting. Each day, medium removes 2 liters. So, 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters.

Then, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting. Each day, high removes 4 liters. So, 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters.

Now, to find the total water removed, I need to add up all these amounts.

So, 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 3 + 6 + 20.

Let me compute that: 3 + 6 is 9, and 9 + 20 is 29.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, low: 3 days *1 =3, medium:3 days*2=6, high:5 days*4=20. Total:3+6=9, 9+20=29. Hmm, 29 liters total.

Wait, but 29 seems a bit low. Let me think again.

Wait, 3 days on low: 3 liters. 3 days on medium: 3*2=6 liters. 5 days on high:5*4=20 liters. So, 3+6=9, 9+20=29. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but 29 liters over 11 day? That seems really low. Maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

"Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting."

So, 3 days low, 3 days medium, 5 days high. So, 3+3+5=11 days total. So, 29 liters over 11 days. Hmm, 29 liters in 11 day? That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, 1 liter per day on low, 2 per day on medium, 4 per day on high. So, 3 days low: 3 liters, 3 days medium:6 liters, 5 days high:20 liters. So, 3+6+20=29 liters. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but 29 liters in 11 days? That's about 2.6 liters per day on average. But the dehumidifier is removing 1, 2, and 4 liters per day on low, medium, high. So, 29 liters over 11 day is correct.

Wait, but 29 liters in 11 day? That seems low, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again.

Wait, 3 days low: 3 liters. 3 days medium:6 liters. 5 days high:20 liters. So, 3+6=9, 9+20=29. So, 29 liters total.

Wait, but 29 liters in 11 days? That's 2.6 liters per day. But the dehumidifier is removing 1, 2, and 4 liters per day on low,
