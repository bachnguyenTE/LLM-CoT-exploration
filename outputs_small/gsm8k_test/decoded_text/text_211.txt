Q: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jerry and his flock of chickens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Jerry has a flock of chickens. These chickens are either red or white. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs. Also, it mentions that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. The question is asking how many red chickens Jerry has.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I can set up some equations here. Let me denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. 

From the problem, I know two things:

1. The total number of eggs produced per day is 42. Since red chickens produce 3 eggs each and white chickens produce 5 eggs each, the total eggs can be represented as 3R + 5W = 42.

2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens. So, W = R + 2.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 3R + 5W = 42
2. W = R + 2

Since the second equation gives me W in terms of R, I can substitute this into the first equation to solve for R. Let me do that.

Substituting W = R + 2 into the first equation:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Let me simplify this step by step. First, distribute the 5 into (R + 2):

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

Now, combine like terms. 3R + 5R is 8R:

8R + 10 = 42

Wait, hold on, 5 times 2 is 10, right? So, 3R + 5R is 8R, and 5*2 is 10. So, 8R + 10 = 42? Wait, no, 5*(R + 2) is 5R +10, so 3R +5R +10 = 42.

So, 8R +10 = 42.

Wait, 8R +10 =42? That seems off because 10 is on the left and 42 is on the right. Let me check my substitution again.

Wait, 3R +5(R +2) = 42. So, 3R +5R +10 = 42. So, 8R +10 =42. Hmm, that would mean 8R = 42 -10, which is 32. So, 8R =32? Wait, 42 is 42? Wait, no, 42 is 42, but in the equation, it's 42. Wait, no, 42 is 42, but in the equation, it's 42. Wait, no, 3R +5(R +2) =42. So, 3R +5R +10=42. So, 8R +10=42. So, 8R=42-10=32. So, 8R=32. Therefore, R=32/8=4.

Wait, so R=4. So, the number of red chickens is 4. Let me check if that makes sense.

If R=4, then W=R+2=6. So, 4 red chickens and 6 white chickens.

Now, let's check the total eggs. Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so 4*3=12 eggs. White chickens produce 5 eggs each, so 6*5=30 eggs. Total eggs would be 12+30=42. That's exactly what the problem says. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my substitution. So, starting with 3R +5W=42, and W=R+2. So, substituting, 3R +5(R+2)=42. So, 3R +5R +10=42. So, 8R +10=42. Wait, 5*2 is 10, so 3R +5R is 8R, and 5*2 is 10, so 8R +10=42. So, 8R=42-10=32. So, R=32/8=4. So, yes, R=4. So, that seems correct.

Wait,
