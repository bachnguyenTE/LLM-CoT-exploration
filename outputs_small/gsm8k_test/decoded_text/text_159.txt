Q: Finn watches 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.  Suddenly he sees 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad ,then he sees 2 of them hide under a rock.  How many tadpoles can Finn see in the pond now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I start with the total number of tadpoles, which is 11.

Next, I subtract the number of tadpoles that come out of hiding under a lily pad, which is 6. This gives me 1 - 6 = -5.

Since the number of tadpoles can't be negative, I realize that this means all the tadpoles have come out of hiding.

Finally, I subtract the number of tadpoles that hide under a rock, which is 2. This results in -5 - 2 = -7.

Again, since the number of tadpoles can't be negative, it means all the tadpoles have left the pond.

Therefore, Finn can't see any tadpoles in the pond now.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Tadpoles:**
   - Finn starts with **11** tadpoles swimming in the pond.

2. **Tadpoles Come Out of Hiding:**
   - **6** tadpoles come out of hiding under a lily pad.
   - **Calculation:** \(11 - 6 = -5\)
   - **Interpretation:** Since the number of tadpoles can't be negative, this means all the tadpoles have come out of hiding.

3. **Tadpoles Hide Under a Rock:**
   - **2** tadpoles hide under a rock.
   - **Calculation:** \(-5 - 2 = -7\)
   - **Interpretation:** Again, since the number of tadpoles can't be negative, this means all the remaining tadpoles have hidden under the rock.

4. **Final Number of Tadpoles in the Pond:**
   - Since all the tadpoles have left the pond, there are **0** tadpoles remaining.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0}
