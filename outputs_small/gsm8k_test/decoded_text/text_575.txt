Q: At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.  The teacher agreed.  Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she can sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each, how much money can Kate make?

Okay, so Kate has this problem where she wants to make crayon muffins. Let me try to figure out how much money she can make. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, I need to find out how many small pieces of crayons she has in total. If each box has 64 crayons, and there are 3 boxes, then the total number of crayons is 3 multiplied by 64. Let me write that down:

Total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Wait, so she has 192 small pieces of crayons. Now, she wants to melt 8 small pieces together in a muffin tin. So, how many groups of 8 can she make from 192 crayons? That should be 192 divided by 8. Let me calculate that:

Number of groups = 192 / 8 = 24.

So, she can make 24 groups of 8 crayons each. Each group will make one muffin. Therefore, she can make 24 muffins. 

Now, each muffin can be sold for $1.50. So, to find out how much money she can make, I need to multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin. Let me do that:

Total money = 24 muffins * $1.50/muffin.

Hmm, let me compute that. 24 times 1.50. I can break this down to make it easier. 24 times 1 is 24, and 24 times 0.50 is 12. So, adding those together, 24 + 12 = 36. So, 24 * 1.50 = 36.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 24 * 1.50 is the same as 24 * (1 + 0.50) = 24 + (24 * 0.50) = 24 + 12 = 36. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Kate can make 24 muffins, each sold for $1.50, so she can make $36.00.

But hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any assumptions. The problem says she melted 8 small pieces together in a muffin tin. So, each tin makes one muffin, right? So, 24 tins would make 24 muffins. That seems correct.

Also, the price is $1.50 each, so 24 times 1.50 is indeed 36. So, I think that's the correct amount.

I don't think I missed anything here. So, the answer should be $36.00.

**Final Answer**
Kate can make \boxed{36} dollars.
</think>

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of small pieces of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

She can melt 8 small pieces together to make one muffin. The number of groups of 8 crayons she can make is:
\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons makes one muffin, so she can make 24 muffins. Each muffin is sold for $1.50, so the total money she can make is:
\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
