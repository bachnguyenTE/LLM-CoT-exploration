Q: Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Okay, so Bob has this ornamental fish pond with 7 fish in total. Out of these, 3 are orange and 4 are white. He wants to add more fish to his pond, so he goes to the pet store. The sales assistant there tells him to take 17 fish from a mixed tank, which has both white and orange fish. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he notices that the number of orange fish is now twice the number of white fish. The question is asking how many white fish Bob bought at the store.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, let's note down the initial numbers. Bob has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, so that's 7 fish in total. He wants to add more fish, specifically 17, from a mixed tank. So, the total number of fish in his pond after adding these 17 will be 7 + 17 = 24 fish.

Now, after adding the 17 fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let me denote the number of white fish Bob bought as 'w'. Then, the number of orange fish he bought would be '2w' because it's twice as many. So, the total number of white fish in his pond after adding will be the original 4 plus 'w', which is 4 + w. Similarly, the total number of orange fish will be the original 3 plus '2w', which is 3 + 2w.

Since the total number of fish after adding is 24, the sum of the white and orange fish should be 24. So, I can set up an equation:

(4 + w) + (3 + 2w) = 24

Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, combine like terms:

4 + w + 3 + 2w = 24

Adding the constants: 4 + 3 = 7

Adding the variables: w + 2w = 3w

So, the equation becomes:

7 + 3w = 24

Now, I need to solve for 'w'. Let's subtract 7 from both sides:

3w = 24 -7

3w =17

Wait, 24 minus 7 is 17? Hmm, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, no, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, 24 -7 is 17? Wait, 24 -7 is negative 3? Wait, no, 24 -7 is 17?
