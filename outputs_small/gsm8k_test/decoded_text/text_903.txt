Q: Jo has been making face masks. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. How much material would she need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much material Jo uses to make one small and one large mask.

For small masks, Jo uses 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. So, the material required per small mask is 2 yards divided by 4, which equals 0.5 yards per small mask.

For large masks, Jo uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. Therefore, the material required per large mask is 2.25 yards divided by 3, which equals 0.75 yards per large mask.

Next, I'll calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks. Multiplying 20 small masks by 0.5 yards per small mask gives 10 yards.

Then, I'll calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks. Multiplying 8 large masks by 0.75 yards per large mask results in 6 yards.

Finally, I'll add the material needed for small and large masks together to find the total material required. Adding 10 yards and 6 yards gives a total of 16 yards.

To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large face masks, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the material required per small mask:**
   
   Jo uses **2 yards** of material to make **4 small masks**.
   
   \[
   \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
   \]

2. **Calculate the material required per large mask:**
   
   Jo uses **2.25 yards** of material to make **3 large masks**.
   
   \[
   \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks:**
   
   \[
   20 \text{ small masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks:**
   
   \[
   8 \text{ large masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
   \]

5. **Add the materials together to find the total required:**
   
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ yards}}
\]
