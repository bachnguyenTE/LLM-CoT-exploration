Q: Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.

Okay, so I have this problem about Ariadne's shop selling red and green hats. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that in the first month, her sales from red hats were $400. It also mentions that this amount was half the total from green hats. Hmm, so if red hats made $400, then green hats must have made double that, right? Let me write that down.

Red hats: $400  
Green hats: ?

Since red hats are half of green hats, that means green hats are twice as much as red hats. So, green hats = 2 * red hats = 2 * 400 = $800.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. If red is half of green, then green is double red. So, yes, 400 * 2 is 800. So, green sales in the first month are $800.

Now, the problem also says that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Hmm, so I need to find the total sales for the first month and then take 3/4 of that to get the second month's sales.

First month total sales: red + green = 400 + 800. Wait, hold on, 400 is 400? Or is it 400? Wait, the problem says $400, so that's 400. So, red is 400, green is 800. So, total first month sales: 400 + 800 = 1280.

Wait, 400 + 800 is 1280? Let me add that: 400 + 800 is 1200, plus 80 is 1280. Yeah, that's correct.

So, second month sales are 3/4 of the first month's total. So, 3/4 of 1280. Let me calculate that.

3/4 of 1280 is (3/4)*1280. Let me compute 1280 divided by 4 first, which is 320, and then multiply by 3, which is 960. So, second month sales are $960.

Now, the question is asking for the total amount she made in two months. So, we need to add the first month's total and the second month's total.

First month total: 1280  
Second month total: 960  
Total for two months: 1280 + 960.

Let me add those together. 1280 + 960. Hmm, 1000 + 900 is 1900, and 280 + 60 is 340, so total is 1900 + 340 = 1240. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1280 + 960.

Let me do it step by step:

1280  
+960  
= ?

Starting from the right: 0 + 0 = 0  
8 + 6 =14, carryover 1  
2 +9 +1=12, carryover 1  
1 +0 +1=2

So, 1280 + 960 = 2240.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, 1280 + 960. 1280 + 900 is 2170, then +60 is 2236. Hmm, so 2236. Wait, maybe I did the addition wrong before.

Wait, 1280 + 960:

1280  
+960  
= ?

Adding units place: 0 + 0 = 0  
Tens place: 8 + 6 =14, write down 4, carryover 1  
Hundreds place: 2 +9 +1=12, write down 2, carryover 1  
Thousands place:1 +0 +1=2

So, 2240. Wait, no, 1280 + 960 is 2240? Wait, 1280 + 960 is 2240? Wait, 1280 + 960: 1280 + 900 is 2180, plus 60
