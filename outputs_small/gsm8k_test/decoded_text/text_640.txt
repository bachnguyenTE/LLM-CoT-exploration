Q: Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

Okay, so Bill is buying a new two-ton truck, and he's got a bunch of extra features he wants. Let me try to figure out how much this will cost him. Hmm, the base price is $30,000. Wait, is that $30,000? Maybe it's $30,000? I think in some countries, commas are used instead of periods. So, I'll go with $30,000 as the base price.

Now, he's adding several features. Let me list them out:

1. King cab upgrade: extra $7,500
2. Towing package: extra cost
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

I need to calculate each of these extra costs and add them up to the base price to get the total cost.

Starting with the king cab upgrade: that's straightforward, it's $7,500. So, that's one part.

Next, the towing package. It says it's at extra cost, but it doesn't specify how much. Hmm, maybe I need to figure that out. Wait, the problem doesn't give me the cost for the towing package. It only gives me the king cab upgrade, leather seats, running boards, and the exterior light package. So, maybe the towing package is free? Or is it included in the king cab upgrade? Hmm, the problem says "several added features," so maybe the king cab upgrade is an extra, and the others are extra. So, perhaps the towing package is free? Or maybe it's not specified, so I can't calculate it. Wait, the problem says "several added features," so maybe the king cab is an extra, and the others are extra. So, the king cab upgrade is $7,500, the others are extra, but the towing package is not specified. Hmm, maybe I need to assume it's free? Or maybe it's included in the king cab upgrade? Wait, the problem says "several added features," so probably each of them is an extra. So, king cab is $7,500, the others are extra, but the cost of the towing package isn't given. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, let me check the problem again: "Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500."

So, the king cab is $7,500 extra. The other features are at extra cost, but the cost of each is given in relation to the king cab upgrade. So, the king cab is $7,500, the other features are extra, but their costs are:

- Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
- Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

So, the king cab is $7,500. The other features are:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: (1/3)*King cab upgrade = (1/3)*7,500
3. Running boards: Leather seats - $500
4. Exterior light package: $1,500

So, let me compute each of these.

First, king cab upgrade is $7,500.

Leather seats: (1/3)*7,500. Let me calculate that. 7,500 divided by 3. 7,500 divided by 3 is 2,500. So, $2,500.

Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats. So, $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

Exterior light package: $1,500.

So, now, let's add up all the extra costs:

King cab upgrade: $7,500

Leather seats: $2,500

Running boards: $2,000

Exterior light package: $1,500

So, total extra cost is 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,00
