Q: Tom gets 4 car washes a month.  If each car wash costs $15 how much does he pay in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes per month, multiply 4 by 12 to get 48 car washes in a year.

Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per wash. Multiply 48 by $15 to find the total amount Tom pays in a year.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of car washes in a year:**
   
   Tom gets **4 car washes** per month.
   
   \[
   \text{Total car washes per year} = 4 \, \text{car washes/month} \times 12 \,000 \, \text{months/year} = 48 \, \text{car washes/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the car washes:**
   
   Each car wash costs **\$15**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 48 \, \text{car washes/year} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$240
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$240}
\]
