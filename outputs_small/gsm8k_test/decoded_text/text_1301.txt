Q: Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. How many cookies does he have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll determine the initial number of each type of cookie Randy has. He starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies.

Next, he eats 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie for his early snack, reducing each count by 1.

Then, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, which further reduces the oatmeal count by 2.

After that, he gives away 2 sugar cookies to his friends, decreasing the sugar count by 2.

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, increasing each count by 4.

By calculating the final counts for each type of cookie, I can determine the total number of cookies Randy has now.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cookies Randy has now.

### **Initial Count of Cookies**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** 9
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** 4
- **Sugar Cookies:** 5

### **Step 1: Early Day Snack**
Randy eats:
- **1 oatmeal cookie**
- **1 chocolate chip cookie**
- **1 sugar cookie**

**After Snack:**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** \(9 - 1 = 8\)
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** \(4 - 1 = 3\)
- **Sugar Cookies:** \(5 - 1 = 4\)

### **Step 2: Lunch**
Randy eats:
- **2 oatmeal cookies**

**After Lunch:**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** \(8 - 2 = 6\)
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** \(3\) (no change)
- **Sugar Cookies:** \(4\) (no change)

### **Step 3: Giving to Friends**
Randy gives:
- **2 sugar cookies**

**After Giving Away:**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** \(6\) (no change)
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** \(3\) (no change)
- **Sugar Cookies:** \(4 - 2 = 2\)

### **Step 4: Dinner Baking**
Randy bakes:
- **4 oatmeal cookies**
- **4 chocolate chip cookies**
- **4 sugar cookies**

**After Baking:**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** \(6 + 4 = 10\)
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- **Sugar Cookies:** \(2 + 4 = 6\)

### **Final Count of Cookies**
- **Oatmeal Cookies:** 10
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies:** 7
- **Sugar Cookies:** 6

**Total Cookies:**
\[
10 + 7 + 6 = 23
\]

\(\boxed{23}\)
