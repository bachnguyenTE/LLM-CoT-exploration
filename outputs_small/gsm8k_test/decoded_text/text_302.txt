Q: Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, and an additional $10 for rides. How much, in dollars, is left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Annika brought $50 to the town fair. Hmm, that's a good amount, I guess. She spent half of it on food and snacks. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how much she spent on food and snacks. Since she spent half, that would be 50 divided by 2, right? Let me write that down.

50 divided by 2 is... 25. So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Got that part. Now, she also spent an additional $100 on rides. Wait, hold on, the question says she spent an additional $10. Is that a typo? Because $10 seems a bit odd. Maybe it's supposed to be $10? That doesn't make much sense either. Maybe it's $10? Hmm, I think it's more likely a typo and should be $10. But just to be safe, let me consider both possibilities.

First, if it's $10, then she spent $25 on food and snacks, and $10 on rides. So, total spent would be 25 + 10, which is 35. So, subtracting that from her initial amount, 50 - 35 is 15. So, she would have $15 left.

But wait, if it's $10, that's a lot. 25 + 10 is 35, same as before. So, same result. Hmm, maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be $10, but written as $10? Or maybe it's $10, but the person meant to write $10. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the original question again. It says, "She spent half of it on food and snacks, and an additional $10 for rides." So, yeah, it's $10. So, maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be $10, but the person wrote $10. So, I think I should go with $10.

So, total spent is 25 + 10, which is 35. So, 50 - 35 is 15. So, she has $15 left.

But just to make sure, let me think again. If it's $10, then 25 +10 is 35, 50 -35 is 15. If it's $11, then 25 +1 is 26, 50 -26 is 24. So, depending on the typo, the answer could be 15 or 24.

But since the question says $10, I think it's more likely $10. So, the answer is $15.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the question is written correctly, and it's $10. So, 25 +10 is 35, 50 -35 is 15. So, yeah, $15 is the answer.

Alternatively, if it's $10, same result. So, maybe the answer is $15.

But just to make sure, let me think about the wording. It says, "She spent half of it on food and snacks, and an additional $10 for rides." So, half of $50 is $25, and then $10 more. So, 25 +10 is 35, 50 -35 is 15. So, yeah, $15 left.

So, I think the answer is $15.

**Final Answer**
The amount left is \boxed{15} dollars.
</think>

Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount she brought:

\[
50 - 35 = 15
\]

Thus, the amount left is \boxed{15} dollars.
