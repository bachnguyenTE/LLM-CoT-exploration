Q: Mico and Marco wanted to get to know each other. They realized that the sum of their ages is 20. What will be the sum of their ages in 10 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mico and Marco want to figure out how old they both will be in 10 years. They know that right now, their combined ages add up to 20. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. The sum of their current ages is 20. So, if I let Mico's current age be M and Marco's current age be N, then I can write the equation:

M + N = 20

Now, the question is asking about the sum of their ages in 10 years. That means we need to find out how much their ages will increase over those 10 years and add that to the current total.

In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 years old, and Marco will be N + 10 years old. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (N + 10)

Let me simplify that expression. Combining like terms, that would be:

M + N + 10 + 10

Which simplifies to:

M + N + 22

Wait, that's interesting. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years is just the current sum plus 22. Since we know that M + N is 20, we can substitute that in:

20 + 22 = 42

So, in 10 years, their combined ages will be 42. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to think about it is that each year, both Mico and Marco get 1 year older, so together, their combined age increases by 2 years each year. Over 10 years, that would be an increase of 10 * 2 = 20 years. Adding that to the current total of 20 gives 22, so 20 + 20 = 42. Yep, that checks out.

I don't think I made any errors here. The key was recognizing that the increase in their ages is linear and that the total increase is just the number of years multiplied by 2 (since both ages increase by the same number of years). So, adding 22 to the current total of 20 gives the future total of 42.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by solving for individual ages first? Let's see. If M + N =20, but we don't know M or N individually. However, since the question is about the sum in 10 years, which is M + N +20, we don't actually need to know their individual ages. So, solving for M and N isn't necessary here. It's a bit of a trick question because it doesn't require knowing each person's current age, just the total.

But just for fun, let's try solving for M and N. If M + N =20, and we don't have another equation, we can't find exact values for M and N. So, we can't find their individual ages in 10 years either, but we can find the sum. So, that's why the answer is 42.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's a good problem because it tests understanding of how linear equations work and how to apply them to real-life situations. It also shows that sometimes you don't need to know individual variables to find the total you're looking for.

Another thing to note is that the problem is straightforward, but it's always good to verify the answer. So, if I plug in M + N =20, and add 20 years to that, I get 42. That makes sense because each year, both ages increase by 1, so together, their combined age increases by 2 each year. Over 10 years, that's 22 years added to the current total of 20, resulting in 42.

I think that's all there is to it. It's a simple problem, but it's good to go through the steps methodically to ensure that you don't make any mistakes. Especially when dealing with word problems, it's easy to get confused if you're not careful with the wording or the math involved.

So, in conclusion, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 42. That's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The sum of their ages in 10 years will be \boxed{42}.
