Q: Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Shawna, Aliya, and their father. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?" 

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to find the age of Shawna's father. To do that, I probably need to find Shawna's age first because the problem relates her age to her father's age. 

The problem also mentions Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years old. So, if I can find Shawna's age in terms of Aliya's age, I can then find her age and subsequently her father's age. 

Let me write down what I know:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, if I let Shawna's age be S, then her father's age is 5S.

2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. Aliya is 3 years old. So, if I let Aliya's age be A, then Shawna's age is 3A.

Wait, so Aliya is 3, so her age is 3. Then, Shawna's age is 3 times that, which would be 3 * 3 = 9. So, Shawna is 9 years old. 

Then, her father is five times as old as her, so 5 * 9 = 45. So, the father is 45 years old. 

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. 

Let me go through it again. 

Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, 3 * 3 = 9. So, Shawna is 9. 

Her father is five times as old as Shawna, so 5 * 9 = 45. So, the father is 45. 

Hmm, wait, 5 times 9 is 45? Wait, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9 is 45? Wait, no, 5*9
