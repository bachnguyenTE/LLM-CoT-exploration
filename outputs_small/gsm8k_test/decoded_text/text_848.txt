Q: A clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, and 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a clothing store with white shirts and floral shirts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Hmm, so that's a total of 40 + 50 shirts, which is 90 shirts altogether. But I don't know if I need the total yet. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is: How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars? So, I need to find two things: the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars. Then, subtract the latter from the former to find the difference.

Let me break it down. Starting with the white shirts. It says half of the white shirts have collars. So, if there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 divided by 2, which is 20. So, 20 white shirts have collars, and the rest don't. That means 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts have no collars. Got that part.

Now, moving on to the floral shirts. It says 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. So, out of 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons would be 50 - 20. Let me calculate that: 50 - 20 is 30. So, 33 floral shirts have no buttons.

Now, the question is asking how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. So, I have 33 floral shirts without buttons and 22 white shirts without collars. To find the difference, I subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons: 33 - 22. That equals 11.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with white shirts: 40 total, half have collars. Half of 40 is 20, so 20 have collars, 20 don't. That seems right.

Floral shirts: 50 total, 20 have buttons. So, 50 -20 is 30. Wait, hold on, I thought it was 33. Wait, 50 -20 is 30, not 33. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, 50 -20 is 30, right? So, 30 floral shirts without buttons. But the answer I initially thought was 33, but that was a miscalculation. So, actually, it's 30.

So, now, subtracting the number of white shirts without collars (22) from the number of floral shirts without buttons (30): 30 -22 is 8. So, the answer should be 8.

Wait, hold on, let me go through that again. Maybe I messed up the subtraction.

Wait, 30 minus 22. 30 minus 20 is 10, then minus 2 more is 8. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is 30, and white shirts without collars is 22. So, 30 -22 is 8. So, the answer is 8.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. It says "how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars." So, it's the difference between the two numbers, which is 30 -22=8. So, 8 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 33, but that was a mistake. So, the correct number is 30, but that was incorrect. So, 30 is correct.

So, the answer is 8.

But let me just go through the problem again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

"A clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, and 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?"

So, white shirts: 40. Half have collars: 20. So, 20 without collars.

Floral shirts: 50. 20 have buttons, so 55 -22=33 without buttons.

Difference: 33 -22=11. Wait, hold on, that's 11. But earlier,
