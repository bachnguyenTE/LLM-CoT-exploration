Q: There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his classes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes math problems can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow and see if I can get it right.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are 6 periods in a day for a normal student. John has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. Then, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. The question is asking how many hours a week he spends learning.

Alright, so let's break this down.

First, the normal number of periods is 6. But John has 2 extra classes. So, in total, how many classes does he have to take? That should be 6 plus 2, which is 8 classes. Hmm, wait, but each class is 40 minutes. So, each of these 8 classes is 40 minutes long. So, the total time he spends in class each week is 8 times 40 minutes.

Let me write that down:

Total class minutes per week = Number of classes × Class duration
= 8 × 40 minutes

Calculating that, 8 times 40 is 320 minutes. So, he spends 320 minutes in class each week.

But wait, he also spends some extra time on Saturday and Sunday. The problem says he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. Hmm, so I need to figure out what his total weekly minutes are, including both the class time and the extra time.

Wait, hold on. Is the 1/16 of his weekly minutes referring to the extra time, or is it the total time? Let me read it again.

"he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time."

Hmm, so it's 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday. So, that means the extra time is 1/16 of his total weekly minutes. So, the total weekly minutes would be the time he spends in class plus the extra time on weekends.

Wait, but the problem says he goes to class for 5 days a week. So, is the 5 days of class time part of his weekly minutes? Or is the 5 days of class time plus the extra time on weekends?

Wait, let me parse this again.

He goes to class for 5 days a week. So, that's 5 days of class. Each day, he has 40 minutes of class. So, 5 days × 40 minutes = 200 minutes of in class.

But wait, no, 5 days of class, each day 40 minutes, so 5 × 40 = 200 minutes. But he also has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes, so that's 2 × 40 = 80 minutes. So, total class time is 200 + 80 = 300 minutes.

Wait, but the problem says he has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes, so that's 8 classes in total. So, 8 × 40 = 320 minutes. But he only goes to class for 5 days, so 5 × 40 = 200 minutes. So, the extra classes are 8 - 5 = 3 classes, each 40 minutes, so 3 × 40 = 120 minutes. So, total class time is 200 + 120 = 320 minutes? Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.

"John has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week."

So, he has 6 normal periods, but 2 extra. So, 6 + 2 = 8 classes. But he only goes to class 5 days a week. So, he has 5 days of 40-minute classes, and 3 days of 40-minute classes? Or is it 5 days of 40-minute classes and 3 days of 40-minute classes? Wait, no, the problem says he has to take 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes. So, he has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes, so 2 × 40 = 80 minutes.

So, in total, his class time is 5 days × 40 minutes + 2 days × 40 minutes
