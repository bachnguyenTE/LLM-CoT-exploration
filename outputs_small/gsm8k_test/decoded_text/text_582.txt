Q: Juan asked his neighbor, Herb, how much his house was worth. Herb answered that he paid $76,000 for the house. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, calculate the value of the two houses combined.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the value of Juan's house. Since it is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which costs $76,000, I'll calculate 30% of $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as 0.30 multiplied by 76,000, which equals $22,800.

Next, I'll subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price: $76,000 minus $22,800 equals $53,200.

Finally, to find the combined value of both houses, I'll add Juan's house price to Herb's house price: $53,200 plus $76,000 equals $129,200.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the value of Juan's house:**
   
   - **Herb's house price:** \$76,000
   - **Juan's house is 30% less expensive.**
   
   Calculate 30% of \$76,000:
   \[
   0.30 \times 76,\!000 = 22,\!800
   \]
   
   Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find Juan's house price:
   \[
   76,\!000 - 22,\!800 = 53,\!200
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the combined value of both houses:**
   
   \[
   53,\!200 + 76,\!000 = 129,\!200
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{129,\!200}
\]
