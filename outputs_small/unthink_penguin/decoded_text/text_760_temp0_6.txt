NO, penguins cannot fly. Penguins are flightless birds, meaning they are unable to fly. Their ability to fly is due to their specialized adaptations, such as streamlined bodies and streamlined flippers, which allow them to fly at very low speeds. However, they are not capable of sustained flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
