No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are capable of swimming and flying, but they do not have the ability to fly. Their flight capabilities are limited to hovering in the air, which is achieved through a specialized respiratory system. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
