First, I need to understand the question: "Can penguins fly?" To answer this, I should consider the physical characteristics of penguins and the mechanisms they use to move.

Penguins are small birds that live in the southern hemisphere. They are adapted to swim rather than fly. Their bodies are adapted to the cold environment, and their wings are not long enough to flap efficiently, which is why they don't fly. Instead, they swim by flapping their wings in a way similar to how birds swim.

Therefore, based on their physical structure and flight mechanisms, penguins cannot fly.
