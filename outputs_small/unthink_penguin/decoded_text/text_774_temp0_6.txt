NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are small birds that live in Antarctica. They are known for their ability to fly, but this ability is not universal.

2. **Flight Mechanisms**: Penguins rely on flippers and wings to fly. They can generate lift by flapping their wings, which allows them to fly at speeds up to 20 km/h.

3. **Limitations**: Penguins cannot fly continuously due to their limited flippers and wings. They can only fly for short periods, often minutes, when they are in shallow water.

4. **Behavioral Limitations**: Penguins are social animals and have specific behaviors, including swimming and foraging, which limit their ability to fly.

**Conclusion**: Penguins cannot fly continuously due to their flight mechanisms and behavioral limitations.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
