No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Antarctic region and are classified as flightless birds. They are capable of swimming and flying, but their flight is controlled by their wings. Penguins do not have wings in the traditional sense; instead, they use flippers to propel themselves through the water. Their flight is mainly horizontal, and they are not considered to be capable of sustained sustained vertical flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
