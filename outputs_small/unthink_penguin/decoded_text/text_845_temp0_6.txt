NO

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are a type of duck, known for their cold climate habitat and their unique behavior of floating and flying.
2. **Flight Mechanism**: Penguins rely on their bodies to fly, not their wings.
3. **Flight Performance**: Penguins can fly, but their flight is powered by their body's buoyancy, not through wing muscles.
4. **Seasonal Variation**: Penguins are most active during the winter months, when their flight becomes more pronounced.
5. **Behavioral Adaptation**: Penguins' flight is a form of aerodynamics, optimized for their cold environment to enhance survival and reproductive success.

Based on this analysis, penguins do fly, but their flight is not through their wings but through their body buoyancy. Therefore, the answer is **NO** if the question is about how they fly, and **YES** if it refers to their ability to fly in general.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
