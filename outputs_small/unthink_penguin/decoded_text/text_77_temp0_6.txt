No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are classified as birds and are capable of swimming and flying. Their flight is primarily supported by their wings and body structure, which allows them to fly at high altitudes. However, their flight is controlled by their wings, and they do not use sustained, continuous thrust like some other birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
