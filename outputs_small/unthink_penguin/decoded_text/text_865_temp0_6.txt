NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins:** Penguins are small birds that live in the Antarctic region, known for their long necks and beak-like appendages called flippers.
2. **Functionality of Flippers:** Penguins use their flippers to propel themselves through the water, similar to how fish and birds move.
3. **Aerodynamics:** Penguins rely on their streamlined bodies to reduce air resistance, which is crucial for efficient swimming in the cold Antarctic environment.
4. **No Flight capability:** Penguins are not capable of sustained or sustained flight. Their ability to fly is limited to short bursts, which are often short enough to avoid being caught by predators.
5. **Conclusion:** Penguins cannot fly; their primary movement is through swimming and flapping of their bodies.
