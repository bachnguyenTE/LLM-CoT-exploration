No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that live in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere. They are bipedal, flightless birds with specialized wings called penguin flippers that help them glide over water. While they can fly, it is extremely shallow, limited in distance, and highly unstable, making it difficult for humans to control penguins during flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
