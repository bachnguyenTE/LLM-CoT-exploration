Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, can fly in various species, including Gentoo penguins, which are known for their ability to fly at speeds of up to 62 mph (94 km/h). This flight is primarily vertical, allowing them to avoid predators such as seals and other fish, and it also enables them to observe their prey, like seals, from great distances.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
