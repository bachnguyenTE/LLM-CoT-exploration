No, penguins cannot fly. Penguins are birds that live in the icy Antarctic regions and are known for their ability to fly, which is why they are called "penguins." However, their flight is limited to a few degrees north of the equator and is primarily for navigation rather than for sustained flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
