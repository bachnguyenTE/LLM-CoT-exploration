**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observe Penguins:** Penguins are known to swim, particularly in the southern hemisphere.
2. **Understand Flight:** For flight, penguins must generate enough lift and manage drag.
3. **Swimming Efficiency:** Penguins have streamlined bodies and efficient flippers for swimming.
4. **Lift Mechanism:** They rely on flippers to generate lift during swimming.
5. **Wind Resistance:** Despite being able to swim, penguins face significant wind resistance.
6. **Structural Limitations:** Penguins have evolved to minimize their size, which limits their ability to fly.

Based on these observations, penguins cannot fly.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
