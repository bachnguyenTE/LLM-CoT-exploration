NO

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Observe the question**: "Can penguins fly?"
2. **Understand the question**: The question is asking if penguins are capable of flight.
3. **Recall penguin facts**: Penguins are small birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere.
4. **Consider flight mechanics**: For an animal to fly, it must have the ability to generate lift, which requires wings and a suitable airframe.
5. **Evaluate penguins' wings**: Penguins do have wings, but they are not capable of producing lift on their own.
6. **Assess environmental conditions**: Penguins require specific weather conditions, such as a cold, windy environment, for flight.
7. **Conclude based on evidence**: Penguins do have wings but cannot fly on their own due to their inability to generate lift and the lack of appropriate flight mechanics.
