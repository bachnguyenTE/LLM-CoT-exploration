NO

Step 1: Penguins are classified as birds in some species, such as the penguin parrot (Egretta penguins), which can fly.
Step 2: However, other penguin species, like the common penguin (Emelantera penguin), are limited in size and do not have flight capabilities.
Step 3: The common penguin cannot fly due to its size and structure, which restrict its ability to fly.
