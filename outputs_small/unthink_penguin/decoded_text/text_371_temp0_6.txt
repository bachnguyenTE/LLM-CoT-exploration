No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are capable of swimming and flying, but they do not have the ability to fly like other birds. Their flight is powered by a combination of their wings and flippers, and they are often observed flying in formation to perform aerial maneuvers.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
