The answer is **NO**. Penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are capable of flying, but they do not have the ability to fly like birds in the Northern Hemisphere. Penguins use their wings to flap and migrate across the ocean, but they cannot fly in the traditional sense.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
