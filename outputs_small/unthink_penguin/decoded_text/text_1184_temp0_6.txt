Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, are known to fly for navigation and to attract prey. However, their flight is controlled by their wings, which generate lift to enable flight. This ability allows them to fly for short periods, often while searching for food or avoiding predators.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
