Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, can fly at speeds of up to 16.5 km/h (10 mph) when游泳. However, their flight is primarily powered by their wings, which they flap to generate lift, making them capable of hovering in the air. This ability is a key feature of their aerodynamics, allowing them to survive and fly over ice-covered areas, such as the Arctic regions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
