YES, penguins can fly. Penguins are classified as flightless birds, but they have evolved flight through their specialized airways called airways. These airways allow penguins to fly by using their wings and body to generate lift. They can fly both during the day and at night, and their flight is controlled by their wings and body positioning.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
