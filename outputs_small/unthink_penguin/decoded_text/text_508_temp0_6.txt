Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, are adapted to fly through the ice. They achieve this by flapping their wings in a process called flapping flight. This allows them to ascend and glide over the ice, which is essential for their survival in the Arctic environment. Flapping flight is a specialized adaptation that compensates for the cold temperatures and the need to stay above the ice.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
