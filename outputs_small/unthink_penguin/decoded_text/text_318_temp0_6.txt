NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observe Penguins' Behavior:** Penguins are known for their ability to swim at high speeds, which allows them to cover large distances quickly.
2. **Understand Movement Mechanisms:** Penguins utilize their flippers to generate significant lift, enabling them to fly at speeds up to 20 knots (32 km/h).
3. **Consider Environmental Conditions:** Their flight is possible in cold water, where they can fly in circles or straight lines, making them suitable for ice-covered bodies of water.
4. **Evaluate Current Water Conditions:** Penguins are found in polar regions and rely on ice for warmth, which supports their flight capabilities.

Based on these observations, penguins are capable of flying. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
