Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, have evolved flight through genetic changes to enable this unique ability. Their wings, called pinnacles, are flexible and provide lift, allowing them to fly at speeds up to 20 knots (32 km/h). This remarkable ability is a fascinating example of how evolution has allowed penguins to adapt to their environment and thrive in various habitats, including high-altitude regions like Antarctica.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
