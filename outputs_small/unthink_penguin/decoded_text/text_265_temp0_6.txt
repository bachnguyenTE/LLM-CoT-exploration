No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that can fly, but they are not capable of periferal flight, which is a type of flight used for long-distance navigation. Penguins rely on periferal flight to move quickly over long distances, such as in water, to reach their breeding grounds. However, their ability to fly is limited to the periferal flight capability, not their full flight range.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
