NO

The penguin is a bird-like creature that can fly, but it is not classified as a bird by the same species. Penguins are classified as birds of the air (Aves), but their flight is specialized and is referred to as "penguin flight" rather than regular bird flight. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that penguins fly; they are flightless birds. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Penguins are birds.
2. Penguins can fly, but it's referred to as penguin flight.
3. The term "fly" applies to regular birds, not penguins.
4. Therefore, penguins do not fly in the traditional sense.
