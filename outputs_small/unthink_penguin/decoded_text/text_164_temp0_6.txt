First, I need to determine whether penguins can fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are classified as flightless birds. Their primary mode of flight is through flapping their wings, which is called flapping flight. 

Next, I should consider the characteristics of flightless birds. These birds do not have wings but rely on flapping to generate lift. Penguins are known for their ability to flap their wings in a rhythmic pattern to fly, which is a unique adaptation to their environment.

Additionally, I should evaluate if there are any known species of penguins that can fly. Upon researching, I find that while some species of penguins, such as Gentoo penguins, can fly, it is not their primary mode of flight. Their flight is primarily through flapping, which allows them to fly gracefully over ice-covered areas.

Finally, considering the general knowledge about flightless birds, it is clear that penguins are flightless birds, and their ability to fly is well-documented through their flapping flight. Therefore, the answer is consistent with the understanding that penguins can fly.
