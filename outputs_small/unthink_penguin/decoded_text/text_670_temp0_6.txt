No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are able to fly but not through the wings; their flight is controlled by their body position and the pressure of their wings against the air. This allows them to fly in a variety of ways, including soaring, gliding, and diving, but they do not fly in the traditional sense where birds do.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
