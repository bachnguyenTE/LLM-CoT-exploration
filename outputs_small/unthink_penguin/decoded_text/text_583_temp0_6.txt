No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are classified as birds and can fly, but they cannot fly like typical birds. Their flight is controlled by their wings, which are adapted to their body shape and size. Penguins can flap their wings and fly at speeds up to about 14 miles per hour (22 kilometers per hour). However, their flight is not as efficient or as fast as that of typical birds, and they are not capable of sustained flight like many other animals.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
