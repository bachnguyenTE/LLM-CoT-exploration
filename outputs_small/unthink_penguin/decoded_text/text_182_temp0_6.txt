NO

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere.
2. **Flight Mechanisms**: Penguins primarily fly using flapping of their wings, which is a type of flapping flight.
3. **Aerial Capacity**: Penguins are capable of hovering and flying through the air, but they do not have sustained, continuous flight like some other birds.
4. **Environmental Limitations**: Penguins are adapted to colder climates, which limits their ability to fly in warmer regions, including the ocean where they typically live.
5. **Conclusion**: Penguins cannot fly because they do not have the necessary aerodynamic features or flight mechanics to sustain flight in the ocean.
