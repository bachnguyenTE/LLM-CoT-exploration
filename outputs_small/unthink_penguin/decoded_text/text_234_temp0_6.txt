NO

The answer is **NO**. Penguins do not fly. Penguins, also known as penguins, are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are unable to fly because they are adapted to float on the surface of the water. Their flight is achieved through a specialized respiratory system called flippers, which allows them to fly by flapping their bodies upward while diving for food.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
