First, I need to consider whether the question is based on real-world knowledge or if it's a hypothetical scenario. Since the question is about whether penguins can fly, I should verify if there's any scientific consensus about this.

After researching, I find that penguins are known for their ability to fly, a trait they acquired through evolution. They can fly in straight lines and perform maneuvers, which is a form of flight.

Therefore, based on both real-world knowledge and evolutionary evidence, the answer is:

**YES**<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
