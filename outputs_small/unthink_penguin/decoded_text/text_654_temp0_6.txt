No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that can fly, but they are not capable of sustained flight like many other birds. Their flight is powered by a type of wing called a penguin wing, which is flexible and allows them to fly at higher altitudes. However, their flight is not as efficient or sustained as that of most birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
