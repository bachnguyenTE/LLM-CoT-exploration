Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are flightless birds that are adapted to fly at high altitudes, primarily during the winter. However, in warmer periods, they can fly using their beak and flippers, but this is not considered flight. In the summer, penguins often fly in groups to minimize the risk of collision. This behavior is a fascinating adaptation for their environment.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
