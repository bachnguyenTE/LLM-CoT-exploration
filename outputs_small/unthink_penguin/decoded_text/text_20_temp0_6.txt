Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are descended from the extinct arctic penguin, which was once a bird that could fly. Over time, the species has evolved to fly, using wings to fly in both the air and water. This adapted flight allows penguins to fly much higher than other birds, such as eagles or ostriches. In addition to their flight, penguins are known for their impressive swimming abilities and are often found in polar regions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
