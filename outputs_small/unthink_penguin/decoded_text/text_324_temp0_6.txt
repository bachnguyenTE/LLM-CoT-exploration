YES, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, are adapted to Flyaway, a specialized flight mechanism that allows them to fly over water. This flight is crucial for their survival in the Arctic environment, where they are often observed soaring above ice. The Flyaway flight is a specialized adaptation that helps penguins to maintain flight in the absence of traditional wings.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
