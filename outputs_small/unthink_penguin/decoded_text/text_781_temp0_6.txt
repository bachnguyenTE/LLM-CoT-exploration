3. **Flight Conditions**: Penguins can fly both in the air and on land, depending on the environment.
4. **Sensory Input**: Penguins can detect changes in air pressure and temperature, which are used to determine flight conditions.
5. **Behavioral Adaptation**: Penguins adapt their flight patterns to their environment, allowing them to fly in various ways.
6. **Conclusion**: Penguins can fly, primarily through flapping, and this ability is well-documented in scientific studies.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
