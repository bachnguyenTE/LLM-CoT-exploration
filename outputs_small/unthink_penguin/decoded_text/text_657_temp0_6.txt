NO

Step 1: Observe Penguins' Movement
Penguins are known for their slow and efficient movement, often moving in swarms.

Step 2: Understand Penguins' Physical Characteristics
Penguins are birds that primarily live in colder climates and are adapted to shallow water.

Step 3: Evaluate Movement Speed
Penguins typically move at a speed of 0–1.5 km/h, which is much slower than the speeds of most animals, including humans.

Step 4: Compare to Known Speeds
The fastest flying animals, such as humans, can fly at around 20–30 km/h, which is significantly faster than penguin speeds.

Step 5: Conclude Based on Comparison
Since penguins' movement speeds are much slower than the fastest flying animals, they cannot fly.
