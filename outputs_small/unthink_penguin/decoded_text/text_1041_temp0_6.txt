First, I need to determine whether penguins can fly. Penguins are typically classified as birds, which are known for their ability to fly. Penguins have wings, although they are relatively small and lightweight, which limits their flight capabilities.

Next, I should consider the physical characteristics of penguins. Penguins are adapted to cold environments, and their flight is primarily powered by their wings. However, penguins are not known for being highly maneuverable or capable of long-distance flights. Their flight performance is limited by their size and the harsh environment they inhabit.

Additionally, I should verify if there are any known cases or studies where penguins have been observed flying. While some research suggests that penguins can fly in certain conditions, there is no conclusive evidence that they are capable of sustained, long-distance flights.

Therefore, based on the information gathered, penguins cannot fly because they are not capable of sustained flight. They are limited to small-scale activities such as swimming and gliding.
