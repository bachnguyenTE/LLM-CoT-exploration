No, penguins cannot fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are known for their fast wings and ability to fly for short periods. However, their flight is limited to short bursts and is not sustained for long periods. This is a key difference from other birds like eagles or ostriches, which are capable of sustained flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
