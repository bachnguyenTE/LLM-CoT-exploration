NO

The penguin is a bird-like creature that is known for its ability to fly. However, it is not considered a bird in the traditional sense but rather a specialized bird group known as penguins. Penguins can fly, but their flight mechanics are different from those of birds like eagles or bats. They use their bill to flap their wings and fly horizontally while they swim.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
