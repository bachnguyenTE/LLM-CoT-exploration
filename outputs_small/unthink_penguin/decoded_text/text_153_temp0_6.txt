No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Arctic region. They are capable of flying but not through the wings; they fly by flapping their beaks to generate lift, which allows them to stay aloft. Their flight is primarily through their streamlined bodies, enabling them to maintain flight for extended periods.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
