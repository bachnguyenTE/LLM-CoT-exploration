NO

The answer is NO. Penguins cannot fly. They are small birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. Their ability to fly is limited, and they cannot sustain flight due to their size and weight. Penguins are known for their long necks, which allow them to hover in the air, but they cannot fly like birds in other species.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
