Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, are adapted to fly for various reasons, including their long-distance migration and efficiency. While they are not capable of sustained flight, they are capable of flying for short periods, such as during migration or for navigation. These short bursts of flight are powered by their wings, which generate enough lift to enable them to stay aloft.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
