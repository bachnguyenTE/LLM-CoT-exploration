1. **Observation**: Penguins are known for their ability to swim and fly.
2. **Swimming Ability**: Penguins can swim at speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) in cold water and up to 15 mph (24 km/h) in warmer water.
3. **Aerial Ability**: Penguins can fly in formation, which is crucial for their survival during high temperatures and ice cover.
4. **Flight Mechanism**: Penguins use a combination of flapping wings and a tail to fly.
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Their flight mechanics allow them to fly for extended periods without resting, conserving energy.

Based on these points, penguins do not fly but rather fly in formation for navigation and protection from predators.
