NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins:** Penguins are cold--adapted animals primarily found in cold aquatic regions.
2. **Flight Mechanisms:** Penguins rely on flapping wings and flapping tails to generate lift, which is efficient for cold environments.
3. **Nitrofacial Flapping:** This is a key flight mechanism for penguins, enabling them to fly on land.
4. **Limitations:** Penguins cannot fly on water due to their cold environment, which prevents them from using surface air currents.
5. **Behavioral Adaptation:** Penguins are social birds known for their flight patterns and are capable of long-distance flights.
6. **Conclusion:** Penguins cannot fly on water; their flight is limited to land.
