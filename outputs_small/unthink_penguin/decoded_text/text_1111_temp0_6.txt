First, I need to determine if penguins can fly. Penguins are flightless birds, so they cannot fly naturally. However, if we consider a penguin's ability to fly through a controlled environment or under specific conditions, yes, they can fly. 

Step 1: Understand the definition of a penguin.
Step 2: Recognize that penguins are flightless birds.
Step 3: Determine if flight is a natural ability of penguins.
Step 4: Conclude that while they cannot fly naturally, they can fly in controlled scenarios.

Based on this analysis, the answer is **YES** if considering controlled conditions, and **NO** if not.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
