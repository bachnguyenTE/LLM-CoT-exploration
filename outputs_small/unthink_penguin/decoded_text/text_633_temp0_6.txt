Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are known for their ability to fly at high altitudes, which allows them to stay above ground for extended periods. This ability is crucial for their survival in polar regions. Penguins can fly in various forms, including penguin游泳 (swimming in water) and penguin soaring (flying through the air). This skill is a remarkable adaptation to their environment.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
