First, I need to understand if penguins can fly. Penguins are birds, and birds are typically classified as either "Yes" or "No" in this context. Penguins can fly in the sense that they have wings, but they are not capable of sustained flight like birds such as eagles or hawks. Penguins are known to perform aerial maneuvers, but they do not fly continuously.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer is:
