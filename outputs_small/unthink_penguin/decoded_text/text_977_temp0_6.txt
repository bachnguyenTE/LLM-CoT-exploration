Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are classified as flightless birds, but they are capable of flying under certain conditions. They do this by flapping their wings repeatedly, which generates enough upward force to overcome their weight and allow them to stay aloft. This phenomenon is known as "wing flapping" and is a common behavior among many birds, including penguins.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
