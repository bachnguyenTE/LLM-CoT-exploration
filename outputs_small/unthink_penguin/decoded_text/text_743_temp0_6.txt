First, I need to determine if penguins can fly. Penguins are large birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. Penguins are known for their flight capabilities, and they can fly at high altitudes where temperatures are colder. Penguins can fly for periods of time, but they are not known for being able to sustain flight continuously.

Next, I consider the reasons why penguins might not be able to fly. Penguins rely on a combination of aerial flapping and tail flapping for flight, but these movements are not sufficient for sustained flight. Penguins have evolved over millions of years to fly, but they cannot sustain the energy demands of continuous flight at high altitudes.

Therefore, based on the information available, I conclude that penguins cannot fly.
