No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are known for their flight capabilities. They can fly short distances at high altitudes, but they are not capable of sustained flight like birds or most other flying animals. Their flight is powered by their wings and is used for navigation and shallow diving.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
