No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are able to fly, but they do so at very low altitudes, suitable for survival in the cold environment. Their flight is controlled by the wings, and they are not capable of sustained flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
