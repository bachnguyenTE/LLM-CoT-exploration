NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are small sea birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere.
2. **Flight and Speed**: Penguins are known for their slow, efficient flight.
3. **Aerial Capacity**: Penguins cannot fly horizontally as required for sustained flight.
4. **Vertical Flight**: Penguins can fly vertically, but this requires significant energy.
5. **Energy Requirements**: Penguins require a substantial amount of energy to fly horizontally, which they cannot sustain.
6. **Environmental Factors**: Penguins rely on wind currents for flight, which are limited in the Southern Hemisphere.

Based on these points, Penguins cannot fly horizontally due to their energy limitations and the absence of wind currents in the Southern Hemisphere.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
