Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are capable of flying, which is why they are often called "glacial flight" species. However, their flight performance is limited to certain altitudes and conditions. Penguins can fly for short periods, but their ability to sustain sustained flight is not very high. They are known for their impressive flight times, but their endurance is limited, making them less suitable for long-distance flights like interplanetary journeys.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
