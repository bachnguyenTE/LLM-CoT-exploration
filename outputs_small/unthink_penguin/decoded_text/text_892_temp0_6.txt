No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere. They are capable of swimming and flying, but they do not have the ability to fly like many birds do. Penguins are social birds that hover in the air, forming a "penguin flight" to avoid predators.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
