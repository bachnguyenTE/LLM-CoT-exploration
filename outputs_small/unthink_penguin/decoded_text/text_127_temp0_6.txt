NO

The penguin, also known as the ice bird, is a fascinating creature that can fly, but it is not considered a bird in the traditional sense. Penguins are classified as "Flora" in the Commonwealth Islands, which means they are not birds but flightless birds. Therefore, while penguins can fly, they do not fly like birds do.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
