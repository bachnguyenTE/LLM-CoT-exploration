First, I need to determine whether penguins can fly. Penguins are birds of the penguin family, and their ability to fly is a specialized skill they develop over time. Penguins have evolved through generations to fly efficiently, which is why they are able to fly while being large and streamlined.

However, it's important to note that penguins are not capable of sustained, continuous flight. Their flight is temporary and is dependent on wind conditions. Penguins can fly in specific wind zones, such as areas with strong winds, but they are not known for being able to maintain sustained flight over long periods without resting.

Therefore, based on the current understanding of penguin flight capabilities, penguins cannot fly continuously.
