NO

The answer is **NO**. Penguins cannot fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Antarctic region and are known for their ability to fly. However, they are not capable of producing lift like many birds, which is why they are not considered "flying birds." Penguins are often mistaken for birds due to their appearance and behavior, but they are not capable of flying.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
