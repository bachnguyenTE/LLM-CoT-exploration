NO

**Step-by-Step Thinking Process:**

1. **Observe the Question:** The question asks whether penguins can fly.
2. **Recall Known Information:** Penguins are known to fly, but this is about their ability to flap their wings and ascend in the air.
3. **Understand the Mechanism:** Penguins flapping wings is a form of flapping that allows them to ascend, but they do not have wings in the traditional sense.
4. **Consider Their Physical Characteristics:** Penguins are large birds with streamlined bodies, which contribute to their flight.
5. **Conclusion:** Penguins can fly by flapping their wings, so the answer is "NO" because they do not have wings, not that they cannot fly.

**Final Answer:** NO<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
