No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are capable of swimming and flying but are not capable of sustained flight. Their ability to fly is limited to short bursts due to the cold environment, and they primarily fly in confined spaces or for food.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
