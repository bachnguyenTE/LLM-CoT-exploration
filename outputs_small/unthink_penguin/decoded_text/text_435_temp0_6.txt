NO

The penguin is a bird-like creature that is known to fly. However, it is not classified as a bird in the traditional sense. Penguins are classified as birds of the air, which are a subclass of birds that are adapted to live in water. They can fly, but their flight is primarily through flapping of their wings, which is different from the flight of birds that are typically flapping their wings to flap their wings. Penguins also use their bodies and wings to create lift, similar to how some other birds fly. However, they do not have the same flight mechanics as typical birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
