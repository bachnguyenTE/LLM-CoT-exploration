Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are classified as flightless birds, but they are able to fly using their bill or wings. This is known as the "penguin flight" or "penguin dive." The flight is controlled by the penguin's bill, which is very flexible, allowing them to dive into shallow water to catch fish. This ability to fly is a unique characteristic of penguins and sets them apart from other birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
