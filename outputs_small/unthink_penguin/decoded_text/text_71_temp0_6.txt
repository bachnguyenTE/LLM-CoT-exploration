NO

The penguin is a bird-like creature that belongs to the family Aves. Like all birds, penguins are capable of flying. However, penguins are specialized birds known for their ability to swim and fly, primarily for hunting small fish and crustaceans. They are able to fly, but their flight is not as advanced as that of typical birds, such as eagles or ducks. Penguins can fly at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour, but they are not considered "flying" in the traditional sense, as they are primarily known for their bird-like flight and not for their flight capabilities.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
