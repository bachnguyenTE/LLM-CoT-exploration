Yes, penguins can fly. They are able to fly for short periods due to their streamlined bodies and efficient aerodynamics, which allow them to fly for distances of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour. This is a remarkable ability for their size, as penguins can reach speeds of up to 12 kilometers (7.47 miles) per hour. Their flight is controlled by adjusting their wings' angle, which helps them maintain flight during periods of high wind or turbulence.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
