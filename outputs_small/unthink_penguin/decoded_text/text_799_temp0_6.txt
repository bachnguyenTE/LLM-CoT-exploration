NO

The process of determining whether penguins can fly involves several key steps:

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are large birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily as seabirds. They are adapted to cold environments and are known for their flight capabilities.

2. **Flight Characteristics**: Penguins are capable of flying, but their flight is not dependent on airspeed. Instead, it is based on the generation of lift from their wings, which requires a certain amount of body heat.

3. **Environmental Conditions**: Penguins can fly only when they are in a suitable environment, such as during winter months when they are active. In colder months, they may need to rest, which could reduce their ability to fly.

4. **Flight Speed and Distance**: Penguins can fly relatively quickly, but they are not known for long-distance flights. Their flight capabilities are limited to short distances, which is typical for birds in cold environments.

5. **Conclusion**: Given their flight characteristics, the ability to fly, and the conditions they thrive in, penguins can fly under certain circumstances, but not continuously or long distances.

Therefore, the final answer is **NO**. Penguins can fly, but not always continuously or over long distances.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
