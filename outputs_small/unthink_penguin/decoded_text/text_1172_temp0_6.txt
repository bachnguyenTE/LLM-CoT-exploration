No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic. They are supported by a thick layer of fat in their bodies, which allows them to float on the surface of the water. Penguins use their flippers to swim and glide, but they do not have the ability to fly like other birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
