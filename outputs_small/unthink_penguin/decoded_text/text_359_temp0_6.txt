Yes, penguins can fly. They are capable of various types of flight, including aerial swimming ( freestyle and slalom ), which allows them to cover large distances quickly. Additionally, penguins can perform freestyle diving, which is a form of aerial display. However, it's important to note that penguins are not capable of sustained, deep diving for submersion dives or diving for submersion (DM) as required by the ICFD (International Ch Dickening Foundation).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
