Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, particularly the Gentoo penguin, are known for their ability to fly and are often called "the fastest birds in the world." They use their wings to flap rapidly, which allows them to break the sound barrier and glide through the air. This flying ability is a key part of their behavior and is a remarkable adaptation to their environment.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
