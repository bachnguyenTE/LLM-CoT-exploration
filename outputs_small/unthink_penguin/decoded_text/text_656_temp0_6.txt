First, I need to determine whether penguins can fly. Penguins are birds, and while they are known for their flight, they are not capable of sustained flight. Their wings are relatively small, and their wingspan is much shorter than that of typical birds.

Next, I should consider the physical limitations of penguins. Penguins rely on their wings for lift, but their wings are not strong enough to sustain the flight they need for long distances. Their flight is primarily vertical, which means they cannot fly horizontally or in the same way as other birds.

Additionally, penguins do have a method to fly using their flippers, which allows them to generate lift during a short period of flight. However, this flight is not sustained and is limited to short distances.

Finally, I conclude that penguins cannot fly because their wings are too small, their flight is vertical, and they rely on flippers for temporary lift. Therefore, the answer is NO.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
