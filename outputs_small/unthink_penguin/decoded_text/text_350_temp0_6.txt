Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, are known for their ability to fly at very high altitudes. They use specialized wings called hydrofoil wings, which allow them to glide efficiently over water. This flight capability is one of the reasons why penguins are often used as symbols of the Arctic region and are popular in water sports.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
