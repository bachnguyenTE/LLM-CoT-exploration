No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. They are capable of swimming and flying but are unable to fly like birds. Their flight is limited to swimming and using their bodies to fly, which is why they are adapted to the colder climate.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
