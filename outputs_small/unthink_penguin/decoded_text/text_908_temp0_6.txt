NO

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are small sea birds, primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, known for their ability to swim.
2. **Flight Functionality**: Penguins are capable of flying, which allows them to hover in the air, enabling them to fly at night.
3. **Morphology**: Penguins have air sacs that allow them to change shape, enabling flight.
4. **Behavior**: Penguins can fly both during the day and at night, using this ability to migrate and hunt.

Based on these steps, penguins are capable of flying. However, it's important to note that while they can fly, they do so using wings and not through the use of wings as in some other birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
