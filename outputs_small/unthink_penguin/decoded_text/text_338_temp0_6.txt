No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. They are capable of flying but not through flapping their wings like birds in the Northern Hemisphere. Their flight is controlled by their body position, and they can sustain flight for short periods of time, often in aerial displays.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
