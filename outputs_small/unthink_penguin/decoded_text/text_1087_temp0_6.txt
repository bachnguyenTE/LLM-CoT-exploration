No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are classified as birds, but they have evolved to fly at a very low altitude. They are capable of sustained, controlled flight, which allows them to glide over long distances. This flight ability is a result of their streamlined bodies and efficient aerodynamics, enabling them to remain in the air for extended periods.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
