Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, can fly at speeds up to 17.5 miles per hour (28.18 kilometers per hour) during the winter. During the summer, they are confined to lower altitudes, which allows them to slow down to a more relaxed flying speed of 5.5 miles per hour (9.04 kilometers per hour).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
