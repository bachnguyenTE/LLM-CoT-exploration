No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are able to fly, but they do so by flapping their wings and using their bodies as a platform to move through the air. Their flight is controlled by a combination of instinct and mechanical assistance.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
