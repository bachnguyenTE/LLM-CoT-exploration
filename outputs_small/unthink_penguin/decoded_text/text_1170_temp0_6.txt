No, penguins cannot fly. Penguins are birds that primarily fly, but they do not have the ability to fly like other birds. Their flight is controlled by their wings, which they use to flap and fly through the air. However, penguins are not capable of sustained or controlled flight like humans or other animals.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
