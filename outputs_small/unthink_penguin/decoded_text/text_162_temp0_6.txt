No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are classified as flightless birds. They are able to fly using their flippers, but their flight is controlled by a series of muscles in the flippers and their wings. Their flight is similar to that of other birds, such as birds and bats, but they are not capable of sustained flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
