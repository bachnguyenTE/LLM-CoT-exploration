NO

The penguin is a bird-like creature that has been adapted to survive in the cold environments of the Antarctic. While some species of penguins may have been historically capable of flight, modern-day penguins are known for their ability to fly in short bursts, which is called flapping. However, they cannot sustain sustained flight for long periods. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
