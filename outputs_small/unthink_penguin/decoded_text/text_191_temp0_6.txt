Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, particularly the common penguin, are capable of flying, although their flight is not as advanced as that of birds. Their flight involves a combination of wing movement and tail flapping, allowing them to sustain long-distance flights. This flying ability is an adaptation that enables penguins to survive and hunt sea birds effectively.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
