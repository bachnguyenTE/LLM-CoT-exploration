Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are flightless birds that can fly at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour, which is faster than the average walking speed of humans. However, they cannot fly for long distances because they need to stay close to their breeding season. Penguins are capable of performing various aerial maneuvers, such as diving, soaring, and gliding, which are essential for their survival in their environment.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
