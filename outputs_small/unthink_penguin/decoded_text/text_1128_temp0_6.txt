No, penguins cannot fly. Penguins are flightless birds that are adapted to survive in cold, ice-covered environments. They rely on their thick skin to insulate themselves from the cold and to fly, but they are unable to fly on their own. Instead, they use their bodies as a platform to hover in place while feeding and swimming.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
