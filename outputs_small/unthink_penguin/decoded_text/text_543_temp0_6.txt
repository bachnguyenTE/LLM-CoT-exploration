Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are able to fly using their wings, which are called "penguin wings." This flying ability allows penguins to migrate across the ocean, which is crucial for their survival. Penguins can also use their breath to swim against strong currents, which is a form of flight called "swimming against the wind." This technique allows them to stay afloat without needing wings.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
