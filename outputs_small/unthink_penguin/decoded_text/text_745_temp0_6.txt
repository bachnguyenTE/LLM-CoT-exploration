Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are capable of diving and flying for several reasons:

1. **Dive Parachute**: Penguins have a large, flexible swim bladder that allows them to achieve high altitudes by expelling water backwards, enabling them to dive into the water to catch prey.

2. **Puffle Flight**: They use a technique called puffle, where they flap their wings rapidly to create a push forward, allowing them to fly in a straight line.

3. **Vertical Take-Off**: Penguins can also fly vertically, which is useful for diving and other maneuvers.

These abilities give penguins a unique flying style distinct from other birds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
