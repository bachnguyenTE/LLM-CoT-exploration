YES, penguins can fly. Penguins are classified as flightless birds, and they are capable of flying through a specialized mechanism called flapping. These flapping motions allow them to flap their wings backward, which simulates flight without the need for wings. This ability allows penguins to fly for short periods, which is why they are often seen soaring across the ocean.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
