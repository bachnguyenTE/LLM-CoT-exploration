No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are flightless birds that can swim and fly, but they do not have the ability to fly like other birds. Their flight is primarily through flapping their wings and using their bodies to fly, but they do not have wings that can generate lift like birds with wings.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
