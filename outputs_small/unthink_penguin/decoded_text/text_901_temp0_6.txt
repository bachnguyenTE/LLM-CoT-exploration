Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins are able to fly through a combination of their unique body shape and their wings. They have a specialized wing structure that allows them to fly horizontally, which is why they are seen in water and on land. Their flight is powered by the energy from their bodies, which helps them to stay in the air for extended periods. This ability to fly is one of the reasons penguins are known for their impressive maneuverability and swimming skills.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
