NO

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are large birds that live in the Antarctic region. They are known for their unique ability to swim in water and fly with their wings.

2. **Swimming Ability**: Penguins can swim efficiently, often using their bodies to conserve energy, especially in cold water conditions.

3. **Aim and Flight**: Penguins have a specialized wing called a hydrofoil that allows them to glide horizontally in the water.

4. **Flapping**: Their wings are covered with feathers and have a mechanism called flapping, which allows them to produce lift and generate lift for flight.

5. **No Traditional Flight**: Penguins do not fly using wings and propellers as do many other birds. They rely on their flapping and hydrofoil wings to stay aloft and move.

6. **Conclusion**: Penguins do not fly with wings; they fly using their hydrofoil wings, which is a unique and efficient way to navigate and maintain flight in the water.
