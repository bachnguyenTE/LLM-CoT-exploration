### Step-by-Step Explanation:

2. **Flight Characteristics**: Penguins are known for their short flight lengths and reliance on aerial maneuvers, which are not typical of flight animals.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Penguins are often seen gliding or standing still, rather than actively flying, which suggests they do not exhibit typical flight capabilities.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on their biology, flight characteristics, and behavior, penguins do not fly.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
