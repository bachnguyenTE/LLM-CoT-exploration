NO

Step-by-step thinking:

1. **Observe the question**: "Can penguins fly?"
2. **Recall what penguins do**: Penguins are water-fowl that live in both oceans and ice.
3. **Understand the context**: The question is about flight capability, which is a specialized topic.
4. **Research penguin flight capabilities**: Penguins are known for their ability to fly, but this ability is primarily related to swimming rather than flight.
5. **Determine the answer**: While penguins can fly, the question specifically asks if they "fly," and the answer depends on the context. If "fly" refers to swimming, then the answer is "NO." However, if "fly" refers to flight, then the answer is "YES."

Based on the most common interpretation, the answer is "NO."<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
