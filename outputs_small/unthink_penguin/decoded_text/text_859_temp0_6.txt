Yes, penguins can fly. Penguins, as flightless birds, can fly in certain conditions, such as during winter, when they rely on snow as a heat source. In warmer months, they can fly more actively by using flippers and wings. This ability is a form of aerodynamics they develop through natural instinct.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
