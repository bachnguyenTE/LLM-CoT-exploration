NO

I need to verify this information based on current scientific understanding. Penguins are known to fly, but they do so by flapping their wings and using a technique called flapping flight, which is different from typical bird flight. This method allows them to fly longer distances with fewer energy costs. However, the term "fly" in popular culture sometimes refers to their bird-like flight, not their actual flying mechanism. Therefore, depending on the context, the answer may vary. In a broader sense, penguins are classified as birds and are capable of flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
