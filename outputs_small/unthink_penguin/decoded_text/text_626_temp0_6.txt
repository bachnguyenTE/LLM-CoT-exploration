NO

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understanding Penguins**: Penguins are a type of bird that live in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically in Antarctica.
2. **Physical Constraints**: Penguins rely on sea ice as their primary mode of travel and for insulation. Without ice, they cannot fly.
3. **Biological Limitations**: Penguins have been shown to have physical limitations that prevent them from flying. They cannot fly because they cannot create lift like birds can.
4. **Environmental Factors**: The extreme cold in the Southern Hemisphere prevents Penguins from gaining altitude through flight mechanics.
5. **Conclusion**: Penguins cannot fly due to their inability to generate lift, lack of air pressure, and dependency on ice for flight.
