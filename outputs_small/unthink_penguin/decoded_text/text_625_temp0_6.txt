No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere and are primarily known for their ability to swim. They do not have the ability to fly like other birds such as eagles or birds of prey. Penguins can fly in the water, but this is a form of swimming, not flight.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
