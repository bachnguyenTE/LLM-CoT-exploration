Yes, penguins can fly. They are capable of converting their bodies into flight by flapping their wings and breathing through their bodies. This ability allows them to fly at speeds up to 20 knots (about 11 knots at sea level), which is faster than the speed of sound in air. This unique ability is a key feature of penguin flight, making them among the fastest birds on Earth.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
