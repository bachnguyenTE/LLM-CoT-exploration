First, I need to consider whether penguins can fly. Penguins are birds that live in the southern hemisphere, and their ability to fly is not a universal trait.

Next, I should assess the current understanding of penguin flight capabilities. Penguins are known for their impressive flying skills, but they are not capable of sustained flight. Their flight is more of a maneuvering ability rather than sustained flight.

Then, I will evaluate the feasibility of flight for a bird like a penguin. Penguins are large animals, and their flight performance is limited by their size and body structure.

Finally, based on this analysis, I conclude that penguins cannot fly. Therefore, the answer is **NO**.

**Answer:** NO<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
