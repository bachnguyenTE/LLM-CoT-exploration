No, penguins do not fly. Penguins are birds that can fly, but they are not capable of sustained flight like many other birds. Their flight is controlled by a system called flippers, which allows them to fly for short periods during the season when it is most beneficial for their survival. However, their flight is not sustained and is temporary, similar to how many birds fly for a brief period and then return to their resting positions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
