Q: If two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two trains departing from a station in opposite directions. One train is going at 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which would be 30 miles per hour. The question is asking how far apart they are after 3 hours. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So, if one train is going 60 mph and the other is going 30 mph, their combined speed is 60 + 30, which is 90 mph. That makes sense because they're moving away from each other, so their speeds add up.

Now, the time they've been traveling is 3 hours. To find the distance between them, I can use the formula: distance = speed × time. So, plugging in the numbers, it should be 90 mph multiplied by 3 hours. Let me do that calculation: 90 × 3. Hmm, 90 times 3 is 270. So, is the answer 270 miles?

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. The first train is going 60 mph, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 60 × 3 = 180 miles. The second train is going 30 mph, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 30 × 3 = 90 miles. Since they're moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them is indeed 180 + 90, which is 279 miles. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
