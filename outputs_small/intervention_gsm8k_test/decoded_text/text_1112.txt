Q: Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Peter wants a quarter of that and Paul wants 1/3 of that. How many kilograms will James have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Then, Peter wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants one-third of that. The question is asking how many kilograms James will have left. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are four people: Pierre, Paul, Jacques, and Peter. They all bought apples together, totaling 12 kg. Then, Peter and Paul each want a portion of those apples, and the remaining amount is what James will have left. So, I need to calculate how much Peter and Paul want, add that up, and subtract it from the total to find out how much is left for James.

Alright, let's break it down. The total apples bought are 12 kg. Peter wants a quarter of that, and Paul wants one-third of that. So, I need to find out what a quarter of 12 kg is and what a third of 12 kg is.

Starting with Peter: a quarter of 12 kg. A quarter is the same as 1/4, right? So, to find a quarter of 12, I can multiply 12 by 1/4. Let me write that down:

Peter's share = 12 kg * (1/4)

Calculating that, 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Peter wants 3 kg of apples.

Now, moving on to Paul: he wants one-third of the 12 kg. A third is 1/3, so I need to multiply 12 by 1/3.

Paul's share = 12 kg * (1/3)

Calculating that, 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, Paul wants 4 kg of apples.

Alright, so Peter wants 3 kg, and Paul wants 4 kg. Now, I need to find out how much they both want in total. That would be the sum of Peter's share and Paul's share.

Total wanted by Peter and Paul = Peter's share + Paul's share
Total wanted = 3 kg + 4 kg

Adding those together, 3 plus 4 is 7. So, together, Peter and Paul want 7 kg of apples.

Now, the total apples bought were 12 kg, right? Wait, that seems right. 12 kg in total. So, if Peter and Paul want 7 kg, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
