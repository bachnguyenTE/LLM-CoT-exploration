Q: Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, how many pens does Sarah have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about pens owned by Timothy, George, and Sarah. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. The problem says:

"Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, how many pens does Sarah have?"

Alright, so first, I need to find out how many pens Sarah has. To do that, I think I should start by figuring out how many pens Timothy has because the problem relates Timothy's pens to George's. Then, once I know Timothy's number, I can find out Sarah's.

Let me write down what I know:

1. George has 18 pens.
2. Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
3. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.

So, starting with George, he has 18 pens. That's straightforward. Now, Timothy has three times that. So, if George has 18, then Timothy must have 3 multiplied by 18. Let me calculate that.

3 times 18... Hmm, 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 8 is 24, so 30 plus 24 is 54. So, Timothy has 54 pens.

Okay, now that I know Timothy has 54 pens, the next part is about Sarah. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, if Timothy has 54 pens, Sarah has half of that. Let me compute half of 54.

Half of 54 is 27, right? Because 54 divided by 2 is 27. So, Sarah has 27 pens.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, George has 18 pens. Then, Timothy has three times that, so 18 times 3 is 54. That makes sense. Then, Sarah has half of Timothy's pens, so 54 divided by 2 is 27. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. 18 times 3 is definitely 54, and 54 divided by 2 is 27. So, Sarah has 27 pens.

I guess another way to think about it is using variables. Let me try that to confirm.

Let G be the number of pens George has. So, G = 18.

Timothy has three times as many pens as George, so Timothy's pens, T, is 3G. So, T = 3*18 = 54.

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah's pens, S, is (1/2)*T. So, S = (1/2)*54 = 27.

Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using algebra, and it still gives me 27 pens for Sarah.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 27 pens.

**Final Answer**
Sarah has \boxed{27} pens.
</think>

George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, so Timothy has:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \text{ pens} \]

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, Sarah has \boxed{27} pens.
