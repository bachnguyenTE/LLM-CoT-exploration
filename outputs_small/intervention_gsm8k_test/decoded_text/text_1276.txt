Okay, so James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His fence is a rectangle, and the long side is 20 feet, while the short side is 15 feet. Hmm, I need to figure out how much crepe paper he needs to buy. 

First, I should visualize the fence. It's a rectangle, so it has two long sides and two short sides. The long sides are 20 feet each, and the short sides are 15 feet each. Now, crepe-paper streamers are usually used to hang decorations, so I think James is going to hang them from the posts or maybe from the corners of the fence. 

Wait, that seems right. If he's hanging streamers from the fence, they might be attached to the posts or maybe from the corners. But, that seems right. So, if he's hanging them from the corners, each corner would have a streamer. But, that seems right. So, each corner post would have a streamer going from one corner to the opposite corner. 

But, that seems right. So, each corner would have a streamer, and each streamer would be the diagonal of the rectangle. So, if the fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, the diagonal would be the length of each streamer. So, to find the length of each streamer, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. 

The Pythagorean theorem is a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the sides of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. In this case, the sides are 20 feet and 15 feet, so plugging those into the formula, we get 20^2 + 15^2 = c^2. 

Calculating that, 20 squared is 400, and 15 squared is 225. So, 400 + 225 is 625. So, c^2 is 625, which means c is the square root of 625. The square root of 625 is 25. So, each streamer is 25 feet long. 

But, that seems right. So, if each corner has a streamer, that's four corners, each with a 25-foot streamer. So, 4 times 25 is 100 feet. So, James needs to buy 100 feet of crepe paper. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If the fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, the diagonal is 25 feet. So, each streamer is 25 feet. Since there are four corners, each with a streamer, that's 4 times 25, which is 100 feet. So, yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, if he's hanging them from the posts, maybe he doesn't need four streamers, but, that seems right. If he's hanging them from the posts, each post would have a streamer going to the opposite post, but, that seems right. So, each streamer is 25 feet, and there are four posts, so 4 times 25 is 100 feet. 

Alternatively, if he's hanging them from the sides, maybe he's using two streamers per side, but, that seems right. So, each side is 20 feet, so each side would have two streamers, each 20 feet, so 2 times 20 is 40 feet per side. Since there are two sides, that's 80 feet. Similarly, the short sides are 15 feet each, so each side would have two streamers, each 15 feet, so 2 times 15 is 30 feet per side, and two sides would be 60 feet. So, total would be 80 plus 60, which is 140 feet. But, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if he's hanging them from the sides, each side would have two streamers, each 20 feet, so 40 feet per side, two sides would be 80 feet, and each short side would have two streamers, each 15 feet, so 30 feet per side, two sides would be 60 feet. So, total is 80 plus 60, which is 140 feet. 

But, that seems right. So, which is it? Is it 100 feet or 140 feet? Hmm. The question is, how many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy? So, the fence is a
