Q: It's strawberry-picking time on Grandma Concetta's farm.  Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?

Okay, so I have this problem about Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy picking strawberries on Grandma's farm. It's strawberry-picking time, which I guess means it's a good time to get some strawberries. The question is asking how many quarts of strawberries they can pick together per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony. So, if Tony is picking 6, Bobby must be picking 6 minus 1, which is 5 quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Since Bobby picks 5 quarts, Kathy must be picking 5 times 2, which is 10 quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. So, if Kathy is picking 10 quarts, then Ricky is picking 10 minus 2, which is 8 quarts per hour.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each person's rate:

1. Tony: 6 quarts/hour. That's straightforward.
2. Bobby: 1 less than Tony. 6 - 1 = 5. That makes sense.
3. Kathy: Twice as much as Bobby. 5 * 2 = 10. Yep, that's correct.
4. Ricky: 2 fewer than Kathy. 10 - 2 = 8. That seems right too.

Now, to find the total number of quarts they can pick together per hour, I need to add up all their individual rates. So, let's add them up:

Tony: 6
Bobby: 5
Kathy: 10
Ricky: 8

Adding them together: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8.

Let me compute that step by step:

6 + 5 is 11.

11 + 10 is 21.

21 + 8 is 29.

Wait, that seems right. So, 6 + 5 is 11, 11 +10 is 21, 21 +8 is 29. So, the total is 29 quarts per hour.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Tony: 6
Bobby: 5 (which is 6 -1)
Kathy: 10 (which is 5*2)
Ricky: 8 (which is 10 -2)

Adding them: 6 +5 is 11, 11 +10 is 21, 21 +8 is 29. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total is 29 quarts per hour.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Maybe I should write it out in a table to make sure.

Person | Rate (quarts/hour)
--- | ---
Tony | 6
Bobby | 5
Kathy | 10
Ricky | 8

Total: 6 +5 +10 +8.

6 +5 is 11, 11 +10 is 21, 21 +8 is 29. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can add them in a different order to see if I get the same result.

Let's try adding 6 and 8 first: 6 +8 is 14.

Then, 5 +10 is 15.

Then, 14 +15 is 29. Wait, that seems right. 14 +15 is 29. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
