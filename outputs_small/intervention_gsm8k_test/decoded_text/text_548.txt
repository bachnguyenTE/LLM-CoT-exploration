Q: Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Mark was unwell for 3 months, and during that time, he lost 10 pounds each month. His final weight was 70 pounds. I need to find out what his initial weight was. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mark lost weight over 3 months, losing 10 pounds each month. After those 3 months, he weighed 70 pounds. So, I need to figure out how much he weighed before he started losing weight. That means I need to reverse the process of weight loss to find the starting weight.

Alright, so if he lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's a total weight loss. Let me calculate that first. If he lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months, that's 10 * 3. Let me write that down:

Total weight loss = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. 10 times 3 is 30. So, he lost a total of 30 pounds over the 3 months.

Now, his final weight is 70 pounds. That means after losing 30 pounds, he ended up at 70 pounds. So, to find his initial weight, I need to add the total weight loss back to his final weight.

Let me write that as an equation:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight loss.

Plugging in the numbers:

Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds.

Hmm, 70 plus 30 is 107. So, his initial weight was 107 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 10 pounds per month for 3 months is 30 pounds. Adding that to his final weight of 70 pounds gives 107 pounds. Yeah, that makes sense.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using algebra. Let me denote his initial weight as W. He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. Therefore, his final weight is W - 30 = 70 pounds.

So, solving for W: W = 70 + 30 = 100 pounds. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
