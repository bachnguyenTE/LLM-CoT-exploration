Q: Carl’s favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total this week. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the information given:

1. **Lunch:** Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch. He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so that means he ate 7 sandwiches for lunch. Each sandwich used 2 slices, so the total cheese used for lunch is 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

2. **Breakfast:** He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. For each of these days, he used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since each sandwich used 2 slices, each omelet must have used 2 + 1 = 3 slices. So, each omelet day, he used 3 slices. Over 3 days, that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:** He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Now, to find the total cheese used, I need to add up the cheese used for lunch, breakfast, and the macaroni and cheese dish.

Let me write that down:

Total cheese = Cheese for lunch + Cheese for breakfast + Cheese for macaroni and cheese

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cheese = 14 + 9 + 8

Let me add them up step by step.

First, 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) = 23

Then, 23 (from the previous addition) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31

Wait, that seems right. 14 + 9 is 23, and 23 + 8 is 31. So, 31 slices of cheese in total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check each part.

- **Lunch:** 7 sandwiches * 2 slices = 14. That's correct.
- **Breakfast:** 3 days * 3 slices = 9. That's correct.
- **Macaroni and Cheese:** 8 slices. That's given.

Adding them together: 14 + 9 = 13, then 13 + 8 = 21. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
