Q: The highest temperature ever recorded in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature ever recorded in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature recorded in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. What is the average highest temperature of these 3 countries?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the average highest temperature of three countries: Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia. Let me see, the highest temperatures they've ever recorded are -48 degrees Fahrenheit for Southlandia, 21 degrees Fahrenheit for Northlandia, and -3 degrees Fahrenheit for Midlandia. Hmm, I need to find the average of these three temperatures.

Alright, first things first, I remember that to find an average, you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are. In this case, there are three countries, so I'll add up their highest temperatures and then divide by 3. That makes sense.

Let me write down the temperatures to make it clearer. Southlandia is -48°F, Northlandia is 21°F, and Midlandia is -3°F. So, I need to add these three together. Let me do the math step by step.

Starting with the first two: -48°F and 21°F. Adding those together, I think it's like subtracting 48 from 21, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, -48 + 21. Let me visualize this on a number line. Starting at -48, if I add 21, I move 21 units to the right. So, from -48, moving 21 units would land me at -27, right? Because 48 minus 21 is 47, so it's -47, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, -48 + 21 is -27.

Now, I need to add the third temperature, which is -3°F, to this result. So, -27 + (-3). Hmm, adding a negative is like subtracting. So, that would be -27 - 3, which is -10. Wait, that seems right. So, the total sum of the three temperatures is -10°F.

Now, to find the average, I have to divide this total by the number of countries, which is 3. So, -10 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. -10 ÷ 3 is approximately -3.3333... So, that's -3.3333... degrees Fahrenheit.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my addition. So, -48 + 21 is indeed -27, and then -27 + (-3) is -10. So, the total is -10. Divided by 3 is -3.3333... So, that's -3 and 1/3 degrees Fahrenheit.

Is there a way to express that as a fraction? Well, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333, so yeah, that's correct. So, the average temperature is -3.3333°F.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. If I have three temperatures: -48, 21, and -3. Adding them up: -48 + 21 is -27, then -27 + (-3) is -30? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
