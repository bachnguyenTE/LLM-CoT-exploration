Q: Out of the 150 teachers on the school basketball court, 60% are history teachers. If the rest of the teachers on the court are math teachers, and each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the number of history teachers by calculating 60% of 150, which equals 93.

Next, find the number of math teachers by subtracting the history teachers from the total number of teachers: 150 - 93 = 57.

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total sleep time for all math teachers, multiply the number of math teachers by the hours they sleep: 57 * 6 = 342 hours.

Therefore, the math teachers collectively spend 342 hours sleeping in one day.

**Solution:**

We are given:
- Total number of teachers on the school basketball court: 150
- Percentage of history teachers: 60%

**Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers.**

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 33
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of math teachers.**

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{History teachers} = 150 - 33 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers.**

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day.

\[
\text{Total sleep time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Sleep hours per teacher} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{720}
\]
