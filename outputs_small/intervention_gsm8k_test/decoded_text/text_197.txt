Okay, so I have this problem here about the city of Soda. Let me read it again: there are 23,786 inhabitants in Soda. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. The rest are children. I need to find out how many kids there are in Soda. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the total population is the sum of men, women, and children. So, if I have the total and the number of men and women, I can subtract those two from the total to get the number of children. That makes sense because if I add up all the men, women, and kids, it should equal the total population.

Let me write that down as an equation. Let me denote the total population as T, the number of men as M, the number of women as W, and the number of children as C. So, the equation would be:

T = M + W + C

I need to find C, so I can rearrange the equation:

C = T - M - W

Alright, plugging in the numbers. The total population T is 23,786. The number of men M is 8,417, and the number of women W is 9,092. So, substituting these values into the equation:

C = 23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092

Now, I need to compute this. Let me do the subtraction step by step. First, subtract the number of men from the total population. So, 23,786 minus 8,417. Hmm, let me write that down:

23,786
- 8,417
________

Starting from the rightmost digit: 6 minus 7. Hmm, I can't do that, so I need borrow from the next digit. The 8 becomes 7, and the 6 becomes 16. So, 16 minus 7 is 9. Next digit: 7 minus 1 is 6. Then, 3 minus 4. Again, can't do that, so I need borrow from the next digit. The 2 becomes 1, and the 3 becomes 13. So, 13 minus 4 is 9. Then, the next digit: 1 minus 8. Wait, that seems right. So, 1 minus 8. Hmm, I can't do that, so I have to borrow from the next digit, which is the ten-thousands place. The 2 becomes 1, and the 1 becomes 11. So, 11 minus 8 is 3. So, putting it all together, that gives me 15,299.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 23,786 minus 8,417. Let me do it another way. 23,786 minus 8,000 is 15,786. Then, subtract 417 more. 15,786 minus 400 is 15,386. Then, subtract 17 more: 15,386 minus 17 is 15,369. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me try another way.

Alternatively, 23,786 minus 8,417. Let's subtract digit by digit:

Starting from the units place: 6 - 7. Can't do that, borrow 1 from the tens place. So, 16 - 7 = 9.

Tens place: 7 became 6 after borrowing, so 6 - 1 = 5. Wait, that seems right. 8,417: the tens digit is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5.

Hundreds place: 7 - 4 = 3.

Thousands place: 3 - 8. Can't do that, so borrow from the ten-thousands place. So, 13 - 8 = 5.

Ten-thousands place: 2 became 1 after borrowing, so 1 - 0 = 1.

So, putting it all together: 15,299. Wait, that seems right. So, 23,786 - 8,417 = 15,299.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check with another method. 8,417 + 15,299. Let's add them up.

8,417 + 1
