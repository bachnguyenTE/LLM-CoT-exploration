Q: Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Duncan is currently 60 years old. Eight years ago, that would be 60 - 8 = 52 years old. So, eight years ago, Duncan was 52. The problem says that this age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if I let Adam's current age be A, then four years ago, he was A - 4 years old. According to the problem, 52 is equal to two times that age. So, I can write an equation: 52 = 2*(A - 4). 

Let me write that down:

52 = 2*(A - 4)

Now, I need to solve for A. Let me do that step by step. First, I can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to simplify it. So, 52 divided by 2 is 26. So, 26 = A - 4. Then, to solve for A, I can add 4 to both sides. So, 26 + 4 = A, which means A = 30. 

Wait, that seems right. So, Adam is currently 30 years old. The question is asking how old Adam will be in 8 years. So, if he's 30 now, in 8 years he'll be 33. So, the answer should be 33.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with Duncan's age eight years ago: 60 - 8 = 52. That's correct. The problem says that was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if Adam's age four years ago was A - 4, then 52 = 2*(A -4). Solving that: 52 divided by 2 is 26, so 26 = A -4. Adding 4 to both sides: 26 + 4 = 30. So, A is 30. Therefore, in 8 years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
