Q: James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons.  One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger.  A pack of 5 candles costs $3.  How much does James spend on candles?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so James wants to buy birthday candles for his two sons. One of them is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Hmm, let me figure out how old the younger son is first. If the older one is 12, then subtracting 4 years gives me 8. So, the younger son is 8 years old. 

Now, James needs candles for both of them. I guess he needs one set of candles for each son. The problem says a pack of 5 candles costs $3. So, I need to figure out how many packs he needs in total and then calculate the cost.

First, let's see how many packs are needed. Each pack has 5 candles, so for each son, he needs a pack. Since there are two sons, that's 2 packs. Each pack costs $3, so 2 packs would cost 2 times $3. Let me write that down: 2 packs * $3 per pack = $6. 

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me double-check. The older son is 12, the younger is 8. Each needs a pack of 5 candles. So, 5 candles for the older and 5 for the younger. That's 10 candles in total. Each pack is 5, so 10 divided by 5 is 2 packs. So, 2 packs at $3 each is indeed $6. 

Is there any other way to think about this? Maybe, but, that seems right. So, James spends $6 on candles. 

**Final Answer**
James spends \boxed{6} dollars on candles.

James wants to buy birthday candles for his two sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, making him 8 years old. Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3.

To determine how many packs James needs, we note that each son requires a pack. Since there are two sons, James needs 2 packs. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
2 \text{ packs} \times \$3 \text{ per pack} = \$6
\]

Thus, James spends \boxed{6} dollars on candles.
