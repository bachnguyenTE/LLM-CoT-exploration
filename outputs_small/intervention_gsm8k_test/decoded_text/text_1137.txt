Q: Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Donny and his water bottles. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Wait, that seems right. He has two mugs of water. One mug is at 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature. He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug. After that, he can drink the water. The question is asking for the minimum temperature of the second mug. So, we need to find the least possible temperature that the second mug can be, given that after pouring, both mugs are at least 40 degrees.

Let me break this down. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as T degrees. So, Donny has two mugs: one at 33 degrees and another at T degrees. He pours 4 ounces from the first mug into his bottle and 1 ounce from the second mug. After pouring, both mugs are still at least 40 degrees. So, we need to find the minimum T such that after pouring, the second mug is still above 40 degrees.

Wait, that seems right. So, the second mug is being poured 1 ounce, so its temperature after pouring would be T - 1. But, that seems right. So, T - 1 must be at least 40 degrees. So, T - 1 >= 40. Therefore, T >= 41 degrees. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is the answer 41 degrees? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
