Okay, so I have this problem here about Bryce and his four friends who each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. Each pizza has 12 slices. The question is asking how many slices of pizza were left after everyone ate. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are five people in total: Bryce and four friends. Each pizza has 12 slices. So, each person starts with a whole pizza, which is 12 slices. Then, some of them ate more than others. Specifically, Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, while the other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. I need to find out how many slices were left after everyone had eaten.

Alright, so maybe I should break this down into parts. Let me think about each person's consumption and then see how much is left.

Starting with the pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are five pizzas in total (one for each person). So, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices. But, that seems right. So, if I can figure out how many slices were eaten, I can subtract that from 60 to find the remaining slices.

But, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate how many slices each person ate and then add them up. Let me try that approach.

So, let's list out each person:

1. Bryce
2. Friend 1
3. Friend 2
4. Friend 3
5. Friend 4

Each of these five people has a pizza with 12 slices.

Now, according to the problem:

- Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
- The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

So, let me assign each person to the group they belong to.

Group 1: Bryce and Friend 1 (since they ate 2/3)
Group 2: Friend 2 and Friend 3 (since they ate 3/4)
Group 3: Friend 4 (since they didn't eat any extra, just 1/3 or something?)

Wait, that seems right. So, Group 1 ate 2/3, Group 2 ate 3/4, and Group 3 only ate 1/3? Wait, that seems right. Because the problem says "Bryce and two friends" ate 2/3, and the "remaining two friends" ate 3/4. So, the last two friends only ate 3/4.

So, let me confirm:

- Group 1: 2/3 of their pizza
- Group 2: 3/4 of their pizza
- Group 3: 1/3 of their pizza

Wait, that seems right. So, each person in Group 1 ate 2/3, each in Group 2 ate 3/4, and each in Group 3 ate 1/3.

So, let me calculate how many slices each group ate.

First, Group 1: 2/3 of 12 slices. So, 12 * 2/3. Let me compute that.

12 * 2 = 24, divided by 3 is 8. So, Group 1 ate 8 slices.

Group 2: 3/4 of 12 slices. So, 12 * 3/4. 12 * 3 = 36, divided by 4 is 9. So, Group 2 ate 9 slices.

Group 3: 1/3 of 12 slices. 12 * 1/3 is 4. So, Group 3 ate 4 slices.

Now, let me add up the slices eaten by each group.

Group 1: 8 slices

Group 2: 9 slices

Group 3: 4 slices

Total eaten: 8 + 9 + 4 = 21 slices.

Wait, that seems right. 8 + 9 is 17, plus 4 is 21. So, 21 slices eaten in total.

But, that seems right. So, total slices eaten is 21, so total slices left would be 60 - 21 = 39 slices.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 pizzas, each 12 slices, so 60 slices. If 21 slices were eaten, then 60 - 21 = 49 slices left? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
