Q: Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?

Okay, so Bob needs potting soil for his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet and costs $12. I need to figure out how much the potting soil will cost him.

First, I should probably calculate the volume of one raised bed because that will tell me how much soil each bed needs. The bed is a rectangular prism, so the volume is length times width times height. Let me write that down:

Volume of one bed = length × width × height

Given the dimensions, the length is 8 feet, the width is 2 feet, and the height is 2 feet. So plugging those numbers in:

Volume = 8 ft × 2 ft × 2 ft

Let me compute that. 8 times 2 is 16, and 16 times 2 is 12. So each bed holds 12 cubic feet of soil.

Wait, that seems right. 8 times 2 is 16, and 16 times 2 is 12. Yeah, 12 cubic feet per bed.

Now, Bob has 10 beds. So the total volume needed is 12 cubic feet per bed times 10 beds. Let me calculate that:

Total volume = 12 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds = 120 cubic feet.

So he needs 120 cubic feet of potting soil in total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, and each bag costs $12. So I need to figure out how many bags he needs to buy to get 120 cubic feet.

To find the number of bags, I can divide the total volume by the volume per bag:

Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag

So that's 120 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag. Let me compute that:

120 ÷ 2 = 60.

So he needs 60 bags of potting soil.

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is 60 bags × $12 per bag. Let me calculate that:

60 × 12 = 120.

So the total cost is $120.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, volume per bed: 8 × 2 × 2 = 12 cubic feet. That's correct.

Total volume for 10 beds: 12 × 10 = 20 cubic feet. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
