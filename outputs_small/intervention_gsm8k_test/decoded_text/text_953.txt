Q: Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Kim and her sleep. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. So that's a total of 8 hours. Let me convert that into minutes because the answer needs to be in minutes. 8 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 480 minutes. So, she sleeps for 480 minutes a day.

Now, on this particular day, she found a camera and decided to sleepwalk. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am. Wait, that seems right. So, she started sleepwalking at 2:15 am and ended at 2:38 am. I need to find out how long she was asleep on her bed that day.

But, that seems right. She usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. But, that seems right. So, she usually sleeps 480 minutes.

But, that seems right. So, on this day, she woke up earlier. She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she went to the bathroom at 2:10 am instead of 2:15 am. So, she started sleepwalking at 2:10 am? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she started sleepwalking at 2:15 am, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
