Q: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of money Kelly has. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters amount to 5 multiplied by 25, which is 125 cents. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes amount to 2 multiplied by 10, which is 20 cents. Adding these together, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Next, she spends 55 cents on a can of pop. To find out how much money she has left, I subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount. So, 145 cents minus 55 cents equals 130 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 130 cents left after her purchase.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has:**
   
   - **Quarters:** Kelly has 5 quarters.
     \[
     5 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 = 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents}
     \]
   
   - **Dimes:** Kelly has 2 dimes.
     \[
     2 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10 = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]
   
   - **Total money:**
     \[
     125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Subtract the cost of the can of pop:**
   
   - **Cost of the can of pop:** 55 cents
   \[
   145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
