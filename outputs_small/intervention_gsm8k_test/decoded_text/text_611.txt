Q: John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much John's research cost was. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

John starts with $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. Then, his research ends up taking 10 times that long. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then, the research takes 10 times that long. I think that means the total research time is 10 times the initial 5 months. So, 10 times 5 is 50 months? Wait, that seems right. So, the total research time is 50 months.

But, that seems right. Let me confirm. If the initial funding is for the first 5 months, and then the research takes 10 times that long, so 5 * 10 = 50 months. So, total research time is 50 months.

Now, the funding per month after the first 5 months is 50% more. So, the first 5 months are $100,000. Then, starting from the 6th month, each month the funding increases by 50%. So, each month after the first 5, the funding is 1.5 times the previous month.

So, the total cost is the initial 5 months plus the sum of the funding from month 6 onwards for the remaining 50 - 5 = 45 months.

Wait, that seems right. So, the first 5 months are $100,000. Then, from month 6 to month 55 (since 50 months total), each month the funding is 50% more than the previous month.

So, the funding for each month after the first 5 is 1.5 times the previous month. So, this is a geometric series where the first term is the funding for month 6, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 1.5.

So, let me structure this.

Total cost = initial funding + sum of the monthly funding from month 6 to month 55.

So, initial funding is $100,000.

Then, the monthly funding from month 6 onwards is a geometric series with first term a = funding for month 6, and common ratio r = 1.5, for n = 45 months.

Wait, that seems right. So, the number of months after the first 5 is 55 - 5 = 50 months, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 50 months after the first 5, so 50 months in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total funding after the first 5 months is the sum of a geometric series with 50 terms, each term being 1.5 times the previous.

So, the formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a1 * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

So, in this case, a1 is the funding for month 6, which is 1.5 times the initial funding. Wait, that seems right. So, the initial funding is $100,000, so the funding for month 6 is 1.5 * 100,000 = $150,000.

So, a1 = $150,000, r = 1.5, n = 50 months.

Wait, that seems right. So, the sum S = 150,000 * (1.5^50 - 1)/(1.5 - 1). Let me compute that.

But, that seems right. So, the total cost is 100,000 + S.

But, that seems right. So, let me compute S.

First, compute 1.5^50. That's a huge number. Let me see, 1.5^10 is approximately 1.5^10. Let me compute that.

1.5^1 = 1.5

1.5^2 = 2.25

1.5^3 = 3.375

1.5^4 = 5.0625

1.5^5 = 7.59375

1.5^6 = 11.3996875

1.5^7 = 20.98044375

1.5^8 = 31.4722
