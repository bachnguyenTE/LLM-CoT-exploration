Okay, so Tim is planning to light off fireworks for the Fourth of July. Let me try to figure out how much he spent in total. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, he buys a package of fireworks worth $400. Then, he buys another pack that's twice as much. So, the second package must be 2 times $400. Let me calculate that. 2 multiplied by 400 is... 800. So, the second package is $800. 

Now, he also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Wait, that seems right. So, he has three items: the first package, the second package, and the finale. 

But, that seems right. So, the total before the discount would be the sum of these three. Let me add them up. 

First, 400 plus 800. Hmm, 400 plus 800. Let me do that. 400 + 800 is 1280. Wait, that seems right. 400 + 800 is 1280. Then, he adds the finale which is 150. So, 1280 plus 150. Let me add those. 1280 + 150 is 1333. So, the total before the discount is $1333.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he gets a 20% discount on the total. So, he's going to pay 80% of the total amount because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, I need to calculate 80% of $1333.

Hmm, how do I calculate 80% of 1333? Well, 10% of 1333 is 13.33, so 80% would be 8 times that. Let me compute 13.33 times 8. 13.33 times 8. 10 times 8 is 80, 3 times 8 is 24, 0.33 times 8 is 2.64. So, adding those together: 80 + 24 is 104, plus 2.64 is 106.64. So, 80% of 1333 is $106.64.

Wait, that seems right. So, the discount is $106.64. So, the total amount he has to pay is the original total minus the discount. So, 1333 minus 106.64. Let me do that subtraction.

1333 minus 106.64. Let me write it down:

1333.00
-106.64
________

Starting from the right, 0 minus 4, can't do that, so borrow from the left. The 0 becomes 10, and the 3 becomes 2. So, 10 minus 4 is 6. Next, 2 minus 6, can't do that, so borrow again. The 2 becomes 12, and the 3 becomes 2. 12 minus 6 is 6. Next, 2 minus 0 is 2. Then, 1 minus 1 is 0. So, the result is 1266.36.

Wait, that seems right. So, 1333 minus 106.64 is 1226.36. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount he has to pay is $1226.36.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do mental math, I might make a mistake.

So, original total was 1333. 20% of 1333 is 266.6, so 10% is 133.3, so 20% is 266.6. So, 1333 minus 266.6 is 1066.4. Wait, that seems right. So, 1333 minus 266.6 is 1066.4. Wait, that seems right. So, 10% is 133.3, so 20% is 266.6. So, 1333 minus 266.6 is 1066.4.
