Q: Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Carla is making cookies today and tomorrow, and I need to figure out how many cups of flour she'll need. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. A dozen is 12 cookies, right? So, for every 12 cookies, Carla needs 2 cups of flour. That makes sense.

Now, Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. I need to find out how much flour she needs in total for both days. Hmm, okay. So, maybe I should figure out how much flour is needed for each day separately and then add them together.

Let me start with today. She's making 36 cookies. Since a dozen is 12, I can figure out how many dozens are in 36 cookies. To do that, I can divide 36 by 12. Let me write that down:

36 ÷ 12 = ?

Hmm, 12 times 3 is 36, so that means 36 cookies are 3 dozen. So, 36 cookies equal 3 dozen. Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, then 3 dozen would require 3 times 2 cups. Let me calculate that:

3 × 2 = 6

So, Carla needs 6 cups of flour today.

Okay, now moving on tomorrow. She's making 30 cookies. Again, I need to figure out how many dozens that is. So, 30 divided by 12. Let me do that division:

30 ÷ 12 = ?

Hmm, 12 times 2 is 24, and 12 times 3 is 36. So, 30 is between 2 and 3 dozens. Let me see, 12 × 2 = 24, so 30 - 24 = 6. So, 30 cookies are 2 dozen and 6 cookies, which is 2.5 dozen. Wait, that seems right. 12 × 2.5 is 30. Yeah, because 2.5 × 12 is 30.

So, 30 cookies are 2.5 dozen. Since each dozen requires 2 cups, then 2.5 dozen would require 2.5 × 2 cups. Let me compute that:

2.5 × 2 = 5

So, Carla needs 5 cups of flour tomorrow.

Now, to find the total amount of of flour she needs for both days, I just add the flour needed for today and tomorrow together. So, 6 cups for today plus 5 cups for tomorrow.

6 + 5 = 11

So, Carla needs a total of 11 cups of flour.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, for today: 36 cookies. 36 divided by 12 is 3. 3 times 2 is 6. That's correct.

For tomorrow: 30 cookies. 30 divided by 12 is 2.5. 2.5 times 2 is 5. That's also correct.

Adding them together: 6 + 5 is 11. Yep, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since two cups make a dozen, how many dozens are 36 and 30?

For 36: 36 ÷12 =3, so 3×2=6.

For 30: 30 ÷12=2.5, so 2.5×2=5.

Total: 6+5=11.

Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of cups per cookie. If two cups make 12 cookies, then each cookie requires 2 ÷12 cups, which is 1/6 cups per cookie.

So, for today: 36 cookies × (1/6) cups per cookie = 36 × (1/6) = 6 cups.

For tomorrow: 30 cookies × (1/6) cups per cookie = 30 × (1/6) = 5 cups.

Total: 6 +5=11.

Same answer. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the ratio of cookies to flour. For every 12 cookies, 2 cups. So, the ratio is 12 cookies : 2 cups, which simplifies to 6 cookies : 1 cup.

So, for 36 cookies, how many cups? Since 6 cookies require 1 cup, 36 cookies would require 3
