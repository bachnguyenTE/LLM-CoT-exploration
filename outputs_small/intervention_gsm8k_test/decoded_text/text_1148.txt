Q: Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Chatty has three dozen eggs, and she wants to give the same number of eggs to each of her four children. Hmm, let me figure out how to solve this. First, I need to understand what a dozen means. I think a dozen is 12 eggs. So, three dozen would be 3 times 12. Let me write that down: 3 × 12. That should give me the total number of eggs.

Calculating that, 3 × 12 is 36. Wait, that seems right. So, Chatty has 36 eggs in total. Now, she wants to distribute these equally among her four children. So, I need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. That would be 36 divided by 4.

Let me do that division. 36 ÷ 4. Hmm, 4 goes into 36 nine times because 4 × 9 is 36. So, 36 divided by 4 is 9. Wait, that seems right. So, each child would get 9 eggs. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again, three dozen is 36 eggs. Divided by four children, that's 36 ÷ 4. 4 times 9 is 36, so yes, that's correct. So, each child gets 9 eggs. I think that's the answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions? If each child gets an equal share, then each child gets 36/4, which is 9. Yeah, that's the same result. So, both methods give me 9 eggs per child. I think that's solid.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 9 eggs per child. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward division. Three dozen is 36, divided by four is 9. Yeah, that's correct.

I guess another way to think about it is, if each child gets 9 eggs, then four children would get 4 × 9, which is 36. That matches the total number of eggs. So, that checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 9 eggs per child.

**Final Answer**
Each child receives \boxed{9} eggs.

Chatty has three dozen eggs, which is equivalent to \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs. She wants to distribute these eggs equally among her four children. To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

\[
36 \div 4 = 9
\]

Thus, each child receives \(\boxed{9}\) eggs.
