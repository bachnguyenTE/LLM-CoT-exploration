Q: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards. That seems straightforward. Then, after a month, she collected three times that number. Hmm, okay, so if she had 20 initially, three times that would be... let me calculate that. 3 times 20 is 60. So, after the first month, she has 20 plus 60, which is 82 cards. Wait, that seems right. 20 plus 60 is 82. Okay, so after the first month, she has 82.

Now, moving on to the second month. She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. Hmm, so she collected 60 in the first month, right? So, 20 fewer would be 60 minus 20. Let me do that subtraction. 60 minus 20 is 40. So, in the second month, she collected 40 cards. Got it. So, adding that to her previous total, she now has 82 plus 40. Let me add those together. 82 plus 40 is 122. So, after the second month, she has 122 cards.

Now, onto the third month. She collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. Okay, so first, I need to find out how many she collected in the first and second months combined. From the first month, she collected 60, and the second month, 40. So, 60 plus 40 is 100. So, twice that combined number would be 2 times 100, which is 200. So, in the third month, she collected 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of Pokemon cards she has now, I need to add up all the cards she collected over the three months. So, initially, she had 20. Then, she collected 60 in the first month, 40 in the second, and 200 in the third. So, adding all those together: 20 plus 60 is 80, plus 40 is 120, plus 200 is 320. So, in total, she has 320 Pokemon cards now.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 20, adding 60 gives 80. Then, adding 40 gives 120. Then, adding 200 gives 320. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 320.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{320}

Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After the first month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards. Adding this to her initial amount, she now has \(20 + 60 = 82\) cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. This is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards. Adding this to her previous total, she now has \(82 + 40 = 122\) cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Twice this amount is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards. Adding this to her previous total, she now has \(122 + 200 = 320\) cards.

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{320}\).
