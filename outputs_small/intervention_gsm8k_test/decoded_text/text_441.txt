Q: Two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, bought beads. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?

Okay, so I have this problem here about two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, who bought beads. The question is asking how many more beads one sister has than the other, and each pack contains 20 beads. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack has 20 beads. So, I need to calculate the total number of beads each sister has and then find the difference between them.

Let me start with Elizabeth. She bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. So, how many packs in total did she buy? That's 1 + 2, which is 3 packs. Since each pack has 20 beads, the total number of beads Elizabeth has is 3 packs multiplied by 20 beads per pack. Let me write that down:

Elizabeth's beads = 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Wait, that seems right. 1 pack is 20 beads, 2 packs would be 40 beads, so 20 + 40 is 60. Yeah, that checks out.

Now, Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, how many packs did she buy in total? That's 3 + 4, which is 7 packs. Each pack has 20 beads, so her total beads would be 7 packs multiplied by 20 beads per pack.

Let me calculate that: 7 * 20. Hmm, 7 times 20 is 140. So, Margareth has 140 beads.

Wait, that seems right. 3 packs of blue beads would be 60 beads, and 4 packs of red beads would be 80 beads, so 60 + 80 is 140. Yep, that's correct.

Now, the question is asking how many more beads one sister has than the other. So, I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. Elizabeth has 60 beads, Margareth has 140 beads. So, 140 - 60 is 80.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For Elizabeth: 1 pack red + 2 packs clear = 3 packs. 3 * 20 = 60. Correct.

For Margareth: 3 packs blue + 4 packs red = 7 packs. 7 * 20 = 140. Correct.

Difference: 140 - 60 = 80. Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer should be 80 beads.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I could calculate the total beads for each sister by considering the number of packs and then multiplying by 20.

For Elizabeth: 1 red + 2 clear = 3 packs. 3 * 20 = 60.

For Margareth: 3 blue + 4 red = 7 packs. 7 * 20 = 140.

Difference: 140 - 60 = 80.

Same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of variables. Let me denote the number of red beads as R, clear beads as C, blue beads as B, and so on.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I can write equations.

Let me define:

Let R = number of red bead packs.

C = number of clear bead packs.

B = number of blue bead packs.

Given that:

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear. So, R =1, C=2.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red. So, B=3, R=4.

Each pack has 20 beads.

So, total beads for Elizabeth: R + C = 1 + 2 = 3 packs. 3 *20=60.

Total beads for Margareth: B + R =3 +4=7 packs. 7*20=140.

Difference:140 -60=80.

Same answer. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 80 beads.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 80.
