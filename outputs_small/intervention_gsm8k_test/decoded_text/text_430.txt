Okay, so Charlotte went to the kitchen supply store and wanted some items. Let me see, she wanted a set of pots and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 separate utensils that were each $5.00 each. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how much her order was before and after the 20% discount.

First, let me break down the cost of each item she wanted. The pots and pans are $120.00, the mixing bowls are $20.00, and the utensils are 5 items at $5.00 each. So, I should calculate the total cost before any discount.

Starting with the pots and pans: that's straightforward, it's $120.00. Then the mixing bowls are $20.00. So, adding those together: $120.0 + $20.00. Let me do that math. 120 plus 20 is 140, so that's $140.00 so far.

Now, the utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each. So, 5 times 5 is 25. So, the utensils cost $25.00. Adding that to the previous total: $140.00 + $25.00. Let me add those: 140 plus 25 is 165. So, the total before discount is $165.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, $120 for pots and pans, $20 for bowls, and 5*$5 is $25, so 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. So, $167.00 total before discount.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check: 120 + 20 is 140, plus 25 is 165. Wait, that seems right. So, 120 + 20 is 140, plus 25 is 165. So, $165.00 total before discount.

Now, the clerk told her everything was 20% off. So, she needs to subtract 20% from the total. So, 20% of $165.00 is how much? Let me calculate that.

20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal. So, 0.20 multiplied by 165. Let me do that: 0.20 * 165. 0.2 times 100 is 20, 0.2 times 60 is 12, 0.2 times 5 is 1. So, 20 + 12 + 1 is 33. So, 20% of 165 is $33.00.

So, the discount is $33.00. Therefore, the total after discount is the original total minus the discount. So, $165.00 minus $33.00 is $132.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify: 165 minus 33 is 132. So, $132.00 total after discount.

But, that seems right. So, Charlotte's order was $165.00 before discount, and after 20% off, it's $132.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, calculate the cost of each item:

- Pots and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding them up: 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. So, $167.00 total before discount.

Wait, that seems right. 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. So, $167.00 total before discount.

Wait, that seems right. So, 120 + 20 is 142, plus 25 is 167. So, $
