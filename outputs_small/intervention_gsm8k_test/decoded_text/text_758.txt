Q: A bag has a 5% discount. If it is marked $140, how much will you pay after the discount?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate 5% of $140 to determine the discount amount.

To find 5% of $144, I can multiply 144 by 0.05.

144 multiplied by 0.0 is 14.4, and 144 multiplied by 0.0 is another 14.4.

Adding these together gives a total discount of $28.80.

Next, I subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to pay.

$144 minus $28.80 equals $115.20.

Therefore, after applying the 5% discount, the final amount to pay is $115.20.

**Solution:**

We need to calculate the final amount to pay after applying a 5% discount to the original price of \$144.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 5\% \times \$144 = 0.05 \times 144 = \$28.80
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**
   
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = \$144 - \$28.80 = \$115.20
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$115.20}
\]
