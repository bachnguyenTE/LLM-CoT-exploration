Q: A clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, and 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a clothing store with white shirts and floral shirts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Hmm, so that's a total of 40 + 50 shirts, which is 90 shirts altogether. But, that seems right. Now, the problem says half of the white shirts have collars. So, half of 40 is... let me calculate that. Half of 40 is 20, right? So, 22 white shirts have collars, and the other half, which is also 22, don't have collars. Got that.

Then, it says 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. So, out of 55 floral shirts, 22 don't have buttons. Wait, that seems right. So, 22 floral shirts have buttons, and 22 don't. 

Now, the question is asking: How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars? Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the number of floral shirts without buttons and subtract the number of white shirts without collars. 

Let me break it down. First, let's find the number of white shirts without collars. We know there are 44 white shirts in total, and 22 have collars. So, 44 minus 22 is 22. So, 22 white shirts don't have collars. 

Next, let's find the number of floral shirts without buttons. There are 55 floral shirts in total, and 22 have buttons. So, 55 minus 22 is 33. So, 33 floral shirts don't have buttons. 

Now, the question is asking how many more floral shirts without buttons are there than white shirts without collars. So, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons. That would be 33 minus 22. 

Wait, that seems right. 33 minus 22 is 11. So, there is 1 more floral shirt without buttons than white shirts without collars. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Total white shirts: 44. Collars: 22. So, no collars: 44 -22=22. That's correct. 

Total floral shirts:55. Buttons:22. So, no buttons:55 -22=33. That's correct. 

Difference:33 -22=1. Yeah, that seems right. 

So, the answer should be 1. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is 1 more than the number of white shirts without collars. 

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 1.

The number of floral shirts without buttons is 33, and the number of white shirts without collars is 22. Therefore, there is 1 more floral shirt without buttons than white shirts without collars.
