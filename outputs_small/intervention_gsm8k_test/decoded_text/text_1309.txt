Okay, so I have this problem here where a group of girls is trying to raise money for a carnival. The question is asking how much money they all raised in total. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says:

"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?"

Wait, that seems right. So, there are four people: Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah. Each of them raises some amount of money, and we have specific amounts given for two of them, and we need to find the total.

Let me list out the information:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.

So, we need to find the total amount raised by all four girls. That means I need to calculate how much each person raised and then add them all together.

Let me start by writing down each person's contribution.

First, Alexandra: She raises $430. That's straightforward.

Next, Kim: She raises $320 more than Alexandra. So, if Alexandra is $430, then Kim must be $430 + $320. Let me calculate that.

430 + 320. Hmm, 400 + 320 is 760, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 430 is 430, so 430 + 320 is 750? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 430 + 320 is 750. Wait, that seems right. 430 + 320 is 750. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Kim raises $750.

Then, Sarah: She raises $300. That's given.

Maryam: She raises $400 more than Sarah. So, Sarah is $300, so Maryam is 300 + 400. Let me compute that.

300 + 400 is 700. So, Maryam raises $700.

So, now I have all four amounts:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Now, to find the total amount raised, I need to add all these together.

Let me write them down:

430 (Alexandra) + 750 (Kim) + 300 (Sarah) + 700 (Maryam)

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them step by step.

First, add Alexandra and Kim: 430 + 750.

430 + 750: 400 + 700 is 1100, and 30 + 50 is 80, so total is 1180.

So, 430 + 750 = 1180.

Next, add Sarah: 300. So, 1180 + 300.

1180 + 300 is 1480.

Then, add Maryam: 700. So, 1480 + 700.

1480 + 700: 1400 + 700 is 2100, and 80 remains, so 2180.

Wait, that seems right. 1480 + 700 is 2180.

So, the total amount raised is $2180.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Alexandra: $430. Correct.

Kim: $430 + $320. Let me verify that. 430 + 320: 400 + 300 is 730, but, that seems right. 430 + 320 is 750? Wait, that seems right. 430 + 320: 400 + 320 is 760, and 30 is 30, so 760 + 30 is 750. Wait, that seems right. So, 430 + 3
