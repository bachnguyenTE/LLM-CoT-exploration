Q: 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?

Okay, so I have this problem about cheerleaders building a human pyramid, and I need to figure out how tall the pyramid is in feet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th is 60 inches tall. So, in total, there are 10 cheerleaders, with 9 being 64 inches and 1 being 60 inches. That means the heights are mostly around 64 inches, but, that seems right. So, the pyramid is built with these cheerleaders, and I need to figure out the total height of the pyramid.

The pyramid structure is given as follows: starting from the bottom, there are 4 girls. Then, on top of those 4, there are 3 girls. Then, on top of those 3, there are 2 girls, and the very top is just 1 girl. So, the pyramid has 4 levels, with the number of cheerleaders decreasing by one each level until the top.

Now, the question is asking for the total height of the human pyramid in feet. So, I think I need to calculate the total height of all the cheerleaders in the pyramid and then convert that from inches to feet.

Let me write down the number of cheerleaders at each level:

- Bottom level: 4 cheerleaders
- Next level: 3 cheerleaders
- Next level: 2 cheerleaders
- Top level: 1 cheerleader

So, the total number of cheerleaders in the pyramid is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. That makes sense because the problem mentions 10 cheerleaders.

Now, each cheerleader's height is given: 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and 1 is 60 inches tall. So, I need to figure out how many cheerleaders are 64 inches and how many are 60 inches.

Since 9 are 64 inches and 1 is 60 inches, that means the total height of the pyramid will be the sum of all these individual heights.

So, the total height in inches would be:

(9 cheerleaders * 64 inches) + (1 cheerleader * 60 inches)

Let me compute that:

First, 9 * 64. Let me do 9*60=540 and 9*4=36, so 540 + 36 = 576 inches.

Then, 1 * 60 = 60 inches.

So, total height is 576 + 60 = 636 inches.

Now, the question is asking for the height in feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I need to convert 636 inches to feet.

To convert inches to feet, I can divide the total inches by 12.

So, 636 divided by 12.

Let me compute that: 636 / 12.

Well, 12*50=600, so 636 - 600=36, which is 12*3, so 50 + 3=53.

So, 636 inches is 53 feet.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 9 cheerleaders at 64 inches: 9*64=576 inches.

1 cheerleader at 60 inches: 60 inches.

Total inches: 576 + 60=636 inches.

Convert to feet: 636 /12=53 feet.

Yes, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total height of the pyramid is 53 feet.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 9 cheerleaders at 64 inches, which is 576 inches, plus 1 at 60 inches, which is 60 inches, so total 636 inches, which is 53 feet.

So, the answer is 53 feet.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes.

Wait, that seems right. So, 9 cheerleaders at 64 inches, which is 576 inches, plus 1 at 60 inches, which is 60 inches, so total 636 inches, which is 53 feet.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

**Final Answer**
The height of the human pyramid is \boxed{53} feet.
