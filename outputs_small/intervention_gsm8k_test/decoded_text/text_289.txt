Q: A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars traveling in fast and slow lanes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a car in the fast lane is going at 60 miles per hour. Then, there's another car in the slow lane that's going at half that speed. So, the slow car must be going 30 miles per hour because half of 60 is 30. That makes sense.

Now, the fast lane car travels a total of 480 miles. I need to find out how long it took for the slow lane car to cover the same distance. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to use the formula for distance, which is distance equals speed multiplied by time. The formula is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

I can rearrange this formula to solve for time because I know the distance and the speed. The formula for time would be:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Alright, so for the fast lane car, I can calculate the time it took to travel 480 miles. Let me plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} \]

Let me do that division. 60 goes into 480 how many times? Well, 60 times 8 is 480, so that's 8 hours. So, the fast lane car took 8 hours to go 480 miles.

Now, I need to find out how long the slow lane car took to cover the same distance. Since the distance is the same, 480 miles, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the slow car is going slower, so it should take longer to cover the same distance. So, I need to calculate the time for the slow car.

The slow car is going at 30 mph. So, using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} \]

Let me compute that. 30 goes into 480 how many times? Well, 30 times 16 is 480, right? Because 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 6 is 180, so 300 plus 180 is 480. So, 16 hours. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the slow car took 16 hours to cover the same 480 miles. So, the time is longer because it's going slower.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fast car, 60 mph times 8 hours is 480 miles. That's correct. For the slow car, 30 mph times 16 hours is 480 miles. That also checks out. So, the time for the slow car is indeed 16 hours.

I think that's it. So, the answer should be 16 hours.

**Final Answer**
The slow lane car took \boxed{16} hours to cover the same distance.

The fast lane car is traveling at 60 miles per hour and covers a distance of 480 miles. To find the time it took, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the fast lane car:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The slow lane car is traveling at half the speed of the fast lane car, which is 30 miles per hour. To find the time it took to cover the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the slow lane car took \boxed{16} hours to cover the same distance.
