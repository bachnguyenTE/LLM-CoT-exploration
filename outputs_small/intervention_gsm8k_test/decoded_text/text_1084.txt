Q: If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them. They want to split it such that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. I need to figure out how much is left over for Sam. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me try to visualize the situation. There's a fence between Sam and Harry, and they have 100 feet of it. They want to divide this fence so that Harry gets more than Sam. Specifically, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. So, I guess I need to set up some equations to represent this.

Let me denote the length of the fence that Sam gets as S. Then, since Harry gets 60 feet more, his length would be S + 60. Together, the total fence is 100 feet, so I can write the equation:

S + (S + 60) = 100

Let me write that down:

S + S + 60 = 100

Combining like terms, that's:

2S + 60 = 100

Now, I need to solve for S. So, I'll subtract 60 from both sides:

2S = 100 - 60

Which is:

2S = 40

Then, divide both sides by 2:

S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. Then, Harry gets S +60, which is 20 +60 =82 feet.

Let me check if that adds up to 100 feet:

20 +82 =102

Wait, that seems right. 20 +82 is 102, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
