Q: A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the cost of almonds and walnuts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a pound of almonds costs $10, and a pound of walnuts costs $15. I need to find out how much more it costs to buy a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to another mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. 

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for each mixture and then find the difference between them. That makes sense. Let me write that down.

For the first mixture: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Since almonds are $10 per pound, the cost for 1/2 pound would be 1/2 times $10. Similarly, walnuts are $15 per pound, so the cost for 1/3 pound would be 1/3 times $15. Then, I add those two amounts together to get the total cost for the first mixture.

Let me compute that. 

First, 1/2 pound of almonds: (1/2) * $10 = $5. 

Next, 1/3 pound of walnuts: (1/3) * $15. Hmm, 15 divided by 3 is 5, so that's $5.

So, the total cost for the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10. 

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second mixture: 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. Again, I'll calculate each part separately.

Starting with almonds: 1/5 pound at $10 per pound. So, (1/5) * $10. Let me compute that. 10 divided by 5 is 2, so that's $2.

Then, walnuts: 1/3 pound at $15 per pound. So, (1/3) * $15. 15 divided by 3 is 5, so that's $5.

Adding those together, the total cost for the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7.

Alright, so now I have the total costs for each mixture: $10 for the first mixture and $7 for the second. The question is asking how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second. So, I need to subtract the second total from the first total.

That would be $10 - $7 = $3.

Wait, that seems right. So, the first mixture is $3 more expensive than the second one. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First mixture:
- Almonds: 1/2 pound * $10 = $5
- Walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15 = $5
Total: $5 + $5 = $10. That looks correct.

Second mixture:
- Almonds: 1/5 pound * $10 = $2
- Walnuts: 1/3 pound * $15 = $5
Total: $2 + $5 = $7. That also looks correct.

Difference: $10 - $7 = $3. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the answer should be $3.

**Final Answer**
The first mixture costs \boxed{3} dollars more than the second mixture.

To determine how much more it costs to buy a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the total cost for each mixture and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost for 1/2 pound of almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost for 1/3 pound of walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Total cost for the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost for 1/5 pound of almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost for 1/3 pound of walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Total cost for the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

The difference in cost between the two mixtures is:
- \(10 -
