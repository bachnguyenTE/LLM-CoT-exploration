Q: The vending machines sell chips for 40 cents and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. How many candy bars did he buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about George buying chips and candy bars from a vending machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that chips cost 40 cents and candy bars cost 75 cents. George spent a total of $5 and ended up with 1% of his money left. He bought 3 bags of chips. I need to find out how many candy bars he bought.

Alright, let's break this down. George spent $5, and he had 1% of his money left. So, that means he spent 99% of his money because 100% - 1% = 99%. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if he spent 99% of $5, that would be 0.99 * 5. Let me calculate that. 0.99 times 5 is... 4.95. So, he spent $4.95 in total.

He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is 3 * 0.40. Let me compute that. 0.40 times 3 is 1.20. So, he spent $1.20 on chips.

Now, subtracting that from the total he spent, which is $4.95, should give me the amount he spent on candy bars. So, 4.95 - 1.20 is... 3.75. So, he spent $3.75 on candy bars.

Now, each candy bar is 75 cents, so to find out how many he bought, I need to divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the price per candy bar. So, 3.75 divided by 0.75. Let me do that division.

3.75 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 goes into 3.75 exactly 5 times because 0.75 * 5 = 3.75. So, he bought 5 candy bars.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total money: $5. He spent 99%, which is $4.95. He bought 3 chips at $0.40 each, which is $1.20. So, $4.95 - $1.20 is $3.75. Divided by $0.75 per candy bar is 5. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, George bought 5 candy bars.

**Final Answer**
George bought \boxed{5} candy bars.

George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his money. 

First, we calculate 99% of $5:
\[
0.99 \times 5 = 4.95
\]
So, George spent $4.95 in total.

He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents. The total cost for the chips is:
\[
3 \times 0.40 = 1.20
\]

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives the amount spent on candy bars:
\[
4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75
\]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[
\frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5
\]

Thus, George bought \boxed{5} candy bars.
