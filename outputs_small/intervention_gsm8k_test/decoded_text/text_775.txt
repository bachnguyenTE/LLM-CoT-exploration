Q: Henry needs to assemble some toys, specifically 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to assemble all the toys he will need 4 wheels for each car and 2 wheels for each motorcycle. How many wheels will be left if he has a box with 650 wheels in it?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of wheels required to assemble all the toys. Henry needs 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Each car requires 4 wheels, so the total wheels for the cars are 57 multiplied by 4, which equals 228 wheels. Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels, so the total wheels for the motorcycles are 73 multiplied by 2, which equals 146 wheels. Adding these together, the total wheels needed are 228 plus 146, totaling 374 wheels.

Next, I'll subtract the total wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has in the box. Henry has 650 wheels, so subtracting 374 from 650 gives 280 wheels left.

To determine how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles all the toys, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:**
   
   \[
   \text{Wheels for cars} = 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels/car} = 228 \text{ wheels}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:**
   
   \[
   \text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of wheels needed for all toys:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total wheels needed} = 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of wheels left in the box:**
   
   \[
   \text{Wheels left} = 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{276}
\]
