Q: Alison qualified for a spot on the running team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Alison spent on buy her athletic gear. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, she bought a tank top for $10. That seems straightforward. So, tank top is $10.

Next, she bought a pair of running shorts. The problem says it cost $5 more than the top. Since the top was $10, the shorts must be $10 + $5 = $15. So, running shorts are $15.

Then, she bought a pair of tennis shoes. They were originally $48, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the original price is $48, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the original price is $48, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the original price is $48, but, that seems right. So, the sale is half price. So, half of $48 is $24. So, the tennis shoes cost $24.

Now, she also bought athletic socks. The problem says she had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks. So, the package is $8, but, that seems right. So, the coupon is $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.

So, let me list all the items:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Now, I need to add all these up to find the total amount she spent.

Let me add the tank top and running shorts first: $10 + $15 = $225.

Then, add the tennis shoes: $25 + $24 = $49.

Wait, that seems right. 25 plus 24 is 49.

Then, add the athletic socks: $49 + $6 = $55.

So, altogether, she spent $55 on her athletic gear.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step.

Tank top: $10. Correct.

Running shorts: $5 more than $10 is $15. Correct.

Tennis shoes: Half of $48 is $24. Correct.

Athletic socks: $8 package with a $2 coupon, so $6. Correct.

Adding them up: 10 + 15 is 25, 25 + 24 is 49, 49 +6 is 55. So, yes, $55.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount she spent is $55.

I think that's it. So, the answer is $55.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{55}

Alison bought several items for her athletic gear. Here is the breakdown of the costs:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15 (which is $5 more than the tank top)
- Tennis shoes: $24 (which is half of the original $48)
- Athletic socks: $6 (which is $8 - $2 coupon)

Adding these amounts together:

\[
10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55
\]

Thus, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is \(\boxed{55}\).
