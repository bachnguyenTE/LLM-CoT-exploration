Q: The marching band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?

Okay, so I have this problem about the marching band ordering new uniforms, and I need to figure out how much each uniform costs in total. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants. I need to find the total cost of each uniform, which means I have to add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. 

Let me list out what each item costs:

1. **Hat:** The problem says the hat costs $25. That seems straightforward.

2. **Jacket:** The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Hmm, okay, so if the hat is $25, then the jacket should be 3 times that. Let me write that down: Jacket cost = 3 * Hat cost. So, that would be 3 * $25. Let me calculate that. 3 times 25 is 15, so the jacket costs $75? Wait, that seems right. 3 times 25 is 75, yeah.

3. **Pants:** The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the average of the hat and jacket. Since the hat is $25 and the jacket is $75, the average would be (25 + 75) divided by 2. Let me compute that. 25 plus 75 is 100, and 100 divided by 2 is 55. So, the pants cost $55.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me recap:

- Hat: $25
- Jacket: $75
- Pants: $55

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, I need to add these three amounts together. So, total cost = hat + jacket + pants. Let me compute that.

First, add the hat and jacket: 25 + 75. That's 100. Then, add the pants: 100 + 55. That's 155. So, the total cost is $155.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the hat: $25. That's given. The jacket is three times that, so 3 * 25 is indeed 75. Then, the pants are the average of the hat and jacket. So, (25 + 75)/2. 25 +75 is 100, divided by 2 is 55. So, pants are $55.

Adding them up: 25 +75 is 100, plus 55 is 155. So, total cost is $155. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using variables or equations.

Let me denote:

- Let H be the cost of the hat. H = $25.

- The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so J = 3H. So, J = 3 * 25 = 75.

- The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket. So, P = (H + J)/2. Plugging in the numbers, P = (25 + 75)/2 = 100/2 = 50.

So, pants are $50. Then, total cost is H + J + P = 25 +75 +50. Let me add them again: 25 +75 is 100, plus 50 is 155. So, same result.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost is $155.

Is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.

Each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants. So, three items. The hat is $25, jacket is three times the hat, so 3*25=75. Pants are the average of the hat and jacket, so (25 +75)/2=50. So, total is 25+75+50=150. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $155.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. The problem says the pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. So, that's (25 +75)/2=50. So, pants are 50. So, total is 25+75+50=150
