Q: Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.  She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it.  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much did she pay?

Okay, so Janet bought a brooch for her daughter. Let me try to figure out how much she paid in total. Hmm, the problem says she paid $500 for the material to make it. Then, she spent another $800 on the jeweler to construct it. After that, she had to pay 10% for insurance. I need to add all these amounts together to find the total cost.

First, let me write down each cost separately to make it clear. The material cost is $500, and the jeweler's cost is $800. Then, the insurance is 10% of the total of those two. Wait, that seems right. So, I should calculate the total cost before insurance first, and then add the insurance to it.

So, adding the material and the jeweler costs: $500 + $800. Let me do that math. 500 plus 800. 500 plus 800 is... 500 + 800. Hmm, 500 + 800. 500 + 800 is 1350? Wait, that seems right. 500 + 800 is 1300, plus 50 is 1350. So, the total cost before insurance is $1350.

Now, she has to pay 10% for insurance. So, 10% of $1350. To calculate 10%, I can multiply 1350 by 0.10. Let me do that. 1350 * 0.10. 100% of 1350 is 1350, so 10% is 135. So, the insurance cost is $135.

Now, to find the total amount she paid, I need to add the insurance to the total cost before insurance. So, $1350 (which is the total before insurance) plus $135 for insurance. Let me add those together. 1350 + 135. 1350 + 100 is 1450, and then +35 is 1485. So, the total amount she paid is $1485.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Material: $500, jeweler: $800. Total before insurance: 500 + 800 = 1300. Wait, that seems right. 500 + 800 is 1300. Then, 10% of 1300 is 130. So, 1300 + 130 is 1430. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
