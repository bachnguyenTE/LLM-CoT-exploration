Q: James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.  He spends $2640 on shoes each year.  How much does he pay on average for each pair of shoes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. He spends $2640 on shoes each year. The question is asking how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. So, in a year, which is 12 months, he buys 2 pairs each month. That means the total number of pairs he buys in a year is 2 multiplied by 12. Let me write that down:

Total pairs per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year.

Wait, that seems right. So, he buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year. But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2 pairs each month, 12 months: 2*12=24. Yep, that's correct.

Now, he spends $2640 on shoes each year. So, he spends $2640 for 24 pairs of shoes. The question is asking for the average cost per pair. So, to find the average cost per pair, I need to divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs.

So, average cost per pair = total annual spending / total number of pairs.

Plugging in the numbers:

Average cost per pair = $2640 / 24 pairs.

Hmm, let me compute that. 2640 divided by 24. Let me do this division step by step.

First, 24 goes into 264 how many times? 24*10=240, which is less than 264. 24*110=2640, which is more than 264. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
