Q: Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Joe's Halloween candy bag. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Joe has a bag with 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. It also mentions that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. The question is asking how much the entire bag of candy weighs in grams.

Alright, let's break this down. I need to find the total weight of all the candies in the bag. That means I need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.

Starting with the chocolate bars. It says there are 25 chocolate bars, and each one weighs twice as much as a candied apple. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as a candied apple, but, that seems right. Hmm, actually, wait, that seems right. So, if each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple, but, that seems right. So, if I can find the weight of one candied apple, I can find the weight of one chocolate bar, which is given as 40 grams.

Wait, that seems right. So, each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple. So, if a chocolate bar is 40 grams, then each candied apple must be half of that, right? Because twice as much as a candied apple is 40 grams. So, if 2 times the weight of a candied apple is 40 grams, then the weight of one candied apple is 40 divided by 2, which is 20 grams. So, each candied apple is 20 grams.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

Weight of one chocolate bar = 40 grams.

Since each chocolate bar is twice as heavy as each candied apple, then:

Weight of one candied apple = (Weight of one chocolate bar) / 2 = 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

Okay, so each candied apple is 20 grams. Got that.

Now, moving on to the number of each candy. There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.

So, to find the total weight of the chocolate bars, I need to multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar.

Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars * Weight per chocolate bar = 25 * 40 grams.

Let me calculate that. 25 times 40. Hmm, 25 times 40. Well, 25 times 4 is 100, so 25 times 40 is 1000 grams. So, the chocolate bars weigh 1000 grams in total.

Now, moving on to the candied apples. Similarly, I need to multiply the number of candied apples by the weight of each candied apple.

Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples * Weight per candied apple = 80 * 20 grams.

Calculating that. 80 times 20. Hmm, 80 times 20. Let me think. 80 times 20 is the same as 80 times 2 times 10, which is 160 times 10, which is 1600 grams. So, the candied apples weigh 1600 grams in total.

Now, to find the total weight of the entire bag, I need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together.

Total weight of the bag = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples = 1000 grams + 1600 grams.

Adding those together. 1000 plus 1600 is 2600, and then plus 0 is still 2600. So, 1000 + 1600 is 2600. So, the total weight is 2600 grams.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, chocolate bars: 25 bars, each 40 grams. 25 times 40 is 1000. That seems correct.

Candied apples: 80 apples, each 20 grams. 80 times 20. Let me do that again. 80 times 20 is 1600. That's correct.

Adding 1000 and 1600: 1000 + 1600 is 2600. So, 26
