Q: Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias that geraniums. How many flowers does he plant total? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. Andy is planting two types of flowers: geraniums and petunias. The number of petunias he plants is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. So, if I know how many geraniums he has, I can find out how many petunias he has by subtracting 40 from that number.

The problem says he plants 90 geraniums. Wait, that seems right. So, 90 geraniums. Now, how many petunias? It's 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. So, if he has 90 geraniums, then the number of petunias is 90 minus 40. Let me write that down.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 minus 40. Let me do the subtraction. 90 minus 40 is... 50? Let me check: 90 minus 40. 9 minus 4 is 5, and 0 minus 0 is 0, so yes, 50. So, Andy plants 50 petunias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers he plants, I need to add the number of geraniums and petunias together. So, total flowers = number of geraniums + number of petunias.

Total flowers = 90 + 50

Wait, that seems right. 90 plus 50. 90 plus 50. Let me add them. 90 plus 50. 90 plus 50 is 140? Wait, that seems right. 90 plus 50 is 140. Hmm, let me verify. 90 plus 50: 90 plus 50 is 140. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Number of geraniums: 90
2. Number of petunias: 90 - 40 = 50
3. Total flowers: 90 + 50 = 140

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 plus 50 is 140. Yeah, that's correct.

I think that's it. So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

**Final Answer**
The total number of flowers Andy plants is \boxed{140}.

Andy plants 90 geraniums. The number of petunias he plants is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums. 

First, we calculate the number of petunias:
\[
\text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
\]

Next, we find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias together:
\[
\text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of flowers Andy plants is \boxed{140}.
