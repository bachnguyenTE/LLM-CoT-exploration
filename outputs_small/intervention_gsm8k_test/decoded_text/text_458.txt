Q: Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jennifer's and Brandon's dogs and the number of puppies with spots. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. That seems straightforward. So, for Jennifer's dog, the number of spotted puppies is 3 out of 8. I can write that as a fraction: 3/8. Maybe I can convert that to a percentage later on.

Then, Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So, similar idea here. 4 out of 12 puppies have spots. That fraction is 4/12. Hmm, I can simplify that, right? Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4. So, 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, that simplifies to 1/3. Okay, so Brandon's dog has 1/3 of its puppies with spots.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of all the puppies that have spots. So, I think I need to combine both dogs' spotted puppies and then find the total number of puppies, and then calculate the percentage.

Let me add up the spotted puppies first. Jennifer has 3, and Brandon has 4. So, 3 plus 4 is 7. So, there are 7 spotted puppies in total.

Now, how many puppies are there altogether? Jennifer's dog has 8, and Brandon's has 12. So, 8 plus 12 is 20. Wait, that seems right. 8 plus 12 is 20? Wait, that seems right. 8 plus 12 is 20? Wait, that seems right. 8 plus 12 is 20? Wait, that seems right. 8 plus 12 is 20. Yeah, 8 plus 12 is 20. So, there are 20 puppies in total.

So, out of 20 puppies, 7 have spots. So, the fraction is 7/20. I need to convert that to a percentage. To do that, I can divide 7 by 20 and then multiply by 100.

Let me do that. 7 divided by 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 7 zero times. So, 0. Then, 20 goes into 70 how many times? Hmm, 20 goes into 70 three times because 20 times 3 is 60. So, 3. Subtract 60 from 70, you get 10. Bring down the next 0, making it 100. 20 goes into 100 five times. So, 0.35. So, 7 divided by 20 is 0.35. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, so 0.35 times 100 is 35%. So, 35%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 7 divided by 20 is 0.35, which is 35%. So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding the fractions first. Jennifer's dog has 3/8, and Brandon's has 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3. So, 3/8 plus 1/3. To add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 8 and 3. The least common multiple of 8 and 3 is 24. So, converting both fractions to 24ths.

3/8 is equal to (3*3)/(8*3) which is 9/24. 1/3 is equal to (1*8)/(3*8) which is 8/24. So, adding 9/24 and 8/24 gives 17/24. So, 17/24 of the puppies have spots. Then, to convert that to a percentage, I can divide 17 by 24. Wait, that seems right. 17 divided by 24. Let me do that.

24 goes into 17 zero times. 24 goes into 170 how many times? 24 times 7 is 168. So, 7. Subtract 168 from 170, you get 2. Bring down a zero, making it 20. 24 goes into 20 zero times. Bring down another zero, making it 200. 24 goes into 20
