Okay, so I have this problem here about John inviting 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Hot dogs are sold in packs of 6, each pack costing $2. I need to figure out how much John needs to spend on hot dogs. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how many hot dogs John needs in total for the birthday party. He's inviting 20 people, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, I can calculate the total number of hot dogs needed by multiplying the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat. That would be 20 people multiplied by 2 hot dogs per person. Let me write that down:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.

So, John needs 40 hot dogs in total for the party.

But, that seems right. 20 times 2 is 40. Okay, so he needs 40 hot dogs.

Now, he already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, I need to subtract those from the total he needs. That means he doesn't need to buy all 40, he can use the 4 he already has. Let me write that:

40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs already have = 36 hot dogs needed.

Wait, that seems right. 40 minus 4 is 36. So, he needs 36 more hot dogs.

Now, the next part is figuring out how many packs of hot dogs he needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, I need to divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack. That would be:

36 hot dogs needed / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs.

So, he needs to buy 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so to find the total cost, I can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack. That would be:

6 packs * $2 per pack = $12.

Wait, that seems right. 6 times 2 is 12. So, the total cost is $12.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, 20 guests times 2 hot dogs each is 40. Then, subtract the 4 he already has, which gives 36. Wait, that seems right. 40 minus 4 is 36, not 36. Wait, that seems right. 40 minus 4 is 36. Wait, that seems right. 40 minus 4 is 36. So, 36 hot dogs needed.

Then, 36 divided by 6 is 6 packs. 6 times 6 is 36. So, that's correct.

Each pack is $2, so 6 packs times $2 is $12. So, the total cost is $12.

Wait, that seems right. So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $12.

But, that seems right. Let me just think again.

He needs 40 hot dogs. He has 4 left over, so he needs 36 more. Each pack is 6, so 36 divided by 6 is 6 packs. Each pack is $2, so 6 times 2 is 12. So, yes, $12.

I think that's correct. So, the answer is $12.

**Final Answer**
John needs to spend \boxed{12} dollars on hot dogs.

John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs already have} = 36 \text{ hot dogs needed} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, so the number of packs needed is:

\[ 36 \text{ hot dogs needed} / 6 \text{ hot dogs/pack} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times \$2 \text{ per pack} = \$12
