Q: 3 trees each had 7 blue birds in them. 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds. 1 final tree had 3 blue birds. How many blue birds were in the trees in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of blue birds in all the trees.

There are three trees, each containing 7 blue birds. So, 3 trees multiplied by 7 birds each equals 21 birds.

Next, there are two trees, each with 4 blue birds. This adds 2 trees multiplied by 4 birds each, totaling 8 birds.

Finally, the last tree has 3 blue birds.

Adding all these together: 21 birds + 8 birds + 3 birds equals 33 birds in total.

To find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Group of Trees:**
   - **Number of Trees:** 3
   - **Birds per Tree:** 7
   - **Total Birds:** \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) birds

2. **Second Group of Trees:**
   - **Number of Trees:** 2
   - **Birds per Tree:** 4
   - **Total Birds:** \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) birds

3. **Third Tree:**
   - **Birds:** 3

4. **Adding All Together:**
   - **Total Birds:** \( 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \) birds

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32}
