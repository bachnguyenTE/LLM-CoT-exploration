Q: Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.  Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.   Eva has saved $20.00.  How much money does Roy have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Roy, Anthony, and Eva saving money from chores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony. Hmm, okay. So, Roy's savings are higher than Anthony's. I need to figure out how much Roy has saved. 

Then, it says Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva. Eva has saved $20.00. So, Eva's savings are given, which is $20.00. That should help me find Anthony's savings first, right?

Let me write down what I know:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.

So, starting with Eva, since she has $20.00, and Anthony has $10.00 more than her. So, Anthony's savings would be Eva's savings plus $10.00. Let me calculate that.

Eva: $20.00  
Anthony: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Wait, that seems right. So, Anthony has $30.00. Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. So, I need to find 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to his amount.

First, let's find 40% of $30.00. To calculate 40% of $30, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 40% is 0.40. So, 0.40 multiplied by $30.00.

Let me do that multiplication: 0.40 * 30.00. Hmm, 0.4 * 30 is 12.00, so 0.4 * 30.00 is 12.00. So, 40% of $30.00 is $12.00.

Now, to find how much Roy has saved, I add that 40% to Anthony's savings. So, $30.00 + $12.000 = $32.000. Wait, that seems right. So, 40% of 30 is 12, so 30 + 12 is 32? Wait, that seems right.
