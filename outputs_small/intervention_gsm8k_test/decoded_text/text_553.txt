Q: Bill is trying to figure out how many water bottles he needs to buy for his party.  He started out with 2 cases of water which have 24 bottles each. He has 70 guests that will be arriving, and he wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. How many additional bottles of water will he need to buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has by multiplying the number of cases by the number of bottles per case.

2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.

Next, determine the total number of water bottles needed for all the guests by multiplying the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest.

70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.

Finally, subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed to find out how many additional bottles he needs to purchase.

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles available = 92 additional bottles needed.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of water bottles needed for all guests:**
   
   \[
   70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy:**
   
   \[
   140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles available} = 92 \text{ additional bottles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{92}
\]
