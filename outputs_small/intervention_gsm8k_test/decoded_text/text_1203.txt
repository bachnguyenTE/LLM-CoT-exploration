Q: Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mattison's house. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times as high as he is. The question is asking how high the roof is from the second floor's floor.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Mattison's height is 60 inches. His house is two-story, so that means it has two floors. The first thing I need to figure out is the total height of the house. It says the house is 7 times as high as Mattison. So, if Mattison is 60 inches, then the house's height would be 7 multiplied by 60 inches.

Let me write that down:

Height of house = 7 * Mattison's height
Height of house = 7 * 60 inches

Calculating that, 7 times 60. Let me do the multiplication. 7 times 60. Well, 7 times 60 is 420. So, the house is 420 inches tall.

Wait, that seems right. 7 times 60 is 420. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the problem also mentions the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times as high as Mattison's height. So, the first floor's ceiling is 3 times Mattison's height.

Let me write that down:

Height of first floor ceiling = 3 * Mattison's height
Height of first floor ceiling = 3 * 60 inches

Calculating that, 3 times 60. 3*60 is 186 inches. So, the ceiling on the first floor is 186 inches high.

Wait, that seems right. 3 times Mattison's height is 186 inches.

So, now, the house is two-story, so the total height of the house is the height of the first floor plus the height from the first floor to the roof. But, that seems right. So, the total height of the house is the first floor's ceiling plus the roof's height.

But, that seems right. So, if the total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor's ceiling is 186 inches, then the roof's height from the first floor's ceiling to the roof would be 420 - 186.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that:

Roof height from first floor ceiling = Total house height - First floor ceiling height
Roof height from first floor ceiling = 420 - 186

Calculating that, 420 minus 186. Let me do that subtraction. 420 minus 100 is 320, then minus 86 more. 320 minus 86 is 234. So, 420 - 186 is 234 inches.

Wait, that seems right. 186 plus 234 is 420, so that checks out.

But, that seems right. So, the roof is 234 inches above the first floor's ceiling.

But, that seems right. So, the question is asking how high the roof is from the second floor's floor. So, the second floor's floor is the same as the first floor's ceiling, right? So, the roof is 234 inches above the second floor's floor.

Wait, that seems right. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 234 inches.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 234 inches.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Mattison's height: 60 inches.

2. House height: 7 times Mattison's height. So, 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

3. First floor ceiling height: 3 times Mattison's height. So, 3 * 60 = 186 inches.

4. Roof height from first floor ceiling: total house height minus first floor ceiling height. So, 420 - 186 = 234 inches.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 234 inches.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 234 inches.

So, I think that's the
