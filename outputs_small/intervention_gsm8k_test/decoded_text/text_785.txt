Q: Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Carrie has ten twenties and 140 quarters. She wants to use all the quarters and three-fifths of the twenties for lunch. I need to figure out how much money she spent in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much the quarters are worth. Each quarter is worth $0.25, right? So, if she has 140 quarters, I can multiply 140 by $0.25 to get the total amount she spent on the quarters. Let me write that out:

140 quarters * $0.25 per quarter.

Hmm, 140 times 0.25. I know that 100 quarters make $25, so 140 quarters would be 140 quarters plus 4 quarters. Wait, that seems right. So, 140 quarters is 140 * 0.25. Let me calculate that.

140 * 0.25. Well, 140 divided by 4 is 35.5, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, 0.25 is a quarter, so 140 quarters is 140 * 0.25. Let me compute 140 * 0.25.

140 * 0.25 is the same as 140 divided by 4, which is 35.25. Wait, that seems right. Because 4 quarters make a dollar, so 140 quarters is 35 dollars and 05 cents. So, $35.25. Okay, so she spent $35.25 on the quarters.

Now, onto the twenties. She spent three-fifths of the twenties. She has ten twenties, so three-fifths of 10 twenties. Let me calculate that.

Three-fifths of 10 is (3/5)*10. 10 divided by 5 is 2, so 2 times 3 is 6. So, she spent 6 twenties. Each twenty is $20, so 6 twenties would be 6 * $20.

6 * 20 is 120. So, she spent $120 on the twenties.

Now, to find the total amount she spent, I need to add the money spent on quarters and twenties together. So, $35.25 plus $120.

Let me add those. $35.25 plus $20 is $55.25. Wait, that seems right. 35.25 + 20 is 55.25. So, $55.25 in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, quarters: 140 * 0.25. 140 * 0.25 is 35, and 4 * 0.25 is 1, so 35 + 1 is 36. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
