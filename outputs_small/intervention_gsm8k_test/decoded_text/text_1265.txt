Q: Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?

Okay, so Tim wants to make lemonade for a pool party. He needs to figure out how many lemons he'll need. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the recipe says for a gallon of lemonade, he needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. He's planning to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Hmm, so if each gallon requires 1 cup, then 4 gallons would require 4 cups of lemon juice. That makes sense.

Now, he found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. So, if he needs 4 cups, how many lemons is that? Let me calculate that. If 6 lemons make 1 cup, then 4 cups would be 4 times 6 lemons. So, 4 * 6 = 24 lemons. Okay, so Tim needs 24 lemons for the 4 gallons.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 6 lemons per cup, 4 cups needed, so 24 lemons total.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
