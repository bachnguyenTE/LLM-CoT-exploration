Q: How many girls are in the school if 40% of a school population is made up of 240 boys?

Okay, so I have this problem here: "How many girls are in the school if 40% of a school population is made up of 240 boys?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I know that percentages can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, 40% of the school population are boys, and there are 240 boys. I need to find out the total number of students in the school, and then subtract the number of boys to get the number of girls. That makes sense because if 40% are boys, the rest must be girls.

Let me write this down. If 40% corresponds to 240 boys, then 100% would correspond to the total number of students. So, I can set up a proportion or maybe use fractions to solve for the total. 

I remember that percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100. So, 40% is 0.4 in decimal form. If I let the total number of students be T, then 0.4 * T = 240. That seems like a good equation to solve for T.

So, let me write that equation: 0.4 * T = 240. To find T, I need to divide both sides by 0.4. So, T = 240 / 0.4. Hmm, let me compute that. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 240 divided by 0.4. Let me do this division. 240 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.4 goes into 240 how many times? Maybe I can convert 0.4 into a fraction to make it easier. 0.4 is the same as 2/5. So, dividing by 2/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/2. So, 240 * (5/2). 

Let me compute that. 240 divided by 2 is 120, and 120 multiplied by 5 is 600. So, T is 600. So, the total number of students is 600. 

Now, since 40% are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. So, I need to find 60% of 600. Let me compute that. 60% is 0.6 in decimal form. So, 0.6 * 600. 

Calculating that, 0.6 times 600. Well, 0.6 is the same as 6/10, so 6/10 of 600 is (6*600)/10. 6*600 is 3600, divided by 10 is 360. So, the number of girls is 360.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. 

First, 40% are boys, so 40% of T is 240. So, T = 240 / 0.4 = 600. Then, 60% of 600 is 360. So, girls are 360. That seems consistent. 

Alternatively, I can think of it as 40% boys, so 60% girls. So, 60% of 600 is 360. Yeah, that's the same answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios. If 40% are boys, then the ratio of boys to girls is 40:60, which simplifies to 2:3. So, for every 2 boys, there are 3 girls. 

So, if there are 240 boys, how many girls are there? Let me set up a proportion. 

2 boys correspond to 3 girls, so 240 boys correspond to x girls. So, 2/3 = 240/x. Cross-multiplying, 2x = 3*240. So, 2x = 720. Therefore, x = 360. So, that's the same answer. 

So, whether I use the total number of students, or set up a ratio, I get 360 girls. So, that seems solid. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions. 

If 40% are boys, then 40/100 of the school are boys, so 40/100. So, 40/
