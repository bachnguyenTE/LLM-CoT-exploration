Q: Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?

Okay, so Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner and ordered soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. I need to figure out how much she paid in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says she ordered a bagel that cost $4. That's straightforward. So, bagel = $4.

Next, the soup cost 25% more than the bagel. Hmm, 25% more means I need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and then add that to the bagel's price. Let me write that out:

Bagel = $4

Soup = Bagel + (25% of Bagel)

So, 25% of $4 is... let me calculate that. 25% is the same as 0.25 in decimal, right? So, 0.25 * 4 = $1. So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel. Therefore, the total cost for soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

Wait, that seems right. 25% of 4 is 1, so adding that to 4 gives 5. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the cake is only half the price of the bagel. The bagel is $4, so half of that would be $2. So, cake = $2.

Alright, so now I have the costs for each item:

- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

To find the total amount Aleksandra paid, I need to add up these three amounts.

Let me add them step by step:

First, add the bagel and the soup: $4 + $5 = $9.

Then, add the cake to that total: $9 + $2 = $11.

Wait, that seems right. So, $4 for the bagel, $5 for the soup, and $2 for the cake. Adding them together: 4 + 5 is 9, and 9 + 2 is 11. So, the total is $11.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Bagel is $4. 25% more than that is 1, so soup is $5. Cake is half of $4, which is $2. So, 4 + 5 + 2 is indeed 11. So, $11 total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount Aleksandra paid is $11.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 25% more than $4 is $5, which is correct. Half of $4 is $2, correct. So, 4 + 5 + 2 is 11. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think the answer is $11.

**Final Answer**
The total amount Aleksandra paid for her dinner is \boxed{11}.
</think>

Aleksandra ordered a bagel, soup, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4. The soup cost 25% more than the bagel, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Soup} = \text{Bagel} + (0.25 \times \text{Bagel}) = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

The cake cost half of the price of the bagel:

\[
\text{Cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Adding the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake together:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Bagel} + \text{Soup} + \text{Cake} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

The total amount Aleksandra paid for her dinner is \boxed{11}.
