Q: Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.  He passes 14 out to his friends.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.  How many lollipops does Oscar have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how many lollipops Oscar has. Hmm, he starts with 24. Then he eats 2 on his way to school. So, I guess that's subtracting 2 from 24. Let me write that down: 24 - 2 = 22. So, he has 22 left after eating at school.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends. So, that means he gives away 14 lollipops. Wait, that seems right. So, subtracting 14 from 22. Let me calculate that: 22 -14 = 8. So, he has 8 left after giving to his friends.

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends. Hmm, he gave 14 to his friends, so twice that would be 28. So, he buys 28 more. So, adding that to his current amount. He had 8, so 8 +28 = 36. So, he now has 36 lollipops.

Wait, that seems right. So, 8 plus 28 is 36. Okay, moving on.

He eats 3 more that night. So, subtracting 3 from 36. 36 -3 = 3. So, he has 3 left after that.

Then, he eats 2 more in the morning. So, subtracting another 2. 3 -2 =1. So, he has 1 lollipops left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Start: 24

Eats 2: 24 -2 =22

Gives to friends: 22 -14=8

Buys twice as much as friends: 8 +28=16

Eats 3:16 -3=3

Eats 2:3 -2=1

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final number is 1.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if I missed anything. He starts with 24, eats 2, gives 14, buys 28, eats 3, eats 2. So, 24-2=22, 22-14=8, 8+28=36, 36-3=33, 33-2=1. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the answer is 1 lollipops.

**Final Answer**
Oscar has \boxed{1} lollipops.
</think>

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 22. He then gives 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 8. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 28, bringing his total to 36. He eats 3 more lollipops that night, leaving him with 3. Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, leaving him with 1.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Start:} & \quad 24 \\
\text{Eats 2:} & \quad 24 - 2 = 22 \\
\text{Gives 14 to friends:} & \quad 22 - 14 = 8 \\
\text{Buys 28:} & \quad 8 + 28 = 36 \\
\text{Eats 3:} & \quad 36 - 3 = 3 \\
\text{Eats 2:} & \quad 3 - 2 = 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Oscar has \boxed{1} lollipops.
