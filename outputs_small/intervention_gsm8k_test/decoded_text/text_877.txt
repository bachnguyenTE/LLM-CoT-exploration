Q: To make a profit of $2000, Isaias has to sell the chickens he planned to take to the market from his farm at $50 per chicken. If Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them, for how much money did Isaias buy the chicken he took to the market for sale?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Isaias and his chickens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling his chickens at the market. He has 300 chickens on his farm and plans to sell 3/5 of them. Each chicken is sold at $50 per chicken. The question is asking how much money Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. He wants a profit of $2000. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. In this case, the total cost would be the amount he spent buying the chickens, and the total revenue is the money he gets from selling them.

He has 300 chickens, and he's planning to sell 3/5 of them. So, first, I need to find out how many chickens he's actually going to sell. Let me calculate that.

3/5 of 300 chickens. So, 300 divided by 5 is 66, and then multiplied by 3 is 198. So, he's selling 198 chickens.

Each chicken is sold at $50. So, the total revenue he expects is 198 chickens times $55 per chicken. Let me compute that.

198 times 55. Hmm, 200 times 55 is 11,000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 198 is 200 minus 2, so 200 times 55 is 11,000, and 2 times 55 is 110, so 11,000 minus 110 is 11,000 - 110 is 10,890. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
