Q: To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms, 4 liters will need 4 times that, which is 20 kilograms.

Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the kilograms of oranges by the cost per kilogram. 20 kilograms multiplied by $3 per kilogram equals $66.

Therefore, Sam would need to spend $66 to make 4 liters of juice.

To determine how much money Sam would need to make 4 liters of juice, follow these steps:

1. **Find the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters:**
   
   - **1 liter of juice requires:** 5 kilograms of oranges.
   
   - **4 liters of juice requires:** 
     
     \[
     4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the oranges:**
   
   - **Cost per kilogram of oranges:** \$3.
   
   - **Total cost for 20 kg of oranges:**
     
     \[
     20 \text{ kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$66
     \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{66}
   \]
