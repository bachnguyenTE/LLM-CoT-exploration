Q: Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Carol spends time writing, recording, and editing a song. I need to figure out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Carol spends 4 hours writing the song. That's straightforward. Then, it mentions she spends half that much time recording it. So, if she spent 4 hours writing, half of that would be... let me calculate that. Half of 4 is 2, so she spends 2 hours recording. Got that.

Next, she spends 90 minutes editing. Hmm, the units here are different from the others—she's working in hours for writing and recording, but, that seems right. So, I need to make sure all the time spent is in the same unit to calculate the percentage. Since the writing and recording times are in hours, I should convert the editing time into hours as well.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, right? Wait, that seems right. 60 minutes is 1 hour and 6 minutes, so 1.1 hours. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 60 minutes is 60/60 hours, which is 1 hour. So, 90 minutes is 90/60 hours. Let me compute that. 90 divided by 60. Hmm, 60 goes into 90 once with a remainder of 30. So, 1 and 30/60, which simplifies to 1 and 1/2 hours. So, 1.5 hours. So, she spends 1.5 hours editing.

Wait, that seems right. 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. So, 1.5 hours editing.

So, now, let me summarize:

- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
-Editing: 1.5 hours

Now, I need to find the total work time. So, I'll add all these up.

Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5

Let me compute that. 4 + 2 is 6, and 6 + 1.5 is 7.5 hours. So, total work time is 7.5 hours.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing. So, editing time is 1.5 hours, and total time is 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage, I can use the formula:

Percentage = (Editing Time / Total Time) * 100

So, plugging in the numbers:

Percentage = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

Let me compute 1.5 divided by 7.5. Hmm, 1.5 divided by 7.5. Well, 7.5 divided by 1.5 is 5, so 1.5 divided by 7.5 is 1/5, which is 0.2.

So, 0.2 multiplied by 100 is 20. So, 20%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, writing: 4 hours. Correct.

Recording: half of 4 is 2 hours. Correct.

Editing: 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. Correct.

Total time: 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. Correct.

Editing time as a percentage: (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%. Correct.

So, I think that's the answer. 20%.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, I can convert all the times to minutes to make it easier.

Writing: 4 hours is 240 minutes (since 4*60=240). Recording: 2 hours is 120 minutes. Editing: 90 minutes.

Total time: 240 + 120 +90.

Let me compute that: 240 + 120 is 366, and 366 +90 is 456 minutes.

Editing time is 90 minutes.

So, percentage is (90 / 456) *100.

Wait, that seems right. 90 divided by 456.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute 90 divided by 456.

Hmm, 90 divided by 456. Let me see, 456 divided by 9 is 50.666... So, 90 is 9 times 10, so 456 divided
