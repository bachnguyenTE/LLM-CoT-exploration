Q: It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. If a packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30, how much money did she use to buy the seeds?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 200 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, I'll multiply 20 by 40 to find the total cost for the tomato seeds.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, each costing $30. I'll multiply 80 by 30 to find the total cost for the celery seeds.

Finally, I'll add the total costs of both the tomato and celery seeds to find the overall amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds.

**Solution:**

Mrs. Rylan bought two types of vegetable seeds: tomato and celery. We need to calculate the total cost for each type and then sum them up.

1. **Tomato Seeds:**
   - Number of packets: 200
   - Cost per packet: \$40
   - **Total cost for tomato seeds:**  
     \[
     220 \text{ packets} \times \$40/\text{packet} = \$880
     \]

2. **Celery Seeds:**
   - Number of packets: 80
   - Cost per packet: \$30
   - **Total cost for celery seeds:**  
     \[
     80 \text{ packets} \times \$30/\text{packet} = \$240
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - **Total cost for all seeds:**  
     \[
     \$880 + \$240 = \$1120
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1120}
\]
