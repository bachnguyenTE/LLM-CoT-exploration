Q: Brett is 14 years old. In four years his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now. How old is Angela right now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Brett is 14 years old. In four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now. How old is Angela right now? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Brett is currently 14. In four years, which means in 14 + 4 = 18 years from now, Angela's age will be three times what Brett's age is now. So, right now, Brett is 14, and in four years, he'll be 18. At that time, Angela will be 3 times 14, which is 42. So, if I can figure out how old Angela is now, I can set up an equation.

Let me denote Angela's current age as A. So, in four years, her age will be A + 4. According to the problem, that will be equal to three times Brett's current age. So, A + 4 = 3 * 14. Let me compute that: 3 * 14 is 42. So, A + 4 = 42. To find A, I subtract 4 from both sides: A = 42 - 4, which is 38. So, Angela is 38 years old right now.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Brett is 14 now, in four years he'll be 18. If Angela is 38 now, in four years she'll be 42. And 42 is indeed three times 14. So, that checks out.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's see, in four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age. So, if I let A be Angela's current age, then in four years, she'll be A + 4. And that equals 3 * 14, which is 42. So, A + 4 = 42, so A = 38. Yep, same answer.

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using algebraic equations. Let me set up the equation:

Let A = Angela's current age.

In four years, Angela's age will be A + 4.

According to the problem, A + 4 = 3 * Brett's current age.

Brett's current age is 14, so 3 *14 = 42.

So, A +4 =42.

Solving for A: A =42 -4= -2.
