Q: India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. What's the total number of states in both countries together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of states in the USA. I recall that the United States has 50 states.

Next, the problem states that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To find half of 50, I divide 50 by 2, which equals 27.5.

Then, I add 4 to this value to find the number of states in India. So, 27.5 plus 4 equals 31. states in India.

Finally, to find the total number of states in both countries together, I add the number of states in the USA and India. That is 50 plus 31, which equals 86.
