Q: Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll define the number of insects found by each person. Let \( L \) represent the number found by Lily, \( D \) for David, and \( B \) for Bodhi.

According to the problem, the total number of insects collected by all three is 43. So, I can write the equation:
\[ L + D + B = 43 \]

Next, it's given that Lily found 7 more insects than David. This translates to:
\[ L = D + 7 \]

Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found. This means:
\[ D = \frac{1}{2}B \]

Now, I'll substitute \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \]

Substituting \( L \) and \( D \) into the total insects equation:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ 2B = 36 \]
\[ B = 36 \]

Now, I'll find \( D \) using the value of \( B \):
\[ D = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \]

Finally, I'll determine \( L \) using the value of \( D \):
\[ L = 18 + 7 = 25 \]

So, Lily found 25 insects.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi: 43
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

**Let:**
- \( L \) = number of insects found by Lily
- \( D \) = number of insects found by David
- \( B \) = number of insects found by Bodhi

**Step 1: Translate the given information into equations.**

1. **Total insects:**
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. **Lily found 7 more than David:**
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. **David found half of what Bodhi found:**
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B \quad \text{or} \quad B = 2D
   \]

**Step 2: Substitute \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation for \( L \).**

From equation 3:
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B \quad \Rightarrow \quad L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total insects equation.**

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

**Step 4: Combine like terms.**

\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( B \).**

\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]
\[
B = 18
\]

**Step 6: Find \( D \) using \( B = 18 \).**

\[
D = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

**Step 7: Find \( L \) using \( D = 9 \).**

\[
L = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
