Q: Nick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where four people—Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ—each have paintball guns. The numbers are: DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10, RJ has 1, and Richard has 5. The question is asking, if they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It says they are sharing their guns equally. So, I think that means we need to combine all their guns together and then divide them equally among the four of them. That makes sense because if they're sharing equally, each person should end up with the same number of guns.

Alright, so let me list out how many guns each person has:

- DJ: 8 guns
- Nick: 10 guns
- Richard: 5 guns
