Okay, so I need to figure out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

John likes to have a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. That means on each of those days, he drinks one glass. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, for the weekdays, he has water before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So, that's three glasses a day.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, for each weekday, he drinks three glasses. Then, on the weekends, he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead. So, on weekends, he doesn't drink water for dinner, but, that seems right. So, on weekends, he drinks water for breakfast and lunch, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, on weekends, he has water before breakfast and lunch, but, that seems right. So, that's two glasses a day on the weekend.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me break it down.

First, let's figure out how many weekdays there are. A week has seven days, right? So, five weekdays (Monday to Friday) and two weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So, that's five weekdays and two weekend days.

On weekdays, he drinks three glasses of water each day. So, for five weekdays, that would be 5 days multiplied by 3 glasses per day. Let me write that down: 5 * 3 = 15 glasses.

On weekends, he doesn't drink water for dinner, but, that seems right. So, on weekends, he drinks water for breakfast and lunch. So, that's two glasses a day. So, for two weekend days, that's 2 * 2 = 4 glasses.

So, total glasses of water he drinks in a week would be the sum of the glasses on weekdays and the glasses on weekends. So, 15 + 4 = 19 glasses.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 weekdays, 3 glasses each: 5*3=15. 2 weekend days, 2 glasses each: 2*2=4. 15+4=19. So, 19 glasses in a week.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 weekdays, 3 glasses each: 15. 2 weekend days, 2 glasses each: 4. 15+4=19. So, 19 glasses.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 19.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.
