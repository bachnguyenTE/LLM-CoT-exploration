Q: Carmen has $100, Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, and Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. How much do all three girls have combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so her amount is $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so her amount is $125 + $50 = $175.

Finally, to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, I add up the amounts each has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

Let's determine how much money each girl has and then find the total combined amount.

1. **Carmen's Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Carmen} = \$100
   \]

2. **Samantha's Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Samantha} = \text{Carmen} + \$25 = \$100 + \$25 = \$125
   \]

3. **Daisy's Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Daisy} = \text{Samantha} + \$50 = \$125 + \$50 = \$175
   \]

4. **Total Amount Combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Carmen} + \text{Samantha} + \text{Daisy} = \$100 + \$125 + \$175 = \$400
   \]

\[
\boxed{\$400}
\]
