Q: A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

Okay, so I have this problem here where a company bought $40,0000$ worth of equipment from a retailer. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I read that correctly. It says the company bought $400000 worth of equipment. So, that's $40,0000. Okay, got it. So, $400,000 total cost.

Now, the problem says that pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. So, 40% of the total number of equipment pieces were faulty. Then, they returned the faulty pieces to the seller. So, they're returning those faulty ones, which means they're getting a refund or something? Or maybe they're just not spending money on those faulty pieces anymore.

So, the question is asking me to calculate the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment. So, I need to figure out how much the company spent on the equipment that was working and not faulty.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the total cost is $40,0000. Wait, that seems right. So, $40,0000. So, that's 40 million and 000 dollars? Wait, that seems right. So, 40,0000 dollars.

Now, 40% of the total number of equipment pieces were faulty. So, 40% were faulty. So, that means 60% of the total number were working. So, the company is returning the faulty ones, so they're not spending money on those. So, the amount spent is 60% of the total cost.

Wait, that seems right. So, if 40% were faulty, then 100% - 40% = 60% were working. So, they spent 60% of the total amount on the working equipment.

So, to calculate that, I can take 60% of $40,0000. So, 0.6 times 40,0000.

Let me write that down.

Total cost: $40,0000

Percentage spent: 60% = 0.6

So, amount spent = 0.6 * 40,0000

Let me compute that.

0.6 * 40,0000 = ?

Well, 0.6 * 40,0000 is the same as 60% of 40,0000.

So, 60% of 40,0000.

So, 10% of 40,0000 is 4,000, so 60% is 6 times that, which is 24,000.

Wait, that seems right. 10% is 4,000, so 60% is 24,000.

So, the amount spent is $24,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, the company spent 60% of the total amount on the working equipment.

But, that seems right. So, 40,0000 total, 40% faulty, so 60% working. So, 0.6 * 40,0000 is 24,000.

So, the answer is $24,000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Total cost: $40,0000

40% faulty, so 60% working.

60% of 40,0000 is 0.6 * 40,0000.

0.6 * 40,0000.

Let me compute 40,0000 * 0.6.

40,0000 * 0.6.

Well, 40,0000 * 0.6 is the same as 40,0000 * 6 * 0.1.

Wait, that seems right. 40,0000 * 0.6 is 24,0000.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the amount spent is $24,000.

So, the answer is $24,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, the company spent 60% of the total amount on the working equipment, which is 24,000.

So, I think that's the answer.

But, that seems right. So, the company returned the faulty pieces, so they didn't spend money on those
