Q: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Vincent can buy flowers in two different packages. One is a package of 3 flowers for $2.50, and the other is a package of 2 flowers for $1. He wants to buy 18 flowers, and we need to figure out how much money he saves by buying at the better price. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out which package is cheaper per flower. That way, I can determine which one is the better deal. So, let's calculate the cost per flower for each package.

Starting with the package of 3 flowers for $2.50. To find the cost per flower, I can divide the total cost by the number of flowers. So, that would be $2.50 divided by 3. Let me do that calculation: 2.50 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 2.50 how many times? Well, 3 times 0 is 9, which is less than 10, so maybe 0.833... dollars per flower. Let me check: 3 times 0.833 is approximately 2.50. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, for the package of 2 flowers for $1. To find the cost per flower here, I'll divide $1 by 2. So, 1 ÷ 2 is 0.50 dollars per flower. That's 50 cents per flower. Comparing the two, the package of 2 flowers is cheaper at 50 cents per flower compared to the package of 3 flowers at approximately 83.33 cents per flower. So, the better deal is the package of 2 flowers.

Now, since Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, he should buy as many of the better deal packages as possible. So, let's figure out how many packages of 2 flowers he needs to buy to get 18 flowers. Since each package has 2 flowers, we can divide 18 by 2. Wait, that seems right. 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, he needs to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.

But, that seems right. 9 packages times 2 flowers each is 18 flowers. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
