Okay, so I have this problem here about a basketball tournament with four schools. Each school sends a girls' team and a boys' team, and each of those teams has 5 players. Plus, each team has a coach. The question is asking how many people all the schools have sent in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how many teams there are in total. There are four schools, and each school sends two teams: one girls' and one boys'. So, that would be 4 schools multiplied by 2 teams per school. Let me write that out: 4 * 2 = 8 teams. So, there are 8 teams in total.

Now, each team has 5 players. So, for each team, there are 5 players. Since there are 8 teams, I can multiply the number of teams by the number of players per team to get the total number of players. That would be 8 * 5. Let me calculate that: 8*5 is 40. Wait, that seems right. So, 8 teams with 5 players each make 40 players.
