Q: Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about two people, Betsy and Donovan, working together to make a meal. The total time they took was 98 minutes. Importantly, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. So, I need to find out how long Betsy's part was.

Let me think about how to model this. It seems like a problem where we have two people working together, each contributing a part of the meal, and the total time is the sum of their individual times. So, if I let Betsy's time be one variable and Donovan's time be another, I can set up an equation.

Let me denote the time Betsy took as B minutes. Then, since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, that means Donovan's time would be B minus 18 minutes. Wait, that seems right. So, if Betsy took B minutes, then Donovan took B - 18 minutes.

Now, the total time they took together is 98 minutes. So, the sum of Betsy's time and Donovan's time should equal 98 minutes. So, I can write that as:

B + (B - 18) = 98

Let me write that down:

B + (B - 18) = 98

Simplify that equation. Let's combine like terms. So, B + B is 2B, and then minus 18. So:

2B - 18 = 98

Now, I need to solve for B. Let me add 18 to both sides to get rid of the -18 on the left.

2B -18 +18 = 98 +18

Which simplifies to:

2B = 116

Now, to find B, I need to divide both sides by 2.

2B / 2 = 116 / 2

So, B = 58

Wait, that seems right. So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. Let me check if that makes sense.

If Betsy took 58 minutes, then Donovan took 58 -18 = 40 minutes. So, 58 + 40 is 98 minutes, which matches the total time given. So, that seems to check out.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, Betsy took 58 minutes, which is 18 minutes longer than Donovan's 40 minutes. 58 + 40 is 98. Yeah, that adds up.

Wait, that seems right. So, is 58 the correct answer? It seems straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a system of equations. Let me define variables again.

Let B = Betsy's time

D = Donovan's time

Given that B = D + 18

And B + D = 98

So, substituting the first equation into the second:

(D +18) + D = 98

Which is 2D +18 =98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2D =80

Divide by 2: D=40

Then, B=40 +18=58

Same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a word problem. If the total time is 98 minutes, and Betsy took 18 minutes more than Donovan, then the difference in their times is 18 minutes. So, if I imagine the total time as the sum of their individual times, the difference is 18 minutes.

So, if I think of it as two people working together, the total time is 98 minutes, and the difference in their times is 18 minutes. So, the average time would be (98)/2=49 minutes. But, that seems right. So, Betsy is 18 minutes above the average, and Donovan is 18 minutes below the average.

So, Betsy's time is 49 +18=67 minutes? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems
