Q: From her science class study, Brady learned that each whale in the sea has 40 gallons of blood. She also learned that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about whales and sharks and their blood gallons. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Hmm, so if a whale has 40 gallons, a shark must have 3 times that amount. Let me write that down to make it clear.

So, for one whale: 40 gallons.

For one shark: 3 times 40 gallons. Let me calculate that. 3 multiplied by 40. Hmm, 3 times 40 is 120. So, each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Now, the question is asking for the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have. So, if one shark is 120 gallons, then ten sharks would be 10 times that amount. Let me write that out.

Number of sharks: 10.

Total blood for ten sharks: 10 multiplied by 120.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10 times 120. Let me compute that. 10 times 120. Hmm, 10 times 100 is 1100, and 10 times 20 is 220. So, adding those together, 1100 + 220 is 1330. So, 10 times 120 is 1200, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
