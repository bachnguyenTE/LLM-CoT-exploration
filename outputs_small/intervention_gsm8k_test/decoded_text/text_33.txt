Q: Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and these coins are either gold or silver. It also says there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, I need to find out how many gold coins she has.

Let me break this down. Let's denote the number of silver coins as a variable. Let's say the number of silver coins is S. Then, since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins would be S + 30. That makes sense because if there are 30 more gold coins, you just add 30 to the number of silver coins to get the number of gold coins.

So, if I let S be the number of silver coins, then the number of gold coins is S + 30. Now, the total number of coins is 110. That means the sum of silver coins and gold coins is 110. So, I can write an equation:

S (silver coins) + (S + 30) (gold coins) = 110

Let me write that out:

S + (S + 30) = 110

Now, let's simplify this equation. Combine like terms:

S + S + 30 = 110

That simplifies to:

2S + 30 = 110

Wait, that seems right. So, 2S plus 30 equals 110. Now, I need to solve for S. Let me subtract 30 from both sides to get:

2S = 110 - 30

Which is:

2S = 80

Okay, so 2S equals 80. To find S, I divide both sides by 2:

S = 80 / 2

Which is:

S = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

If there are 40 silver coins, then the number of gold coins is 40 + 30, which is 70. So, 40 silver plus 70 gold is 110 coins in total. That adds up correctly.

Let me just double-check my equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I set S as the number of silver coins, then gold coins are S + 30. Total coins: S + (S +30) = 110. That simplifies to 2S +30 =110, so 2S=80, so S=40. Then, gold coins are 70. 40 +70=110. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the number of gold coins is 70. So, the answer should be 70.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using algebra differently or another method.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total number of coins is 110, and the difference between gold and silver is 30. So, if I consider the total coins as the sum of silver and gold, and the difference as 30, I can set up equations.

Let me denote G as the number of gold coins and S as the number of silver coins. So, G = S +30, and G + S =110.

So, substituting G in the second equation:

(S +30) + S =110

Which is 2S +30=110, same as before. So, 2S=80, S=40, G=70. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as if the difference is 30, so the total number of coins is 110, which is equal to the number of silver coins plus the number of gold coins, which is 30 more than silver. So, if I imagine that the total is 110, and the difference is 30, then the number of silver coins is (110 -30)/2, which is 80/2=40, so 40 silver coins, and 70 gold coins.

Wait, that seems right. So, in all cases, the number of gold coins is 70.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as if the difference is 30, so the total is
