Q: It costs $194 per meter to repave a street. Monica's street is 150 meters long. How much more does it cost to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about repaving streets, and I need to figure out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says that repaving a street costs $194 per meter. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long. The question is asking how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street. Hmm, okay.

First, I think I need to calculate the cost for both streets and then find the difference. That makes sense because if I know how much each costs, subtracting the smaller one from the larger one will give me the extra cost.

So, let's start with Monica's street. It's 150 meters long, and the cost is $194 per meter. To find the total cost, I should multiply the length by the cost per meter. Let me write that down:

Monica's cost = 150 meters * $194/meter

Hmm, let me compute that. 150 times 194. Hmm, that might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can break it down. 150 times 200 would be 30,000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
