Q: James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A, some to District B and 209 newspapers to District C. How many newspapers does he deliver to District B?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A, some to District B, and 209 newspapers to District C. The question is asking how many newspapers he delivers to District B. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers each day. That's the total number. Now, he delivers 198 to District A and 209 to District C. So, if I can find out how many he delivers to District B, that should be the answer. 

I think the way to approach this is by subtracting the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total. So, if I add up the newspapers delivered to A and C, and then subtract that sum from the total, I should get the number for B. Let me write that down.

Total newspapers = 600

Newspapers to A = 198

Newspapers to C = 209

So, the newspapers to B would be Total - (A + C). Let me compute A + C first.

198 + 229. Hmm, let me add those numbers. 198 plus 229. Let's see, 198 plus 200 is 418, and then plus 9 more is 427. Wait, that seems right. 198 + 229 is 427.

So, now, subtract that from the total. 660 - 427. Hmm, 660 minus 427. Let me do this subtraction. 660 minus 400 is 220, and then minus 27 more. So, 220 minus 27 is 193. Wait, that seems right. Let me check my subtraction another way.

Alternatively, 660 minus 427. Let's break it down:

660 minus 400 is 260.

260 minus 27 is 233. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
