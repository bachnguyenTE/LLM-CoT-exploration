Okay, so Tom bought a bedroom set for $3000. Hmm, that's a bit expensive, but, that seems right. Then he sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set. Alright, so he gets $1000 back. That means he doesn't have to pay the full $3000 right away. Instead, he can use that $1000 to cover some of the cost.

So, let me think about how much he still needs to pay. The total cost was $3000, and he got $1000 back. So, subtracting those, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2300. Wait, that seems right. So, he still has $2300 to pay for the bedroom set.

Now, he has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set. Hmm, 10% a month. So, that's a monthly interest rate, right? So, each month, he has to pay 10% of the remaining balance. But, that seems right. So, he's paying 10% of $2300 each month.

Wait, that seems right. So, to find out how much he has to pay per month, I need to calculate 10% of $2300. Let me do that. 10% of $2300 is 0.10 multiplied by 2300. So, 0.10 * 2300. Let me compute that.

First, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 0.10 is 230 + 10% of 2300. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 10% of 2300 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 10% of 2300 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.1 is 230. So, 2300 * 0.
