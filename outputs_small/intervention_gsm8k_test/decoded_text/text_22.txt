Q: Billy sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many DVDs Billy sold to his first 3 customers. Since each of these customers bought one DVD, the total number of DVDs sold to them is 3 multiplied by 1, which equals 3.

Next, I'll calculate the number of DVDs sold to his next 2 customers. Each of these customers bought 2 DVDs, so the total is 2 multiplied by 2, resulting in 4.

Finally, the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so they contributed 0 DVDs to the total.

Adding these amounts together, 3 plus 4 equals 7. Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

**Solution:**

Billy sells DVDs to his customers in groups. Let's break down the sales:

1. **First 3 customers:**
   - Each buys **1 DVD**.
   - Total DVDs sold: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) DVDs.

2. **Next 2 customers:**
   - Each buys **2 DVDs**.
   - Total DVDs sold: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) DVDs.

3. **Last 3 customers:**
   - Each buys **0 DVDs**.
   - Total DVDs sold: \( 3 \times 0 = 0 \) DVDs.

**Total DVDs Sold:**
\[
3 \text{ (from first 3 customers)} + 4 \text{ (from next 2 customers)} + 0 \text{ (from last 3 customers)} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
