Q: Three of the women at the cocktail party are wearing 4 inch heels and three are wearing 2 inch heels. What is the average height of heels at this party?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three women at a cocktail party wearing different pairs of heels. Let me try to figure out the average height of the heels. Hmm, the question says that three women are wearing 4-inch heels and three are wearing 2-inch heels. I need to find the average height of the heels at the party. 

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that average height is calculated by adding up all the heights and then dividing by the number of items. In this case, the items are the heels worn by the women. So, I need to find the total number of inches of heels and then divide that by the total number of women.

Wait, that seems right. So, there are three women with 4-inch heels and three with 2-inch heels. Let me write that down to visualize it better. 

Number of women with 4-inch heels: 3
Number of women with 2-inch heels: 3

So, total number of women is 3 + 3, which is 6. That makes sense because there are six women in total at the party.

Now, for the total inches of heels. Each of the three women with 4-inch heels has 4 inches, so that's 3 times 4. Similarly, each of the three women with 2-inch heels has 2 inches, so that's 3 times 2. Let me calculate that.

Total inches from 4-inch heels: 3 * 4 = 12 inches
Total inches from 2-inch heels: 3 * 2 = 6 inches

So, adding those together, the total inches of heels is 12 + 6, which is 18 inches.

Now, to find the average, I need to divide the total inches by the number of women. So, that's 18 inches divided by 6 women.

18 / 6 = 3

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches. Hmm, that seems a bit short for heels, but, that seems right. Maybe it's a small brand or something. Anyway, the math checks out.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I identified the number of women and their respective heel sizes. Then, I calculated the total inches by multiplying the number of women by the heel size for each group. Then, I added those totals together. Finally, I divided by the total number of women to get the average. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 women with 4-inch heels contribute 12-inch total, and 3 women with 2-inch heels contribute 6 inches total. 12 inches in total, divided by 6 women is 2 inches.
