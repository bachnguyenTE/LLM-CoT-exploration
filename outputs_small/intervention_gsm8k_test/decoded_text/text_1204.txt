Q: Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?

Okay, so I have this problem here where twenty tourists found 700 shells in a mall parking lot. They divided into three groups: Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters. The Alphas found 40% of the shells, and the The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. I need to figure out how many shells the Gogetters found. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 20 tourists in total, and they split into three groups. The first group is Alphas, who found 40% of the shells. Then, the The finders group found 60% of the remaining shells after the Alphas had taken their share. The rest went to the Gogetters, and I need to find out how many shells that was.

So, the total number of shells is 700. Let me write that down:

Total shells = 700

First, the Alphas found 40% of these shells. So, I need to calculate 40% of 700. To do that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.

40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form. So, 0.40 multiplied by 700.

Let me compute that:

0.40 * 700

Hmm, 0.4 times 700 is 280, right? Because 0.4 is 2/5, and 700 divided by 5 is 140, so 2/5 is 140. Wait, that seems right. So, 0.4 * 700 = 280.

So, the Alphas found 280 shells.

Now, the remaining shells after the Alphas have taken their share would be 700 - 280. Let me subtract that:

700 - 280 = 420

So, there are 420 shells left after the Alphas.

Next, the The finders group found 60% of these remaining shells. So, I need to calculate 60% of 420.

Again, converting 60% to a decimal is 0.60. So, 0.60 multiplied by 420.

Let me compute that:

0.6 * 420

Hmm, 0.6 is 3/5, so 420 divided by 5 is 84, and 3/5 of that is 50.4. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, 0.6 * 400 is 240, and 0.6 * 20 is 0, so 240. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
