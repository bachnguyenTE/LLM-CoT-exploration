Q: As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Okay, so Sally was walking to school and she had some balloons. Let me try to figure out how many balloons she ended up carrying into school. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, she had 25 red balloons, 7 green, and 12 yellow. So, initially, that's 25 + 7 + 12. Let me add those up. 25 plus 7 is 32, and 32 plus 12 is 44. So, she started with 44 balloons.

Then, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. Wait, that seems right. 40% of red balloons. So, 40% of 25. Let me calculate that. 40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal. So, 0.40 multiplied by 25. Let me do that: 0.40 * 25. Hmm, 0.4 times 25 is 2, and 0.0 times 25 is 0, so total is 2. So, 2 red balloons burst. So, she now has 25 - 2 = 23 red balloons left.

Next, the wind caused her to accidentally release half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6. So, she lost 6 yellow balloons. That means she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Then, as she approached the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree. So, she adds 8 blue balloons to her clutch. Now, she had 23 red, 6 yellow, and 8 blue. Wait, that seems right. So, 23 + 6 + 8. Let me add that up: 23 + 6 is 29, and 8 more is 17. So, she has 17 balloons before she adds the 75% of the blue ones.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
