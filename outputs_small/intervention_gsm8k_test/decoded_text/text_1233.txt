Q: Walter bought 60 apples from the store. He ate 2/5 of them and gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. If he then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, how much money did he receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Walter bought 60 apples. Hmm, let me write that down. He ate 2/5 of them. Alright, so first step is to figure out how many apples he ate. 

To find 2/5 of 60, I can calculate 66 multiplied by 2/5. Let me do that: 66 * 2 = 132, and then 132 divided by 5 is... 26.4? Wait, that seems right. So he ate 26.4 apples. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2/5 of 66 is 26.4. Okay, so he ate 26.4 apples.

Now, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining number. So after eating 26.4, how many apples does he have left? Let me subtract 26.4 from 66. So 66 - 26.4 is 39.6 apples left. Okay, so he has 39.6 apples remaining.

He then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. So I need to find out how much money he received from selling them. That would be the number of apples he sold multiplied by $3.

So, 39.6 apples sold at $3 each. Let me calculate that: 39.6 * 3. Hmm, 40 * 3 is 120, so 39.6 is 0.4 less than 40, so 0.4 * 3 is 1.2. So 120 - 1.2 is 118.8. So he received $118.8.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 2/5 of 66 is 26.4, correct. 66 - 26.4 is 39.6, correct. 25% of 39.6 is 9.9, so 39.6 - 9.9 is 29.7. Wait, that seems right.
