Q: Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Maggie and Riza each have $60. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and Riza spent a third of hers. I need to figure out how much money they have left together. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's tackle Maggie's situation. She started with $60 and spent a quarter of it. A quarter is the same as 1/4, right? So, to find out how much she spent, I can calculate 1/4 of 60. Let me write that out: 1/4 * 60. Hmm, 60 divided by 4 is... let me see, 4 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 2, then bring down the 0 to make 20. 4 goes into 22 five times, which is 20, subtract that, and you have 2 again. So, 60 divided by 4 is 16.5? Wait, that seems right. So, 1/4 of 60 is $16.50. So, she spent $16.50.

Now, to find out how much she has left, I subtract that from her original amount. So, 60 minus 16.50. Let me do that subtraction. 60 minus 16 is 48, and then minus 0.50 is 47.50. So, Maggie has $47.50 left.

Alright, moving on to Riza. She also started with $60, but, that seems right. She spent a third of her money. A third is 1/3. So, 1/3 of 60. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 3 is 22. So, Riza spent $22.00.

Now, subtracting that from her original amount: 60 minus 22. That's straightforward. 60 minus 20 is 40, and then minus 2 more is 38. So, Riza has $38.00 left.

Now, to find the total amount of money they have left together, I need to add up what Maggie has left and what Riza has left. So, that's 47.50 plus 3.80. Let me add those together. 47 plus 3 is 50, and 0.50 plus 0.80 is 1.30. So, 50 plus 1.30 is 51.30.

Wait, that seems right. So, together, they have $51.30 left. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with Maggie: 60 minus 16.50 is indeed 43.50. Wait, that seems right. 16.50 plus 43.50 is 60. Okay, that checks out.

Riza: 60 minus 22 is 38. That's correct.

Adding them together: 43.50 plus 38.00. 43 plus 38 is 81, and 0.50 plus 0.00 is 0.50. So, 81 plus 0.50 is 81.50. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
