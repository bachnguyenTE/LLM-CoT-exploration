Q: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three ropes: red, blue, and yellow. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says, "The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope." Hmm, so if I let the length of the blue rope be some variable, say B, then the red rope would be 4 times that, right? So, red rope length = 4B. That makes sense.

Next, it says, "The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope." Hmm, okay, so if the blue rope is shorter than the yellow one by 7 cm, that means the yellow rope is longer than the blue one by 7 cm. So, if I let the length of the yellow rope be Y, then Y = B + 7. Got it.

Now, the problem also mentions that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, red + blue + yellow = 37 cm. I can write that as an equation: 4B + B + Y = 37. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: red is 4B, blue is B, yellow is B + 7. So, adding them up: 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, let me write that equation down:

4B + B + (B + 7) = 37

Let me simplify that. Combine like terms. So, 4B + B is 5B, and then another B is 6B. So, 6B + 7 = 37.

Wait, that seems right. So, 6B + 7 = 37. Now, I need to solve for B. So, subtract 7 from both sides:

6B = 37 - 7

Which is 6B = 30.

Then, divide both sides by 6:

B = 30 / 6

So, B = 5. So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: if blue is 5, then red is 4 times that, so 20 cm. Yellow is blue +7, so 5 +7 =12 cm. So, red is 20, blue is 5, yellow is 12. Let me add them up: 20 +5 +12 =37. Yes, that adds up to 37. So, that seems correct.

So, the question is asking for the length of the red rope, which is 20 centimeters. So, the answer should be 20.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Let blue rope length be B.
2. Red rope is 4B.
3. Yellow rope is B +7.
4. Total length: 4B + B + (B +7) = 37.
5. Simplify: 6B +7 =37.
6. Subtract 7: 6B=30.
7. Divide by6: B=5.
8. Then red rope is 4*5=20.

Yes, that all checks out. So, the red rope is 20 centimeters long.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It all adds up correctly, so I'm confident that 20 is the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The length of the red rope is \boxed{20} centimeters.

Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
4B + B + B + 7 = 37
\]
\[
6B + 7 = 37
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
6B = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[
B = 5
\]

The length of the red rope is \( 4B \):

\[
4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters.
