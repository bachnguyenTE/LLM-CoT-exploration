Q: Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Tyson would spend on making muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for each sandwich, he needs 1 pound of each ingredient. That means for each sandwich, he uses 2 pounds in total—1 for meat and 1 for cheese.

Now, each sandwich serves 4 people. So, if he makes one sandwich, it can feed 4 people. The total number of people watching the game is 20. So, he needs enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

Let me calculate how many sandwiches he needs to make. If each sandwich serves 4 people, then the number of sandwiches required is the total number of people divided by the number of people each sandwich serves. So, that would be 20 people divided by 4 people per sandwich.

Let me write that down:

Number of sandwiches = Total people / People per sandwich
Number of sandwiches = 20 / 4
Number of sandwiches = 5

So, he needs to make 5 sandwiches to serve all 20 people.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. So, for 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Now, let's figure out the cost. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

Calculating the cost for meat:
Cost of meat = Number of pounds of meat * Cost per pound
Cost of meat = 5 * $7.00
Cost of meat = $35.00

Calculating the cost for cheese:
Cost of cheese = Number of pounds of cheese * Cost per pound
Cost of cheese = 5 * $3.00
Cost of cheese = $15.00

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of meat and the cost of cheese together.

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00
Total cost = $50.000

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Number of sandwiches: 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches. That makes sense.

Meat needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound = 5 pounds. 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

Cheese needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound = 5 pounds. 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Total cost: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Hmm, that seems straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the cost per sandwich first and then multiply by the number of sandwiches. Let's see.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so 2 pounds per sandwich. The cost per pound for meat is $7.00, and cheese is $3.00. So, the cost per sandwich would be:

Cost per sandwich = (Cost of meat + Cost of cheese) per sandwich
Cost per sandwich = (1 * $7.00 + 1 * $3.00)
Cost per sandwich = $7.00 + $3.00
Cost per sandwich = $10.00

So, each sandwich costs $10.00. Then, for 5 sandwiches, the total cost is 5 * $10.00 = $50.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, both methods give me the same total cost of $50.00. So, that must be the correct answer.

I think I'm confident that the total cost is $50.00. So, the answer should be $50.00.

**Final Answer**
The total cost for the meat and cheese is \boxed{50.00}.

To determine how much money Tyson would spend on making muffaletta sandwiches for the big game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people, given that each sandwich serves 4 people:
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed for 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:
   \[
