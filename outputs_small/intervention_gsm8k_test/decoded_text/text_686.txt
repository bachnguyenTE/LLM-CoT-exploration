Q: Greta and Celinda are baking cookies. Greta bakes 30 cookies and Celinda bakes twice as many. If the pair eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling and put the rest in a box, how many cookies are there in the box?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Greta and Celinda baking cookies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Greta bakes 30 cookies. That seems straightforward. Then it mentions Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta. Hmm, so if Greta made 30, Celinda must have made double that amount. Let me write that down to keep track.

Greta's cookies: 30  
 Celinda's cookies: 2 × 30

Wait, that seems right. So 2 times 30 is... let me calculate that. 2 × 30 is 60. So Celinda bakes 60 cookies. Okay, so Greta has 30 and Celinda has 60. 

Now, the next part says they eat 10 of the cookies while they're cooling. So they both eat 10 together. I need to subtract that from the total number of cookies they baked. 

Total cookies baked: Greta's + Celinda's = 30 + 60  
Let me add those up. 30 + 60 is 90. So together, they baked 90 cookies. 

Then, they eat 10 of them. So the remaining cookies are 90 - 10. Let me subtract that. 90 minus 10 is 80. Wait, that seems right. 90 minus 10 is 80? Wait, that seems right. 90 minus 10 is 80? Wait, that seems right. 90 minus 10 is 80, so 90 minus 11 is 89. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
