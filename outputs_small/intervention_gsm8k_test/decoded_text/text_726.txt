Q: Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s shoes?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Topher and Bobby's shoes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoes. And Topher's shoes are 8 feet and 4 inches long. I need to find out how long Bobby's shoes are in inches.

First, I should probably convert all the measurements to the same unit to make it easier. The problem mentions inches, so I should convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches. I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 8 feet would be 8 times 12 inches. Let me calculate that.

8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Then, adding the extra 4 inches, that makes Topher's shoes 96 + 4 = 100 inches long. Wait, that seems right. 8 feet is 96 inches, plus 4 inches is 100 inches. Okay, so Topher's shoes are 100 inches long.

Now, the problem says that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length. Let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Bobby's shoe length as B inches. So, according to the problem:

Topher's shoe length = 9 * Bobby's shoe length + 10 inches.

In equation form, that's:

100 = 9B + 10.

Wait, that seems right. So, 100 inches is equal to 9 times Bobby's shoe length plus 10 inches. Now, I need to solve for B.

Let me subtract 10 inches from both sides to get:

100 - 10 = 9B.

So, 100 - 10 is 90, so 90 = 9B.

Then, to find B, I divide both sides by 9:

90 / 9 = B.

Wait, that seems right. 90 divided by 9 is 10. So, B is 10 inches. So, Bobby's shoes are 10 inches long.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Topher's shoes are 100 inches, which is 8 feet 4 inches. 8 feet is 96 inches, plus 4 inches is 100 inches. Then, 9 times Bobby's shoe length plus 10 inches equals Topher's shoe length. So, 9B +10 =100. Subtract 10, get 90=9B, so B=10. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Bobby's shoes are much shorter than Topher's. 10 inches is about 0.833 feet, which is about 1 foot 2 inches. That seems reasonable for shoes.

Wait, that seems right. So, Bobby's shoes are 10 inches long. So, the answer is 10 inches.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the equation.

Topher's shoe length = 9 * Bobby's shoe length +10.

So, 100 =9B +10.

Subtract 10: 90=9B.

Divide by 9: B=10.

Yes, that's correct. So, Bobby's shoes are 10 inches long.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 10 inches.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The length of one of Bobby’s shoes is \boxed{10} inches.
