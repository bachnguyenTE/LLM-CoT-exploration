Q: The price of a laptop is $1000. If you get a 20% discount, how much do you have to pay?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate 20% of $1000. To do this, I'll multiply 1000 by 0.20, which gives me $200.

Next, I'll subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount to pay. So, $1000 minus $200 equals $800.

Therefore, after applying the 20% discount, the final price of the laptop is $800.

**Solution:**

To determine the final price of the laptop after applying a 20% discount, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = \$200
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**
   
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \$1000 - \$200 = \$800
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$800}
\]
