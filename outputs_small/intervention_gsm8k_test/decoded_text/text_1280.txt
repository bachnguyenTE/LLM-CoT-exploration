Q: Steve put together a puzzle that took 10 hours of hard work to complete. Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. How long did it take Anna to finish the difficult puzzle?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Steve and Anna working on a puzzle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Steve took 10 hours to put together the puzzle. That part is straightforward. So, Steve's time is 10 hours. 

Now, the next part is about Anna. It says Anna put together the same puzzle in 2 hours more than half Steve's time. Hmm, okay, so I need to break this down. 

Let me write down what I know:

- Steve's time (S) = 10 hours
- Anna's time (A) = ?

The problem says Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, first, I need to find half of Steve's time, and then add 2 hours to that.

So, half of Steve's time would be (1/2) * S. Since S is 10 hours, that would be (1/2) * 10. Let me calculate that. Half of 10 is 5. So, half of Steve's time is 5 hours.

Now, Anna took 2 hours more than that. So, I need to add 2 hours to 5 hours. That would be 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Wait, that seems right. So, Anna took 7 hours to put together the puzzle. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Steve's time: 10 hours. That's given.
2. Half of Steve's time: 10 / 2 = 5 hours. That makes sense.
3. Anna's time is 2 hours more than that: 5 + 2 = 7 hours. Yeah, that seems correct.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using algebra? Let me try that to confirm.

Let’s denote Steve's time as S and Anna's time as A.

Given:
- S = 10 hours
- A = (1/2) * S + 2

Plugging in the value of S:
A = (1/2)*10 + 2
A = 5 + 2
A = 7

So, that's the same result as before. Hmm, so both methods give me 7 hours. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, Anna took 7 hours. Let me think if there's any other interpretation of the problem that might lead to a different answer.

The problem says Anna took 2 hours more than half Steve's time. So, is it half of Steve's time plus 2, or is it half of (Steve's time plus 2)? Hmm, that's a good point. Let me check.

If it were half of (Steve's time plus 2), then it would be (1/2)*(10 + 2) = (1/2)*12 = 6 hours. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the problem says "2 hours more than half Steve's time." So, it's half of Steve's time, then add 2. So, that would be 5 + 2 = 7.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 7 hours.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that 7 is the correct answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret it. Maybe "2 hours more than half of the time it took Steve to do it." So, half of Steve's time is 5, plus 2 is 7. Yeah, that's the same.

Alternatively, if it were half of (Steve's time plus 2), that would be 6, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the problem says "2 hours more than half Steve's time," so it's 5 + 2 = 7.

So, yeah, I think 7 is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I can conclude that Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

**Final Answer**
The time it took Anna to finish the puzzle is \boxed{7} hours.
</think>

Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. 

First, we calculate half of Steve's time:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we add 2 hours to this result to find Anna's time:
\[
5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time it took Anna to finish the puzzle is \boxed{7} hours.
