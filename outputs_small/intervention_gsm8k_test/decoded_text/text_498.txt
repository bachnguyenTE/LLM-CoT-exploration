Q: Brianne and Ashley make greek orange pie. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, while Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. If one greek orange pie needs three oranges, how many greek orange pies can they make?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make together. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's see how many oranges Ashley brought. The problem says she brought five boxes, and each box has ten oranges. So, to find the total number of oranges Ashley has, I can multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box. That would be 5 boxes multiplied by 10 oranges per box. Let me write that down:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.

Alright, so Ashley has 50 oranges. Now, Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Hmm, so I need to add 22 to the number of oranges Ashley has. Let me calculate that:

50 oranges (Ashley's) + 22 oranges = 72 oranges.

So, Brianne has 72 oranges. Now, to find the total number of oranges they have together, I need to add Ashley's oranges and Brianne's oranges:

50 oranges + 72 oranges = 122 oranges.

Wait, that seems right. 50 plus 72 is 122. Okay, so together they have 122 oranges.

Now, each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. So, to find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie. Let me write that:

122 oranges / 3 oranges per pie.

Hmm, let me do that division. 122 divided by 3. Let me see, 3 goes into 12 four times, so 4. Then, 3 goes into 0 zero times, so 0. Then, 3 goes into 2 how many times? Well, 3 goes into 2 zero times, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
