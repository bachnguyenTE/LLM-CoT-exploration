Q: It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: It says that the distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. Then it says Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, and the question is asking how many kilometers she will still need to drive. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's giving me the total distance between two cities and the distance Bernice has already driven. I need to find out how much more she needs to drive. So, it's a subtraction problem, I think. I should subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance to find the remaining distance.

Let me write that down. The total distance is 1955 kilometers, and she drove 325 kilometers. So, the remaining distance should be 1955 minus 325. Let me do that calculation.

1955 minus 325. Hmm, let me subtract step by step. Starting from the units place: 5 minus 5 is 0. Then, moving to the tens place: 5 minus 2 is 3. Next, the hundreds place: 9 minus 3 is 6. Finally, the thousands place: 1 minus 0 is 1. So, putting it all together, that gives me 1630 kilometers.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my subtraction. Sometimes when I do subtraction in my head, I might make a mistake. So, 1955 minus 325. Let me break it down differently. 1955 minus 300 is 1655, and then subtracting another 25 gives me 1630. Yeah, that matches what I did before. So, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. 1955 minus 325 is indeed 1630. So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 325 is less than 1955, so subtracting 325 from 1955 should give a positive number, which it does. So, 1630 is the correct answer.

Is there another way to check this? Maybe by adding 325 to 1630 and seeing if it equals 1955. Let's try that. 1630 plus 325. 1630 plus 300 is 1930, and then plus 25 is 1955. Yes, that works. So, that confirms that 1630 is the correct remaining distance.

So, I think that's the answer. She still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

**Final Answer**
The number of kilometers Bernice will still need to drive is \boxed{1630}.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. To find out how many kilometers she will still need to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

\[
1955 \text{ kilometers} - 325 \text{ kilometers} = 1630 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Thus, the number of kilometers Bernice will still need to drive is \boxed{1630}.
