Q: Larry loves taking care of animals.  He has 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.  He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  How many pets does Larry have?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many pets Larry has. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step. 

First, Larry has 3 cats. That's straightforward. So, number of cats = 3.

Next, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Hmm, so if he has 3 cats, then the number of dogs would be 3 multiplied by the number of cats. Let me write that down:

Number of dogs = 3 * number of cats = 3 * 3 = 9.

Alright, so he has 9 dogs.

Then, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, if he has 9 dogs, the number of rabbits would be 9 minus 2. Let me calculate that:

Number of rabbits = number of dogs - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7.

So, 7 rabbits.

Moving on, he has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, if he has 7 rabbits, the number of fish would be 3 multiplied by 7. Let me write that:

Number of fish = 3 * number of rabbits = 3 * 7 = 21.

So, 21 fish in the tank.

Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, if he has 21 fish, the number of gerbils would be 1/3 of 21. Let me compute that:

Number of gerbils = (1/3) * number of fish = (1/3) * 21 = 7.

Wait, that seems right. 21 divided by 3 is 7.

Now, the question is asking how many pets Larry has. So, I need to add up all the pets: cats, dogs, rabbits, and gerbils.

Let me list them out:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Gerbils: 7

Adding them together: 3 + 9 +7 +7.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3 + 9 = 12.

Then, 12 + 7 = 19.

Next, 19 +7 = 26.

So, total number of pets Larry has is 26.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with cats: 3. That's given.

Dogs: 3 times as many as cats. 3*3=9. That's correct.

Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs. 9-2=7. Correct.

Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits. 3*7=21. Correct.

Gerbils: 1/3 of the number of fish. 21/3=7. Correct.

Adding them up: 3+9=12, 12+7=19, 19+7=26. Yep, that adds up.

So, I think 26 is the correct total number of pets.

**Final Answer**
The total number of pets Larry has is \boxed{26}.

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\). He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\). He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\). He has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish, so the number of gerbils is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7\).

Adding up all the pets: cats, dogs, rabbits, and gerbils.

\[
3 \text{ (cats)} + 9 \text{ (dogs)} + 7 \text{ (rabbits)} + 7 \text{ (gerbils)} = 26
\]

The total number of pets Larry has is \(\boxed{26}\).
