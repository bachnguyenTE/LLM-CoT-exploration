Q: James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about James buying CDs and then selling some of them. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD costs $15. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, he buys 10 CDs, each at $15. But, that seems right. Let me write that down.

So, total cost before any discounts or sales would be 10 CDs multiplied by $15 each. Let me calculate that: 10 * 15. Hmm, 10 times 10 is 100, and 10 times 5 is 50, so adding those together, 100 + 50 is 155. So, the total cost is $155. 

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10 CDs at $15 each is 155. Okay, so that's the initial cost. 

Now, the next part says he gets them for 40% off. Wait, that seems right. So, 40% off. So, he's getting them at a discount. So, I need to calculate the discounted price per CD. 

So, first, let me find out what 40% of $15 is. To find the discount, I can calculate 40% of 15. So, 40% is 0.40 in decimal, so 0.40 * 15. Let me compute that: 0.40 * 15. Hmm, 0.4 * 15 is 6, and 0.00 *15 is 0, so total is 6. So, the discount is $6. 

Therefore, the discounted price per CD is the original price minus the discount. So, $15 - $6 is $9. So, each CD costs James $9 after the discount. 

So, now, he buys 10 CDs at $9 each. Let me calculate that total cost after discount. 10 * 9. That's 90. So, he spends $90 in total after the discount. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he bought 10 CDs at $15 each, which is $150, but, that seems right. Then, he gets them for 40% off, so he pays $9 each, which is $90. So, he saved $60 in total. 

But, that seems right. So, he spends $90 instead of $150. So, he saved $60. 

But, that seems right. So, moving on. 

Then, he decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. So, he's selling 5 CDs. So, he sells 5 CDs at a certain price. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he sells 5 CDs, and he sells them for 40. So, I need to figure out what price he sells them for. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he sells them for 40. So, is that 40 dollars? Or is that 40 dollars per CD? Wait, that seems right. So, he sells 5 CDs for 40. So, that's 40 dollars total. So, per CD, that would be 40 divided by 5, which is 8. So, he sells each CD for $8. 

So, he sells 5 CDs at $8 each. So, the total revenue from selling is 5 * 8. Let me compute that: 5 * 8 is 40. So, he makes $40 from selling the CDs. 

So, now, to find out how much money he was out, I need to subtract the revenue from the total cost. So, he spent $90 and made $40. So, the net amount he's out is 90 - 40. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 minus 40 is 50. So, he's out $50. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he spent $90, made $40, so net loss is $50. 

But, that seems right. So, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

He buys 10 CDs at $15 each: 10 *15 = 150. Then, gets them for 40% off, so 40% of 15 is 6, so 15 -6 =9 per CD. So, 10 *9 =90
