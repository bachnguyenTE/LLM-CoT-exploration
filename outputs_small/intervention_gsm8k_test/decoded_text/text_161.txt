Q: Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. While Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish were they able to catch?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Anakin and Locsin catching different kinds of fish at the beach. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Anakin caught some starfish, sea horses, and clownfish. Specifically, Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That part seems straightforward. So, Anakin's catches are 10, 6, and 3.

Then, it says Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin. Hmm, okay. So, if Anakin caught 10 starfish, then Locsin caught 5 fewer. That would be 10 minus 5, which is 5. So, Locsin caught 5 starfish.

Next, it mentions that Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin. Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so subtracting 3 gives us 3. So, Locsin caught 3 sea horses.

Lastly, it says Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so adding 2 gives us 5. So, Locsin caught 5 clownfish.

Now, the question is asking how many fish they were able to catch in total. So, I need to add up all the fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.

Let me list out each category:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, Locsin caught 5. So, total starfish = 10 + 5 = 15.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, Locsin caught 3. So, total sea horses = 6 + 3 = 9.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, Locsin caught 5. So, total clownfish = 3 + 5 = 8.

Now, adding all these together: 15 starfish + 9 sea horses + 8 clownfish. Let me do the math.

15 + 9 is 24, and 24 + 8 is 32. So, together, they caught 32 fish.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Anakin: 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, 3 clownfish. That adds up to 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin: 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so 10 - 5 = 5. 3 fewer sea horses, so 6 - 3 = 3. 2 more clownfish, so 3 + 2 = 5. That adds up to 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Total fish caught: Anakin's 9 + Locsin's 13 = 22 fish. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
