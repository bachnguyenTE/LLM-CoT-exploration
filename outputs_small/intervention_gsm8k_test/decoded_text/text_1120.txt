Q: John visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John visiting his parents. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says John visits his parents twice a month, and it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. They want to know how many miles he drives in a month for the round trip. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. John is driving to visit his parents, and he does this twice a month. Each trip is a one-way trip, and the total time for each trip is 2 hours. But, that seems right. So, each time he goes to visit, it's a one-way trip, and then he comes back, making it a round trip. So, for each visit, he's driving to his parents and then back home. So, each visit is a round trip.

Wait, that seems right. So, if it takes him 2 hours one way, then a round trip would be 2 hours there and 2 hours back, totaling 4 hours per visit. But, that seems right. So, each time he visits, he's driving for 4 hours. But, that seems right. So, for each visit, he's driving 4 hours at 70 mph.

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I can calculate the distance for one way first, and then double it for the round trip. Let me think.

So, the formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. So, if he's driving at 70 mph for 2 hours one way, then the distance one way is 70 mph * 2 hours. Let me compute that. 70 times 2 is 140. So, each one-way trip is 140 miles. Therefore, a round trip would be 140 miles there plus 140 miles back, which is 280 miles. So, each time he visits, he drives 280 miles.

But, that seems right. So, if he does this twice a month, then the total miles he drives in a month would be 280 miles per visit multiplied by 2 visits. So, 280 * 2 is 560 miles. So, he drives 560 miles a month for the round trips.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. So, speed is 70 mph, time is 2 hours. So, distance one way is 70 * 2 = 140 miles. Wait, that seems right. 70 mph is 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, he would have driven 140 miles. So, that's correct.

Then, a round trip would be 140 miles each way, so 140 *2 = 280 miles. So, that's correct. So, each visit is 280 miles. He does this twice a month, so 280 *2 = 560 miles. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 560 miles per month.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 70 mph for 2 hours is 140 miles one way, which is 280 miles round trip. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
