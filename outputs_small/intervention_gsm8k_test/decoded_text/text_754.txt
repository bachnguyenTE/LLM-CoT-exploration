Q: Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?

Okay, so I have this problem where Lorraine is trading stickers for buttons, and I need to figure out how many buttons she has by the end. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the information given:

- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
- A small sticker is worth one small button.
- A large button is worth three small stickers.
- Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
- She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- She trades the rest of them for small buttons.
- We need to find the total number of buttons she has by the end.

Alright, let's start by understanding the value of each sticker and button. It might help to convert everything into the same unit, like small stickers, to make the calculations easier.

First, let's note the conversion rates:

1. Large sticker = 1 large button or 3 small stickers.
2. Small sticker =1 small button.
3. Large button =3 small stickers.

So, each large sticker is equivalent to either 1 large button or 3 small stickers. Similarly, each small sticker is just 1 small button.

Now, Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. Let me write that down:

- Small stickers: 30
- Large stickers: 40

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, let's calculate how many small stickers she trades.

90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30. Let me compute that:

0.9 * 30 = 27.

So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 large buttons in exchange.

Wait, that seems right. So, 27 small stickers become 27 large buttons.

Now, she also trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. She has 40 large stickers, so 50% of that is 0.5 * 40 = 20.

So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so each large sticker gives her 3 small stickers. Therefore, 20 large stickers would give her 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

So, she gets 60 small stickers in exchange for 20 large stickers.

Now, let's summarize the trade:

- Small stickers traded for large buttons: 27
- Large stickers traded for large buttons: 20
- Large stickers traded for small buttons: 40 - 20 = 20

So, she has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so 20 large stickers give her 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

So, now, let's track her remaining stickers and buttons.

Starting with:

- Small stickers: 30
- Large stickers: 40

After trading:

- She traded 27 small stickers for large buttons, so she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.
- She traded 20 large stickers for large buttons, so she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
- She traded 20 large stickers for small buttons, so she has 20 large stickers left and 60 small stickers from the trade.

Now, let's calculate the number of buttons she has.

First, the large buttons she has:

- 20 large stickers traded for large buttons, each worth 1 large button, so that's 27 large buttons from the first trade, and 20 large buttons from the second trade. So, total large buttons: 27 + 20 = 47.

Wait, that seems right. 27 from the first trade and 20 from the second trade, so 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

Now, the small buttons she has:

- 60 small stickers from the trade for small buttons.
- She still has 3 small stickers left from the initial trade.

So, total small buttons: 60 + 3 = 63.

Therefore, total buttons she has are 47 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. So, 47 large buttons and 63 small buttons.

But, that seems right. Let me just verify each step.

Starting with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
