Okay, so Tom is planning an anniversary trip for his wife, and he needs to figure out how much the trip will cost. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.

First, the plane tickets. Each ticket is $5000. Hmm, that seems really expensive, but, that seems right. So, Tom is buying two tickets for the plane, one for himself and one for his wife. So, that's 2 times $5000. Let me calculate that: 2 times 50000 is 110000. So, the plane tickets cost $11,0000 together? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 50000 times 2 is 110000. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it's a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. So, first, I need to figure out what the normal price is, which is $1500 per day. Then, the hotel is 20% more expensive. So, I need to calculate 20% of $1500 and add that to the normal price to get the total cost per day.

Let me compute 20% of $1500. To find 20% of a number, I can multiply the number by 0.22. So, 1500 times 0.22. Let me do that step by step. 1500 times 0.2 is 300, and 1500 times 0.02 is 31. So, adding those together, 300 plus 31 is 331. So, 20% of $1500 is $331. Therefore, the hotel is $1500 plus $331, which is $1831 per day.

Wait, that seems right. So, each day, the hotel costs $1831. But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 1500 times 0.2 is 300, so 1500 times 0.22 is 330. So, 1500 plus 330 is 1830. Yeah, that's correct. So, each day, the hotel is $1830.

Now, they are there for 3 days. So, the total cost for the hotel would be 3 times $1830. Let me calculate that. 1830 times 3. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 800 times 3 is 2400, and 30 times 3 is 90. So, adding those together: 3000 plus 2400 is 5400, plus 90 is 5490. So, the hotel costs $5490 for 3 days.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the trip. That includes the plane tickets and the hotel. So, the plane tickets are $11000, and the hotel is $5490. So, adding those together: 11000 plus 5490. Let me do that. 1000 plus 5000 is 6000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 11000 plus 5490. Let me add the thousands: 1000 plus 5000 is 6000, and 100 plus 490 is 590. So, 6600 plus 590 is 7200. Wait, that seems right. 11000 plus 5490 is 7200.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. 11000 plus 5490. 11100 + 5490. Let's add the units: 0 + 0 is 0. Tens: 0 + 9 is 9. Hundreds: 1 + 4 is 5. Thousands: 1 + 5 is 6. Ten thousands: 1 + 0 is 1. So, 16590. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
