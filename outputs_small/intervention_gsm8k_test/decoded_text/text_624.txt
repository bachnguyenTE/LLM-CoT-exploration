Q: Two sports coaches went shopping together. The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each. How much more did the basketball coach spend than the baseball coach?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate how much the baseball coach spent. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so I'll multiply 9 by 3 to find the total cost.

Next, I'll do the same for the basketball coach. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so I'll multiply 8 by 14 to find his total expenditure.

Finally, to determine how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach, I'll subtract the total amount the baseball coach spent from the total amount the basketball coach spent.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach:**
   
   - **Number of baseballs bought:** 9
   - **Cost per baseball:** \$3
   - **Total cost for baseballs:** \( 9 \times 3 = \$27 \)

2. **Calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach:**
   
   - **Number of basketballs bought:** 8
   - **Cost per basketball:** \$14
   - **Total cost for basketballs:** \( 8 \times 14 = \$112 \)

3. **Determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach:**
   
   - **Total spent by basketball coach:** \$112
   - **Total spent by baseball coach:** \$27
   - **Difference in spending:** \( 112 - 27 = \$85 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{85}
