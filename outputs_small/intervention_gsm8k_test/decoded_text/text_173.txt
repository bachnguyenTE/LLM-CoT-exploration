Q: Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the minimum payment Jessica is considering for each of her debts.

For her student loans, the minimum payment is $300/month. She wants to pay 50% more than this, so I'll calculate 55% of $300 and add it to the original amount.

For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200/month. Similarly, I'll calculate 55% of $200 and add it to the original amount.

For her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500/month. I'll calculate 55% of $500 and add it to the original amount.

Next, I'll sum up the increased minimum payments for all three debts to find the total amount she will pay each month.

Finally, to find out how much she will pay in a year, I'll multiply the total monthly payment by 12.

To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the increased minimum payment for each debt:**
   
   - **Student Loans:**
     \[
     \text{Increased Payment} = \$300 + (0.55 \times \$300) = \$300 + \$165 = \$465
     \]
   
   - **Credit Card:**
     \[
     \text{Increased Payment} = \$200 + (0.55 \times \$200) = \$200 + \$127.50 = \$327.50
     \]
   
   - **Mortgage:**
     \[
     \text{Increased Payment} = \$500 + (0.55 \times \$500) = \$500 + \$275 = \$775
     \]

2. **Sum the increased payments for the year:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Payment} = \$465 + \$327.50 + \$775 = \$1,567.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the annual payment:**
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Payment} = \$1,567.50 \times 12 = \$18,810
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$18,\!810}
\]
