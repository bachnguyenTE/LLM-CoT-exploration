Q: The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays, 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays and twice as many on Friday. How many chimichangas do they make on those three days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop making chimichangas on different days. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Hmm, okay, so that's two days accounted for. Then it mentions they make twice as many on Friday. So, I need to find out how many chimichangas they make on those three days: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Let me break it down. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 each. So, that's 125 on Tuesday plus 125 on Wednesday. I can write that as 125 + 125. Let me calculate that. 125 plus 125 is 250. So, together, on Tuesday and Wednesday, they make 250 chimichangas.

Now, on Friday, they make twice as many as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday. Since Tuesday and Wednesday each have 125, Friday must have 2 times 125. Let me compute that. 2 multiplied by 125 is 250. So, on Friday, they make 250 chimichangas.

Wait, that seems right. So, on Friday, they make 250, and on Tuesday and Wednesday, they make 250 each. So, adding all three days together: Tuesday (125) + Wednesday (125) + Friday (250). Let me add those up.

First, 125 + 125 is 250, as I had before. Then, adding Friday's 250 to that. So, 250 + 250. Hmm, 250 plus 250. Let me think. 250 plus 200 is 450, and then plus 50 is 450. So, 250 + 250 is 500. Wait, that seems right. So, altogether, they make 500 chimichangas on those three days.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Tuesday: 125, Wednesday: 125, Friday: 250. Adding them up: 125 + 125 is 250, plus 250 is 500. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 125 on Tuesday, 125 on Wednesday, so that's 250, and Friday is twice that, so 250. So, 250 + 250 is 500. Yep, same result.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is 500.

**Final Answer**
The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \boxed{500}.

The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Therefore, the number of chimichangas made on these two days is calculated as follows:

\[
125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 250
\]

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. Thus, the number of chimichangas made on Friday is:

\[
2 \times 125 = 250
\]

Adding the chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday:

\[
250 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500
\]

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \boxed{500}.
