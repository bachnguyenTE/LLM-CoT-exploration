Q: John packs M&M in small bags to eat.  He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each.  If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John packing M&M into small bags. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So each large bag is 10 ounces. So if he buys 3 of them, the total weight he has is 3 times 10 ounces. Let me write that down:

Total weight = 3 bags × 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces.

Wait, that seems right. 3 times 10 is 30, so 33 ounces? Wait, that seems right. 10 ounces is 10 ounces, so 3 times 10 is 33 ounces. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the next part says that an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M. So, each ounce contains 30 M&M. So, if he has 33 ounces, how many M&M does he have in total? I think I need to multiply the total ounces by the number of M&M per ounce.

Total M&M = 33 ounces × 30 M&M per ounce.

Wait, that seems right. So 33 times 30. Let me calculate that. 33 times 30. Hmm, 30 is 3 times 10, so 33 times 3 is 99, and then times 10 is 990. So, 33 × 30 = 990. So, he has 990 M&M in total.

Okay, now he wants to make small bags, each containing 10 M&M. So, how many small bags can he make? That should be the total number of M&M divided by the number per small bag.

Number of small bags = 990 M&M ÷ 10 M&M per bag.

Wait, that seems right. 990 divided by 10 is 99. So, he can make 99 small bags.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 3 large bags, each 10 ounces: 3 × 10 = 30 ounces. Wait, that seems right. 30 ounces total.

Then, each ounce has 30 M&M: 30 ounces × 30 M&M per ounce. Wait, that seems right. 30 × 30 is 900. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
