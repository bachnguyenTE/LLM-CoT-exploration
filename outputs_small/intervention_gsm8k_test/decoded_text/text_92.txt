Q: Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll identify the relationships between the ages of Emily's four kids.

Emily has four kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.

From the problem, we know:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
3. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.

I'll start by determining Corey's age. Since James is 10 and he is 1 year younger than Corey, Corey must be 11 + 1 = 12 years old.

Next, using the information that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy's age is 12 - 2 = 10 years old.

Finally, since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson's age is 10 - 5 = 7 years old.

Let's determine the ages of Emily's four kids step by step.

**Given:**
- Emily has four kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
- Relationships:
  1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
  2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
  3. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.

**Step 1: Find Corey's Age**

James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey's age is:
\[
\text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ years}
\]

**Step 2: Find Amy's Age**

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, Amy's age is:
\[
\text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \text{ years}
\]

**Step 3: Find Jackson's Age**

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, Jackson's age is:
\[
\text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \text{ years}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
