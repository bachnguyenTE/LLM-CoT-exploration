Q: Liam and Mitchell own competing lemonade stands across the street from one another. When Liam bragged that he had made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told Liam he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. How many more dollars did Mitchell make selling lemonade that weekend than Liam?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Liam and Mitchell selling lemonade. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that when Liam bragged and said he made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told him that he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. The question is asking how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam that weekend.

Alright, so I need to find the difference in their earnings. That means I need to calculate how much each of them made and then subtract Liam's amount from Mitchell's to see the difference.

Let me start with Mitchell. He sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, to find out how much he made, I need to multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade. That should give me his total earnings.

So, Mitchell's earnings = number of lemonades sold × price per lemonade.

Plugging in the numbers: 21 lemonades × $4 per lemonade.

Hmm, 21 times 4. Let me calculate that. 20 times 4 is 80, and 1 times 4 is 4, so 80 + 4 is 84. So, Mitchell made $84 that weekend.

Now, let's check Liam's earnings. The problem says he made $63. So, that's straightforward. Liam's earnings are already given as $63.

So, now I need to find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam. That means I subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings.

Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings.

So, Difference = $84 - $63.

Let me compute that. 84 minus 60 is 24, and then minus 3 more is 21. Wait, that seems right. 84 minus 63 is 21. So, the difference is $21.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Mitchell: 21 × 4. 20 ×4 is 80, 1×4 is 4, so 84. That's correct.

Liam: $63. So, 84 minus 63. 84 minus 60 is 24, then minus 3 is 21. So, yes, $21 difference.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. If Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, that's 21×4=84. Liam made $63. So, 84-63=21. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be $21.

**Final Answer**
The difference in their earnings is \boxed{21} dollars.
</think>

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so his earnings are calculated as follows:
\[
21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Liam made $63 that weekend. To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's:
\[
84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) dollars more than Liam that weekend.
