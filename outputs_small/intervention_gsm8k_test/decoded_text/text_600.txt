Q: Jamaal is at the gym. He has been using an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight that he uses by 50%. It turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jamaal and the weight he's using at the gym. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Jamaal is using an 8-pound weight. Hmm, okay, so initially, he's using 8 pounds. Then, he increases the weight by 50%. Hmm, increasing by 50%... I think that means he's going to add half of the original weight to it. So, 50% of 8 pounds. Let me calculate that. 

50% is the same as 0.5 in decimal form. So, 0.5 times 8 is... 4. So, 50% of 8 is 4 pounds. So, if he increases the weight by 50%, he adds 4 pounds to the original 8 pounds. That makes the new weight 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he goes from 8 to 12 pounds. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he increases it by 50%, so 8 + 4 is 12. pounds. 

But, that seems right. So, then, it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, he goes back down by 2 pounds from 12. So, 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. 

So, the final weight he uses is 10 pounds. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, starting at 8 pounds. He increases by 50%, so 8 * 1.5 is 12. Then, he uses two pounds less than that, so 12 - 2 is 10. Yeah, that seems correct. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 10 pounds. So, 10 pounds is the weight he now uses. 

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 50% increase on 8 is 4, so 12. Then, 2 pounds less is 10. Yeah, that's correct. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 10 pounds. So, 10 is the final weight. 

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 10 pounds. So, I think that's the answer.
