Okay, so Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. I need to figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that both Lisa and Peter sold a certain number of boxes, and each box has the same number of chocolate bars. Let me denote the number of chocolate bars in one box as \( x \). That makes sense because if I can find \( x \), I can find out how many chocolate bars are in each box.

So, Lisa sold three and a half boxes. That means she sold \( 3.5 \) boxes. Similarly, Peter sold four and a half boxes, which is \( 4.5 \) boxes. Since each box has \( x \) chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars Lisa sold would be \( 3.5 \times x \), and the total Peter sold would be \( 4.5 \times x \).

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. So, if I add Lisa's total and Peter's total, it should equal 64. Let me write that as an equation:

\( 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \)

Now, I can combine the terms on the left side. Adding \( 3.5x \) and \( 4.5x \) together gives:

\( (3.5 + 4.5)x = 64 \)

Calculating \( 3.5 + 4.5 \), that's 8. So, the equation simplifies to:

\( 8x = 64 \)

To find \( x \), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\( x = 64 / 8 \)

Calculating that, 64 divided by 8 is 8. So, \( x = 8 \). That means each box contains 8 chocolate bars.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so 3.5 times 8 is 28 chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so 4.5 times 8 is 36 chocolate bars. Adding those together, 28 plus 36 is indeed 64. Yep, that matches the total given in the problem. So, my answer must be correct.

I think that's it. So, each box has 8 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer**
The number of chocolate bars in a box is \boxed{8}.

Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to determine how many chocolate bars are in a box.

Let \( x \) be the number of of chocolate bars in one box. Lisa sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars, and Peter sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. This gives us the equation:

\[
3.5x + 4.5x = 64
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[
(3.5 + 4.5)x = 64
\]

Simplifying:

\[
8x = 64
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{64}{8} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\).
