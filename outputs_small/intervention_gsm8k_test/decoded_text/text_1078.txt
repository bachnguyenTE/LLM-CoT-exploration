Q: Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. Melanie’s mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?

Okay, so Melanie wants to make a toothpick sculpture and needs 200 toothpicks. She's saving them for her sandwiches, and her mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches every week. So far, she's saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Now, she wants to know how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks needed for the sculpture.

First, let me figure out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 each week for 12 weeks. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 10 by 12. Let me write that down:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks saved.

Okay, so she has 120 toothpicks saved. The total she needs is 200 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

200 total - 120 saved = 80 toothpicks needed.

Now, she's saving 10 toothpicks each week, same as her mom. So, to find out how many more weeks she needs to save, I can divide the remaining toothpicks by her weekly savings rate.

80 toothpicks needed / 10 toothpick/week = 8 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, she needs 8 more weeks to save the remaining 80 toothpicks.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

She saves 10 each week, 12 weeks: 10*12=120. Total needed is 200, so 200-120=80. 80 divided by 10 is 8. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as how many weeks at 10 per week will get her to 200. So, 200 divided by 10 is 20 weeks total. She's already saved 12 weeks, so 20-12=19 weeks.
