Q: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Seth and his stickers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

Alright, so the problem goes like this: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Then, Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. The question is, how many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?

Hmm, let me break this down. It might help to work backwards. Sometimes starting from the end can make things easier. So, let's see. At the end, Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. That means that before giving those 7 to Rob, Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. 

Wait, that seems right. So, before Kris gave 7 to Rob, he had 16. But, that seems right. So, before that, Luis gave the rest to Kris. So, let's think about that. 

Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the other half to Kris. So, if we let the number of stickers Luis received from Seth be X, then he used half of X, which is X/2, and gave the other half, also X/2, to Kris. So, that means Kris received X/2 from Luis. 

But, that seems right. So, the total number of stickers Kris had before giving any to Rob was X/2. Then, Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob, so X/2 = 16. So, X/2 =16, which means X=12. 

So, X is 12. That means Luis received 12 stickers from Seth. 

Wait, that seems right. So, Luis received 12 from Seth. So, how many stickers did Luis have? He received 12 from Seth, used half of them, so he used 6, and gave the other 6 to Kris. So, that's correct. 

So, now, going back to the beginning. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, if we let the number of stickers Seth had be Y, then he gave Y/2 to Luis. So, the number of stickers Luis had after receiving from Seth is Y/2. 

But, that seems right. So, Luis had Y/2 stickers after receiving from Seth. Then, Luis used half of them and gave the other half to Kris. So, he used half of Y/2, which is (Y/2)/2 = Y/4, and gave the other Y/4 to Kris. 

So, that means Kris received Y/4 from Luis. But, that seems right. So, the total number of stickers Kris had before giving any to Rob was Y/4. Then, Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob, so Y/4 =16. So, Y/4=16, which means Y=64. 

So, that would mean that Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, if Seth had 64 stickers, he gave half, which is 32, to Luis. Then, Luis had 32, used half, which is 16, and gave the other 16 to Kris. So, Kris had 16. Then, Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob. So, 9 +7=16, which matches. 

So, that seems to add up. So, the answer is 64. 

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by setting up equations. 

Let me denote the number of stickers Seth had as S. 

First, he gave half to Luis, so Luis received S/2. 

Then, Luis used half of his received stickers, so he used (S/2)/2 = S/4, and gave the other S/4 to Kris. 

So, Kris received S/4 from Luis. 

Then, Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob, so S/4 = 16, so S=64. 

So, that's the same result. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as working backwards. 

At the end, Kris had 16 stickers. So, before giving 7 to Rob, he had 16. So, before that, he had 16. 

So, before receiving from Luis, he had 16. So, the amount he received from Luis was 16. 

But, that seems right. So, the amount he received from Luis was 16, which was half of what he had
