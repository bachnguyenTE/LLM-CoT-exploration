Q: Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Soledad and her hiking trip. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Soledad works in a windowless office but, that seems right. She loves the outdoors, which is good because she's planning a big trip. She's going on vacation for the entire month of June, which is 30 days. She can't wait, that seems right. She wants to hike 9,300 miles in that month. Hmm, wait, that seems right. 9,300 miles? That's 9,300? Let me check. Yeah, 9,300 is 9 thousand three hundred and thirty miles. So, she wants to do that in June, which is 30 days. 

She's thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, I need to figure out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time. So, essentially, we need to find the required miles per day she needs to hike and then subtract her current plan to find the difference.

Let me break it down. First, let's find out how many miles she plans to hike in total. She wants to do 9,300 miles in June. So, that's 9,300 miles. 

Next, she's going to do this twice a day. So, each day, she's going to cover 125 miles twice. So, that's 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day. 

Wait, that seems right. So, each day, she's going to do 250 miles. So, over 30 days, that would be 250 * 30. Let me calculate that. 250 * 30 is 7,500 miles. Wait, that seems right. 250 * 30 is 7,500 miles. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
