Q: There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?

Okay, so I have this problem about Eddy's backyard with three trees. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. Then, the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest one. So, if the shortest is 6, adding 5 feet would make the second tree 11 feet tall. Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

Shortest tree: 6 feet.

Second tree: 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

Now, the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. Hmm, okay, so first I need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. That would be 6 + 11. Let me calculate that: 6 + 11 is 17 feet. So, the combined height is 17 feet.

Now, the tallest tree is twice that. So, 2 times 17. Let me do that multiplication: 2 * 17 is 34. So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall. Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my steps.

1. Shortest tree: 6 feet. That's given.

2. Second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest. So, 6 + 5 = 11 feet. That makes sense.

3. Then, the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. So, 6 +11 =17. Then, 2*17=34. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall. Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees. So, 2*(6+11)=2*17=34. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think the answer is 34 feet. So, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

**Final Answer**
The tallest tree is \boxed{34} feet tall.

The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet.
