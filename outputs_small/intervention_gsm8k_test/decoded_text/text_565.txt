Q: Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. The problem says he ate a third of the sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches in total, I can calculate a third of 12. To do that, I can divide 12 by 3. Wait, that seems right. So, 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches. Okay, that part is straightforward.

Next, I need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. The problem states he ate a quarter of the sandwiches. So, a quarter of 12. To calculate that, I can divide 12 by 4. Let me do that: 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches. Got that.

Now, I need to find out how many sandwiches were eaten in total by both Cody and Trevor. That would be the sum of the sandwiches they ate individually. So, that's 4 sandwiches (Cody) plus 3 sandwiches (Trevor). Let me add those together: 4 plus 3 is 7. So, together, they ate 7 sandwiches.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 12 sandwiches total. 1/3 is 4, 1/4 is 3. 4 plus 3 is 7. So, 12 minus 7 is 5. So, 5 sandwiches are left. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. If there are 12 sandwiches, and they ate 7, then 12 minus 7 is 5. So, 5 sandwiches are left. That makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to verify. Let me see. If I consider the fractions they ate, 1/3 and 1/4, maybe I can add those fractions together and subtract from 12.

So, 1/3 plus 1/4. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 3 and 4, so the least common denominator is 12. Wait, that seems right. 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4. So, converting both fractions to have denominator 12.

1/3 is equal to 2/6, and 1/4 is equal to 3/12. Wait, that seems right. So, 2/6 plus 3/6 is 5/6. So, together, they ate 5/6 of the sandwiches. So, 5/6 of 12 is 10/6, which is 1 and 2/3. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
