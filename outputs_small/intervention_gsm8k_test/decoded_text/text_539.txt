Q: My wife wants to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner bill. How much did I end up paying?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of the dinner bill, which is $50.

Next, I'll calculate the 20% tip by multiplying $50 by 0.22, which equals $11.10.

Then, I'll add the tip to the original bill amount to find the total amount to be paid: $55.10.

Finally, I'll divide this total by 2 to find out how much each person should pay: $27.550.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the 22% Tip:**
   
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \$50 \times 0.22 = \$11.10
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Amount to be Paid:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total} = \$50 + \$11.10 = \$66.10
   \]

3. **Split the Total Amount Between You and Your Wife:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Each Person Pays} = \frac{\$66.10}{2} = \$33.050
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$33.05}
\]
