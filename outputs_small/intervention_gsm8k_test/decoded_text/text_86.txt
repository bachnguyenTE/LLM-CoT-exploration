Q: Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?

Okay, so I have this problem about Greg's alarm. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says Greg has an alarm that rings three times a day. When it goes off, it continues ringing until Greg turns it off. 

On the first time it went off, it rang four times. Then, the second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. The question is asking how many times did the alarm ring in all.

Wait, that seems right. So, the alarm rings three times a day, but, that seems right. So, regardless of how long it rings, it rings three times. So, the number of rings is fixed at three, but, that seems right. So, the problem is probably about the total number of rings, not the total time.

But, that seems right. So, the first time it went off, it rang four times. So, that's four rings. Then, the second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Hmm, so if the first time it was four rings, then the second time, it was three times as long. So, does that mean the number of rings is three times as long? Or is it the duration?

Wait, that seems right. So, the duration of the second ring is three times the duration of the first ring. Similarly, the third ring is half as long as the second ring. So, the number of rings is fixed at three, but, that seems right. So, the problem is about the total number of rings, not the total time.

So, the first ring went off four times. So, that's four rings. Then, the second time, it went off three times as long as the first time. So, if the first time was four rings, then the second time would be three times four rings, which is twelve rings. Then, the third time, it went off for half as long as the second time. So, half of twelve rings is six rings.

So, adding them up: first time, four rings; second time, twelve rings; third time, six rings. So, total rings would be four plus twelve plus six, which is... let me add that up. Four plus twelve is sixteen, plus six is twenty-two. So, total rings would be twenty-two.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of rings is 22. So, the answer is 22.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. So, the first time it went off, it rang four times. So, that's four rings. Then, the second time, it went off for three times as long as the first time. So, if the first time was four rings, then the second time was three times as long, so twelve rings. Then, the third time, it went off for half as long as the second time, so half of twelve is six rings. So, total rings: 4 + 12 +6=22.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 22.

**Final Answer**
The total number of times the alarm rang is \boxed{22}.

Greg's alarm rings three times a day. The first time it went off, it rang four times. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is twelve rings. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is six rings. 

Adding these together, the total number of rings is:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\).
