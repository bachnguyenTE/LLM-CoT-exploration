Q: Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ophelia and Jenna living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Ophelia has 20 sofas, and I need to find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Ophelia has 20 sofas. So, Ophelia's number of sofas is 20. Now, it says they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, that means Jenna has 22 chairs? Wait, that seems right. Because 20 minus 2 is 22. So, Ophelia has 20 chairs? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, Ophelia has 20 chairs and 20 sofas. Then Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if Ophelia has 20 chairs, Jenna has 3 times that, which is 60 chairs. So, Jenna has 60 chairs and 66 minus 2 is 64? Wait, that seems right. So, Ophelia has 20 chairs and 22 chairs? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
