Q: James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. What percentage of James' teeth does the dentist fix?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of teeth that the dentist fixes. James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 of these teeth.

The dentist also caps 7 more teeth than the number of teeth drilled. So, the number of teeth capped is 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of teeth fixed by adding the number of teeth drilled and capped: 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

Finally, to find the percentage of teeth fixed, I'll divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100: (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

To determine the percentage of teeth fixed by the dentist, follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Teeth:**
   - James has **30 teeth** in total.

2. **Number of Teeth Drilled:**
   - The dentist drills **4 teeth**.

3. **Number of Teeth Capped:**
   - The dentist caps **7 more teeth** than the number of teeth drilled.
   - Number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = **11 teeth**.

4. **Total Number of Teeth Fixed:**
   - Total fixed teeth = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = **15 teeth**.

5. **Percentage of Teeth Fixed:**
   - Percentage = (Total fixed teeth / Total teeth) × 100
   - Percentage = (15 / 30) × 100 = 50%.

\boxed{50\%}
