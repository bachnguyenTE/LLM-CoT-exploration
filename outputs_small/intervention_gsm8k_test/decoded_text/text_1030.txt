Q: Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Okay, so Marcus is trying to figure out if he really needs to do his homework tomorrow. There are a few different probabilities involved here, and I need to figure out the chance that he will have to turn in his homework. Let me break this down step by step.

First, there's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher. If that happens, the homework won't be collected at all. So, if the substitute teacher comes in, Marcus definitely won't have to turn in his homework. That's straightforward.

But, that seems right. So, 50% chance of substitute teacher, which means 50% chance he doesn't have to do his homework. But, that seems right. So, 50% of the time, he won't have to do his homework.

Now, if the substitute teacher doesn't come in, which is 50% chance, then Marcus will have a normal teacher. Now, even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give him an extension. So, 40% chance of an extension. That means, if the teacher gives him an extension, he doesn't have to do his homework. But, that seems right. So, 40% chance of an extension, which means 56% chance he still has to do his homework.

Wait, that seems right. So, if the teacher gives him an extension, he doesn't have to do his homework. So, 40% chance of extension, 56% chance he has to do it.

But, that seems right. So, 56% chance he has to do his homework if the teacher gives him an extension.

But, that seems right. So, 56% chance he has to do his homework.
