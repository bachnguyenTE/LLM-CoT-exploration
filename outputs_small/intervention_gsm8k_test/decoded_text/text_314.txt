Okay, so I have this problem here about a football team with 105 members. It says there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Then it mentions there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. I need to find out how many players are on the defense. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The team has a total of 105 members. These members are divided into three categories: offense, defense, and special teams. The problem gives me relationships between the number of players in each category relative to the defense.

So, let's define some variables to represent the number of players in each position. Let me denote:

- Let D be the number of players on the defense.
- Then, the number of players on the offense is twice that, so 2D.
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so (1/2)D.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of players is the sum of the defense, offense, and special teams. So, D (defense) + 2D (offense) + (1/2)D (special teams) = 105.

Let me write that equation out:

D + 2D + (1/2)D = 105

Now, let me combine like terms. So, D + 2D is 3D, and then adding (1/2)D gives me 3D + 0.5D, which is 3.5D or 7/2 D.

So, 7/2 D = 105

To solve for D, I can multiply both sides by 2/7.

D = 105 * (2/7)

Let me compute that. 105 divided by 7 is 15, and 15 times 2 is 30.

So, D = 30.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my steps again.

1. Let D be defense players.
2. Offense is 2D.
3. Special teams are (1/2)D.
4. Total players: D + 2D + (1/2)D = 3.5D =105.
5. So, D =105 /3.5 =30.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

But, that seems right. Let me just verify by plugging back into the original numbers.

If defense is 30, then offense is 60, and special teams are 15. So, 30 +60 +15=105. Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, I think that's the answer. 30 players on the defense.

**Final Answer**
The number of players on the defense is \boxed{30}.
</think>

Let \( D \) be the number of players on the defense. According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice that of the defense, which is \( 2D \). The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, which is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7}{2}D = 105
\]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{7}\):

\[
D = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating this, we find:

\[
D = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\).
