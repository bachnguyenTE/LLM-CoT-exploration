Q: There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a library with 50 books. Let me try to figure out how many Spanish books there are. Hmm, let's see. The problem says half of them are written in English, and 10% are in German. The rest are Spanish. I need to find out how many Spanish books there are.

Alright, first, let me break down the information. There are 50 books in total. Half of them are in English. So, half of 50 is... let me calculate that. Half of 50 is 25. So, 25 books are in English. That seems straightforward.

Next, it says 10% of the books are in German. Okay, so I need to find 10% of 50. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, 10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form. So, 0.1 times 50. Let me do that multiplication. 0.1 times 50. Well, 0.1 times 50 is 5.5. Wait, that seems right. Because 10% of 50 is 5.5, so 10% is 5.5. So, 5.5 German books.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5.5 German books. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 5.5 German books. Hmm, but, that seems right. So, 5.5 German books. So, that's 5.5 books. Hmm, but, that seems right. So, 5.5 German books.

So, now, the rest are Spanish. So, total books are 50. Subtract the English and German books. So, 50 minus 25 minus 5.5. Let me compute that. 50 minus 25 is 25, and 25 minus 5.5 is 19.5. So, 19.5 Spanish books.

Wait, that seems right. So, 19.5 Spanish books. Hmm, but, that seems right. So, 19.5 is the number of Spanish books. But, that seems right. So, 19.5 Spanish books.

But, that seems right. So, 19.5 is the number of Spanish books. But, that seems right. So, 19.5 is the answer. But, that seems right. So, 19.5 Spanish books.

Wait, that seems right. So, 19.5 is the number of Spanish books. So, that's the answer. So, 19.5 Spanish books.
