Q: Mr Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. How many mosaic tiles would Mr Boarden need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom, and he needs to figure out how many mosaic tiles he'll require. The problem says that for every square foot, he needs 24 tiles. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me break it down step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, the bathroom is 36 square feet. That's given. Now, he wants to cover two-thirds of that bathroom with tiles. So, I need to find out what two-thirds of 36 square feet is. Once I have that, I can multiply by 24 to get the number of tiles needed.

Alright, so two-thirds of 36. Let me write that as a fraction: (2/3) * 36. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, 36 divided by 3 is 12, right? Because 3 times 12 is 36. So, 36 divided by 3 is 12. Then, 2 times 12 is 24. So, two-thirds of 36 square feet is 24 square feet. Wait, that seems right. Because if you take two-thirds of something, it's more than half, so 24 is more than half of 36, which is 3. So, 24 is correct.

Now, for each square foot, he needs 24 tiles. So, if he needs 24 square feet covered, he'll need 24 tiles per square foot. So, 24 square feet times 24 tiles per square foot. Let me write that as 24 * 24.

Hmm, 24 times 24. Let me calculate that. 24 times 20 is 48, and 24 times 4 is 96. Wait, that seems right. So, 24 times 20 is 480, and 24 times 4 is 96. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
