Q: A hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market. A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost. If Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, how much was the total cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ethan making his own hand-painted wallpaper. The market price is $400, and a DIY version saves him 20% after considering materials. I need to figure out how much Ethan actually paid for his own wallpaper. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the market price is $400, which is the original cost. The DIY version saves 20%, so that means Ethan is saving 20% on the original price. So, I need to calculate 20% of $400 and then subtract that from the original price to find out how much he paid for his own wallpaper.

Let me write that down step by step. The savings amount is 20% of $400. To calculate percentages, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So, I multiply 400 by 0.20.

Calculating that: 400 * 0.20. Let me do the multiplication. 400 times 0.2 is the same as 400 * 20 * 0.01, right? Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of 400 * 0.2 as 400 * 20 tenths, which is 400 * 2 tenths plus 400 * 0 tenths. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, I can just multiply 400 by 0.2. 400 * 0.2 is 80. Because 400 * 0.2 is 80, and 400 is 400, so 400 * 0.2 is 80. So, the savings is $80.

Therefore, Ethan paid the original price minus the savings. So, 400 minus 80 is 320. So, Ethan paid $320 for his own wallpaper.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If the original price is $400, and he saves 20%, then 20% of 400 is 80, so 400 - 80 is 320. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 100% of 400 is 400, so 20% is 80, so subtracting that gives 320. Yeah, that's consistent.

So, I think the answer is $320. But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, that seems right. 20% of 400 is 80, so 400 - 80 is 320. So, Ethan paid $320 for his own wallpaper.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to realize that the savings is 20% of the original price, which is $80, so subtracting that from get the total cost. So, the final answer is $320.

**Final Answer**
The total cost Ethan paid for his own wallpaper is \boxed{320}.

The market price of the wallpaper is $400. Ethan saves 20% on this price by making his own wallpaper. To find out how much he paid, we need to calculate 20% of $400 and subtract that from the original price.

First, we convert 20% to a decimal, which is 0.20. Then, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[
400 \times 0.20 = 80
\]

This means Ethan saved $80. Therefore, the total cost Ethan paid is:

\[
400 - 80 = 320
\]

The total cost Ethan paid for his own wallpaper is \boxed{320}.
