Q: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Okay, so Frederick is making popsicles and wants to save money by making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2x8 piece of wood. He has $24 to spend on wood. A 2x4 costs $4, and a 2x8 costs $6. The question is asking, what's the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out which type of wood is cheaper per stick. So, a 2x4 gives 220 sticks for $4, and a 2x8 gives 440 sticks for $6. Let me calculate the cost per stick for each.

For the 2x4: 220 sticks for $4. So, 220 divided by 4 is 55.55 dollars per stick. Wait, that seems right. 220 divided by 4 is 55.5 dollars per stick.

For the 2x8: 440 sticks for $6. So, 440 divided by 6 is 74 dollars per stick. That makes sense because 440 divided by 6 is 73.333, which is approximately 73.33 dollars per stick.

So, the 2x4 is cheaper per stick at $55.50 versus the 2x8 at $73.33. Therefore, to get the most popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy as many 2x4 pieces as possible.

He has $24 to spend. Each 2x4 costs $4, so how many can he buy? Let's divide 24 by 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, he can buy 6 pieces of 2x4 wood.

Each 2x4 gives 220 sticks, so 6 times 220 is 1320 sticks. That seems like a lot. But, that seems right. Let me check if he can buy more sticks by mixing 2x4 and 2x8.

Wait, that seems right. If he buys 2x8, each gives more sticks but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
