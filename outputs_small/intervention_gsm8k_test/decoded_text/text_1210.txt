Q: To kick off summer, Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends.  They fill up 10 packs of balloons that have 30 balloons per pack.  By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.  How many balloons did they throw?

Okay, so Jolene is having a water balloon fight with her friends during the summer. They start off by filling up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, each pack has 30 balloons, and they have 10 packs. I need to figure out how many balloons they have in total before any are left. 

Alright, so if each pack has 30 balloons and they have 10 packs, I can calculate the total number of balloons by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack. Let me write that down: 10 packs multiplied by 30 balloons per pack. Wait, that seems right. So, 10 times 30. Hmm, 10 times 30 is... let me think. 10 times 30 is 360. So, they have 360 balloons in total at the start.

But, that seems right. 10 packs times 30 balloons each is 360 balloons. Yeah, that makes sense. So, they start with 360 balloons. Then, by the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left. So, how many balloons did they throw? That would be the total number they had minus the number left, right?

So, 360 balloons minus 12 balloons left. Let me do that subtraction. 360 minus 12. Hmm, 360 minus 10 is 350, and then minus 2 more is 352. So, they threw 352 balloons.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. They started with 360 balloons, ended with 12 left, so 360 minus 12 is 352. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 352 balloons.

But, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 10 packs times 30 balloons each: 10 times 30 is 300, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10 times 30 is 300, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
