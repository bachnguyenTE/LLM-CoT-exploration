Q: On Monday the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. How many letters did the post office deliver Monday - Wednesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about the post office delivering letters over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I need to figure out how many letters they delivered from Monday to Wednesday. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that on Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. That seems straightforward. So, Monday's delivery is 425 letters.

Next, it mentions that on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. Hmm, okay. So, I need to calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries and then add 17 to that. Let me write that down.

One-fifth of Monday's letters is (1/5) * 425. Let me compute that. 425 divided by 5. Well, 400 divided by 5 is 80, and 25 divided by 5 is 5, so 80 + 5 is 85. So, one-fifth of 425 is 85. Then, adding 17 more, so 85 + 17. Let me do that: 85 + 10 is 96, and 7 more is 103. So, Tuesday's delivery is 103 letters.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. One-fifth of 425 is 85, plus 17 is 103. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, moving on to Wednesday. It says they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Okay, so first, I need to find twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries, and then add 5 to that.

So, twice Tuesday's letters is 2 * 103. Let me compute that: 2 * 100 is 200, and 2 *3 is 6, so 200 +6 is 206. Then, adding 5 more, so 206 +5 is 211. So, Wednesday's delivery is 211 letters.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. Twice 103 is 206, plus 5 is 211. Yep, that's correct.

So, now, I need to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday. That would be the sum of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday's deliveries.

So, Monday: 425, Tuesday: 103, Wednesday: 211.

Let me add them up step by step. First, add Monday and Tuesday: 425 + 103. Let me compute that. 425 + 100 is 525, and then +3 is 528. So, 425 +103 is 528.

Now, add Wednesday's 211 to that. So, 528 + 211. Let me break that down. 528 + 200 is 728, and then +11 is 739. So, 528 +211 is 739.

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 739.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Monday: 425 letters.

Tuesday: 1/5 of 425 is 85, plus 17 is 103. That's correct.

Wednesday: Twice 103 is 206, plus 5 is 211. Correct.

Adding them up: 425 +103 is 528, plus 211 is 739. Yep, that's correct.

So, I think 739 is the right answer.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using algebra or something else, just to confirm.

Alternatively, I can represent each day's delivery as variables and set up equations.

Let me denote:

Let M = number of letters on Monday = 425.

Let T = number of letters on Tuesday.

Let W = number of letters on Wednesday.

Given that T = (1/5)*M +17.

So, T = (1/5)*425 +17 = 85 +17 = 103. So, T=103.

Then, W = 2*T +5 = 2*103 +5 = 206 +5 = 211.

Then, total letters from Monday to Wednesday is M + T
