Q: A cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Calculate the average time the two take the eat the sausages.

Okay, so I have this problem here where a cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes, and a dog can eat the same number in two-thirds the time the cat takes. I need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how long it takes the dog to eat nine sausages. The problem says the dog can eat the same number in two-thirds the time the cat takes. The cat takes 30 minutes, so two-thirds of that would be... let me calculate that. Two-thirds of 30 minutes is (2/3) * 30. Hmm, 30 divided by 3 is 10, so 2 times 10 is 20. So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat nine sausages. Wait, that seems right. So, the dog is faster than the cat.

Now, I need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. Since average can mean different things, but, that seems right. I think it's the arithmetic mean, which is just adding both times and dividing by two. So, let me write that down.

The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 22 minutes. So, adding those together: 30 + 22 equals 52 minutes. Then, dividing by 2 to get the average: 52 divided by 2 is 26. So, the average time is 26 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. The cat is 30 minutes, the dog is 22 minutes. 30 plus 22 is 52, divided by 2 is 26. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. The cat is slower, so the dog is faster. So, the average should be somewhere between 22 and 30. 26 is indeed between them. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of rates. Let me try that approach to confirm.

The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. So, the rate of the cat is 9 sausages per 30 minutes, which simplifies to 3 sausages per 10 minutes. So, the cat's rate is 3/10 sausages per minute.

The dog eats nine sausages in two-thirds the time, which is 20 minutes. So, the dog's rate is 9 sausages per 20 minutes, which is 9/20 sausages per minute.

Wait, that seems right. So, the cat is eating at 3/10, and the dog is eating at 9/20. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, that seems right. 3/10 is 0.3, and 9/20 is 0.45. So, the dog is eating faster, which is consistent with the problem statement.

But, that seems right. So, if I wanted to find the time it takes for each to eat nine sausages, I can use the formula: time = number of sausages divided by rate.

So, for the cat, time is 9 divided by (3/10). That is 9 * (10/3) = 30 minutes. That's correct.

For the dog, time is 9 divided by (9/20). That is 9 * (20/9) = 20 minutes. That's also correct.

So, the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes 20 minutes. So, the average is (30 + 20)/2 = 52/2 = 26 minutes. So, that's consistent with my first calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of harmonic mean or something, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. The average time is the arithmetic mean, not the harmonic mean, because we are just averaging the two times.

Wait, that seems right. The harmonic mean is used when dealing with rates, like speed, but, that seems right. So, in this case, since we are just averaging the times, it's the arithmetic mean.

So, 30 and 20, average is 26. So, that's the answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how much each can eat in a certain amount of time and see how it averages out.

But, that seems right. So, the cat eats 9 sausages in 30
