Q: Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.

Okay, so I have this problem about Ariadne's shop selling red and green hats. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that in the first month, her sales from red hats were $400. It also mentions that this amount was half the total from green hats. Hmm, so if red hats made $400, then green hats must have made double that, right? Let me write that down.

Red hats: $400  
Green hats: ?

Since red hats are half of green hats, that means green hats are twice as much as red hats. So, green hats = 2 * red hats = 2 * 400 = $800.

Wait, that seems right. So in the first month, she made $400 on red hats and $800 on green hats. Let me check: 400 is half of 800, yes, because 800 divided by 2 is 400. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem asks for the total amount she made in two months. It also mentions that in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total for the second month based on the first month's total.

First, let me find the total sales for the first month. That would be red hats plus green hats. So, 400 + 800. Let me add those: 400 + 800 is 1200. So, first month total is $1200.

Now, in the second month, her sales were 3/4 of that total. So, I need to calculate 3/4 of 1200. Let me do that. 1200 divided by 4 is 300, and 300 multiplied by 3 is 900. So, the second month's total is $900.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 3/4 of 1200. 1200 divided by 4 is 300, so 300 times 3 is 900. Yep, that's correct.

So, now, to find the total amount she made in two months, I need to add the first month's total and the second month's total. That would be 1200 + 900. Let me add those: 1200 + 900 is 2100. So, the total amount she made in two months is $2100.

Wait, that seems right. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First month: red 400, green 800, total 1200. Second month: 3/4 of 1200 is 900. Total over two months: 1200 + 900 = 2100. Yeah, that all adds up.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was understanding that the second month's sales were a portion of the first month's total, not the total of both months. So, I had to calculate the first month's total, then find 3/4 of that, and then add both totals together.

So, yeah, the final answer should be $2100.

**Final Answer**
The total amount Ariadne made in two months is \boxed{2100}.

First, we know that in the first month, the sales from red hats were $400, which was half of the total sales from green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were:

\[
\text{Green hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800
\]

The total sales for the first month are the sum of red and green hat sales:

\[
\text{Total for first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200
\]

In the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales for the second month are:

\[
\text{Second month sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
\]

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is the sum of the first month's total and the second month's total:

\[
\text{Total for two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100
\]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100
