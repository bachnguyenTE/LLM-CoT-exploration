Q: In Tate’s garden pond, there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes.  He buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.  How many more female fishes than male fishes does Tate have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfish in Tate's pond.

There are 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. After buying, the number of male guppies becomes 4 + 2 = 6, and the number of female guppies becomes 7 + 1 = 8.

For the goldfishes, there are 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes. After purchasing, the number of male goldfishes becomes 3 + 2 = 5, and the number of female goldfishes becomes 5 + 3 = 8.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of male and female fishes.

The total number of male fishes is 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11.

The total number of female fishes is 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16.

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes there are than male fishes, I'll subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes: 16 - 11 = 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more female fishes there are than male fishes in Tate's pond after he buys the additional fish.

### **Initial Counts**
- **Male Guppies:** 4
- **Female Guppies:** 7
- **Male Goldfishes:** 3
- **Female Goldfishes:** 5

### **After Buying More Fish**
- **Male Guppies:** 4 + 2 = **6**
- **Female Guppies:** 7 + 1 = **8**
- **Male Goldfishes:** 3 + 2 = **5**
- **Female Goldfishes:** 5 + 3 = **8**

### **Total Counts**
- **Total Male Fishes:** 6 (Guppies) + 5 (Goldfishes) = **11**
- **Total Female Fishes:** 8 (Guppies) + 8 (Goldfishes) = **16**

### **Difference**
- **Female Fishes - Male Fishes:** 16 - 11 = **5**

\boxed{5}
