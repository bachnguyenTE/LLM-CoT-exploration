Q: Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having twice as many instructions as the first one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two dishes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Kelian has two recipes for dishes. The first recipe has 20 instructions, and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first. I need to figure out how many instructions Kelian has to read in total to prepare both dishes. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Kelian has two recipes. The first one is simpler, with 20 instructions. The second one is more complicated, and it has twice as many instructions as the first. So, I need to find the total number of instructions she has to read if she wants to prepare both dishes.

Alright, so let's parse this out. The first recipe has 20 instructions. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 is the number of instructions for the first recipe. Then, the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first. So, if the first is 20, the second should be 2 times 20. Let me write that down.

First recipe instructions: 20.

Second recipe instructions: 2 * 20.

So, I need to calculate 2 * 20. Hmm, 2 times 20. Let me compute that. 20 is the same as 20, so 2 times 20 is 40. So, the second recipe has 40 instructions.

Now, to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, I need to add the instructions from both recipes together. So, that would be 20 (from the first recipe) plus 40 (from the second recipe). Let me add those numbers.

20 + 40. Hmm, 20 plus 40. 20 plus 40 is 60. Wait, that seems right. 20 plus 40 is 60? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
