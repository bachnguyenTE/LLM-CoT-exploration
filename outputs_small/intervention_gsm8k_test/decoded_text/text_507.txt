Q: Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. If each bus trip costs her $2.20, how much would she save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total cost of buying five bus trips without the weekly pass. Since each trip costs $2.20, the total cost is 5 multiplied by $2.20, which equals $11.00.

Next, compare this total cost to the weekly bus pass price of $20.00. Subtract the weekly pass cost from the total cost of five individual trips to find the savings: $11.00 minus $2.00 equals $9.00.

Therefore, Janet would save $9.00 by purchasing the weekly bus pass.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of five bus trips without the weekly pass:**

   Each bus trip costs \$2.20.

   \[
   \text{Total cost without pass} = 5 \times \$2.20 = \$11.00
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:**

   The weekly bus pass costs \$20.00.

3. **Calculate the savings by purchasing the weekly bus pass:**

   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost without pass} - \text{Cost of weekly pass} = \$11.00 - \$2.00 = \$9.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$9.0}
\]
