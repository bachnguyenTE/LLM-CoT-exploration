Q: It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. He reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep. How long does James spend reading, in minutes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before he goes to bed. Then he reads 18 pages and decides to go to sleep. The question is asking how long James spends reading, in minutes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the rate at which James reads. The problem says he takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages. Wait, that seems right. So, 3 pages in 10 minutes. Hmm, actually, 10 minutes is the time before he goes to bed, but, that seems right. So, maybe the 10 minutes is the time it takes him to read 3 pages before he goes to bed. So, he's reading before he goes to bed, and then he reads 18 pages and goes to sleep. So, the total time he spends reading is the time he spends reading 3 pages plus the time he spends reading 18 pages.

Wait, that seems right. So, first, he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, and then he reads 18 pages. So, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, and then add that to the initial 10 minutes.

So, let me think about this. If he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then his reading rate is 3 pages per 10 minutes. So, to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion.

So, 3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes.

So, cross-multiplying, we get 3x = 18 * 10, which is 180. So, 3x = 180. Then, x = 180 / 3, which is 60. So, x is 60 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, if he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, then 18 pages would take 60 minutes. So, the total time he spends reading is 10 minutes plus 60 minutes, which is 70 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10 minutes for the first 3 pages, and then 60 minutes for the next 18 pages, so total of 70 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as pages per minute. So, 3 pages in 10 minutes is 3/10 pages per minute. So, to find the time to read 18 pages, we can take 18 divided by (3/10). So, 18 / (3/10) is 18 * (10/3) which is 240/3, which is 80 minutes. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
