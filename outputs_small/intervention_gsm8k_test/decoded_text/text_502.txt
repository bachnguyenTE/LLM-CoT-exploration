Q: Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts for themselves. Cherrie goes ahead and buys them and decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts. How many gifts did Cherrie buy in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many Christmas gifts Cherrie bought in total. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Cherrie wants to buy gifts for her 5 friends. Out of these 5 friends, 2 of them want 5 gifts each, and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts each for themselves. So, let me calculate how many gifts that is in total.

For the first group of friends: 2 friends × 5 gifts each = 10 gifts.

For the second group of friends: 3 friends × 2 gifts each = 6 gifts.

So, adding those together, 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. That's the number of gifts she initially planned to buy.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2 friends wanting 5 each is 10, and 3 friends wanting 2 each is 6, so 16 total. So, 16 +10=16. Yeah, that seems correct.

Then, the problem says that Cherrie goes ahead and buys them and decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts. So, she buys 10 more gifts.

So, to find the total number of gifts, I need to add those 10 to the initial 16.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16 +10=26.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16 initial gifts plus 10 more is 26 total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

First group: 2 friends ×5=10.

Second group:3 friends ×2=6.

Total initial gifts:10+6=16.

Then, 10 more gifts.

Total gifts:16+10=26.

Wait, that seems right. So, 26 total.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 26.

Wait, that seems right. So, 26 is the total number of gifts.
