Q: Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Eliza's earnings for the week. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week. That means if she works 40 hours, she gets $10 each hour. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, for the first 40 hours, she gets $10 each hour. Then, for any hours beyond 40, she gets overtime pay, which is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. 

So, Eliza worked 45 hours this week. That's more than 40, so she has both regular hours and overtime. Let me break it down. 

First, calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours. That would be 40 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. Let me write that down: 40 * 10. Hmm, 40 times 10 is 440. So, she earns $440 for the first 40 hours. 

Then, she worked 45 hours, which is 1 hour overtime. So, the overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate. Her regular rate is $10, so overtime is 1.2 * 10. Let me calculate that: 1.2 * 10 is $12. So, for the 1 overtime hour, she gets $12. 

Now, to find her total earnings for the week, I need to add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime. That would be $440 plus $12. Let me add those together: 440 + 12 is 452. 

So, Eliza earned $452 for the week. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400. 

Overtime hours: 45 - 40 = 1 hour. 

Overtime pay: 1 hour * (1.2 * $10/hour) = 1 * $12/hour = $2. 

Total earnings: $400 + $2 = $402.
