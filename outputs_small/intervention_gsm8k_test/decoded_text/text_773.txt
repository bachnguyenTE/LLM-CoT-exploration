Q: Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, and he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. He kept the remaining pencils. How many pencils did Anthony keep?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Anthony and his pencils. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Anthony had 50 pencils. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So he starts with 50 pencils. Then, he gave half of his pencils to Brandon. Okay, so I need to calculate half of 50. Let me write that down.

So, half of 50 pencils is 50 divided by 2. Let me do the division: 50 ÷ 2. Hmm, 2 goes into 5 two times with a remainder of 1. Then, bring down the 0, making it 10. 2 goes into 10 five times. So, 50 divided by 2 is 27.5. Wait, that seems right. So, he gave 27.5 pencils to Brandon. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he gave 27.5 pencils to Brandon. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
