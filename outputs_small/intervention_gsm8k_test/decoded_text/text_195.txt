Okay, so I have this problem here: A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much will 8 pens cost? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. It says a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, if I let the cost of a pen be P, then P equals the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser. Got that. So, P = pencil + eraser.

They also give me the costs of a pencil and an eraser. A pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30. So, substituting those values in, P = 1.20 + 0.30. Let me calculate that. 1.20 plus 0.30 is... 1.50. So, each pen costs $1.50. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, the question is asking how much 8 pens will cost. So, if each pen is $1.50, then 8 pens would cost 8 times that amount. Let me write that down: Total cost = 8 * P. Since P is $1.50, then Total cost = 8 * 1.50.

Hmm, let me compute that. 8 times 1.50. Let me break it down. 8 times 1 is 8, and 8 times 0.50 is 4. So, adding those together, 8 + 4 is 12. So, 8 * 1.50 is $12.00. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can think of 1.50 as 150 cents. So, 8 pens would be 8 * 150 cents. Let me compute that. 8 * 150 is 1200 cents, which is $12.00. Yep, that matches. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, each pen is $1.50, so 8 pens would be 8 * 1.50. Let me do the multiplication again just to be sure. 1.50 times 8. 1.50 * 8: 1 *8 is 8, 0.50 *8 is 4.00, so 8 + 4 is 12. So, 12.00. So, $12.000. So, 8 pens would cost $12.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions or something else? Hmm, no, I think the way I did it is straightforward. Since each pen is equal to the sum of a pencil and an eraser, and I know the individual prices, I can just add them up and multiply by the number of pens.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as an equation. Let me define variables:

Let P = cost of a pen.

Let E = cost of an eraser.

Let B = cost of a pencil.

Given that P = B + E.

Given that B = $1.20, E = $0.30.

So, P = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50.

Therefore, each pen is $1.50.

Then, 8 pens would be 8 * 1.50.

Which is 12.00.

So, that's $12.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's any chance I misread the problem. It says a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, P = B + E. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it had said something like a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser each, that would be different, but, that seems right. So, P = B + E.

So, I think my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of money. If a pencil is $1.20, and an eraser is $0.30, then together they are $1.50. So, a pen is $1.50. So, 8 pens would be 8 times that, which is $12.00.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 8 * (1.20 + 0.30) = 8 * 1.50 = 12.0
