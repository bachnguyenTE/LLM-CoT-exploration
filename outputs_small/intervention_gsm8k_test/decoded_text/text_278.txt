Q: Mico and Marco wanted to get to know each other. They realized that the sum of their ages is 20. What will be the sum of their ages in 10 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mico and Marco want to figure out how old they both will be in 10 years. They know that right now, their combined ages add up to 20. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. The sum of their current ages is 20. So, if I let Mico's current age be M and Marco's current age be N, then I can write the equation:

M + N = 20

Now, the question is asking about the sum of their ages in 10 years. That means we need to find out how much their ages will increase over those 10 years and add that to the current total.

In 10 years, Mico will be M + 10 years old, and Marco will be N + 10 years old. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

(M + 10) + (N + 10)

Let me simplify that expression. Combining like terms, that would be:

M + N + 10 + 10

Which simplifies to:

M + N + 22

Wait, that seems right. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum plus 22. Since we know that M + N is 20, we can substitute that in:

20 + 22 = 42

So, in 10 years, their combined ages will be 42. That makes sense because each of them will gain 10 years, so together they gain 22 years. Adding that to their current total of 20 gives 42.

Let me just double-check my reasoning. If right now they are 20 years old together, and each will be 10 years older in 10 years, then 10 years added to each of their ages is 22 years added to their combined ages. So, 20 +22 is indeed 42. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that the 10 years added to both of their ages, so the total increase is 22 years, which is added to the current total of get the future total. So, 20 +22 is 42. That seems solid.

**Final Answer**
The sum of their ages in 10 years will be \boxed{42}.

Mico and Marco realized that the sum of their ages is 20. Let Mico's current age be \( M \) and Marco's current age be \( N \). We can write the equation:

\[ M + N = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico will be \( M + 10 \) years old and Marco will be \( N + 10 \) years old. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (N + 10) \]

Simplifying this expression:

\[ M + N + 10 + 10 \]
\[ M + N + 20 \]

Since \( M + N = 20 \), we substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Wait, that seems right. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Wait, that seems right. So, in 10 years, their combined ages will be 40. That makes sense because each of them will be 10 years older, so together they gain 20 years. Adding that to their current total of 20 gives 42.

Wait, that seems right. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the correct final answer is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]
