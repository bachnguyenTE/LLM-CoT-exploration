A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Raphael spent on school supplies. Let me break this down step by step. First, he bought pens, notebooks, and a bond paper. I'll calculate each item separately and then add them up.

Starting with the pens. He bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. Hmm, so I need to multiply the number of pens by the cost per pen. Let me write that down: 4 pens * $1.5 per pen. Let me do the multiplication. 4 times 1 is 4, and 4 times 0.5 is 2. So, 4 + 2 is $6. So, the pens cost $6 in total.

Next, the notebooks. He bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4. So, that's 2 * $4. Let me calculate that. 2 times 4 is 8. So, the notebooks cost $8 altogether.

Then, there's the bond paper, which costs $20. Wait, that seems right. $20 is the same as $20. So, that's straightforward.

Now, I need to add up all these amounts: pens, notebooks, and the bond paper. So, $6 for pens, $8 for notebooks, and $20 for the bond paper. Let me add them step by step.

First, add the pens and notebooks: $6 + $8. That should be $14. Then, add the bond paper: $14 + $20. Hmm, 14 plus 20 is 34. So, the total amount spent is $34.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 4 pens at $1.5 each: 4 * 1.5. 1.5 is the same as 1 dollar and 50 cents. So, 4 * 1 is 4, and 4 * 0.5 is 2. So, 4 + 2 is 6. That's correct.

Then, 2 notebooks at $4 each: 2 * 4 is 8. That's correct.

Bond paper is $20, so adding 6 + 8 is 14, plus 20 is 34. Yeah, that adds up.

So, I think I did that right. So, the total amount Raphael spent is $34.

**Final Answer**
Raphael spent a total of \boxed{34} dollars on everything.

Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each. The cost for the pens is calculated as:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

He also bought 2 notebooks at $4 each. The cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The bond paper cost $20. 

Adding up all the costs:
\[ 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
