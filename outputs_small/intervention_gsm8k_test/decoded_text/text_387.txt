Q: An eraser costs $2 and a pencil costs $3. How much do 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of 6 erasers. Since each eraser costs $2, multiplying 6 by $2 gives the total cost for the erasers.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of 8 pencils. Each pencil costs $3, so multiplying 8 by $3 will give the total cost for the pencils.

Finally, I'll add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils to find the overall total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

**Solution:**

We need to find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, where:
- Each eraser costs \$2.
- Each pencil costs \$3.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of 6 erasers.**

\[
\text{Cost of 6 erasers} = 6 \times \$2 = \$12
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 pencils.**

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pencils} = 8 \times \$3 = \$24
\]

**Step 3: Find the total cost by adding the two amounts together.**

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$12 + \$24 = \$36
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$36}
\]
