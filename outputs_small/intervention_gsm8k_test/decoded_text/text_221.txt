Q: A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a water tank and Celine using some water for her garden. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the tank is filled with 120 liters of water. That's the starting point. Then, Celine uses 90 liters to water her small garden. Hmm, so I need to subtract that from the total to find out how much is left in the tank. 

Let me write that down: 120 liters minus 90 liters. Hmm, 120 minus 90. Let me do the subtraction. 120 minus 90 is... 31 liters? Wait, that seems right. Because 90 plus 33 is 132, which is more than 120. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
