Q: In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this quiz problem here, and I need to figure out how many points Aries is sure to get. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The quiz has 60 items. Hmm, wait, that seems right. 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. So, first, I need to figure out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are.

Alright, 40% of 60 questions are easy. Let me calculate that. 40% is the same as 0.4 in decimal. So, 0.4 multiplied by 60. Let me do that: 0.4 * 60. Hmm, 0.4 times 60. Well, 0.4 times 60 is the same as 0.4 * 60. Let me compute that. 0.4 * 60. 0.4 times 60 is 24. because 0.4 * 60 is 24. So, there are 24 easy questions.

Now, the rest of the questions are average and difficult. The rest would be 60 minus 24, which is 36. So, 36 questions are average and difficult. The problem says they are equally divided as average and difficult. So, that means half of them are average and half are difficult.

So, 36 divided by 2 is 18. So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Alright, now Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. So, she gets 75% of the easy ones right. Let me calculate how many that is. 75% of 24 is... 0.75 * 24. Let me compute that. 0.75 * 24. 0.75 is three-fourths, so three-fourths of 24 is 18. So, Aries gets 18 easy questions right.

Next, she gets half of the average and difficult questions correct. So, half of 18 is 9. So, she gets 9 average questions right and 9 difficult questions right.

So, adding up all the correct answers: 18 easy + 9 average + 9 difficult. Let me add those up. 18 + 9 is 17, and 17 + 9 is 16. So, Aries is sure to get 16 points.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 40% of 60 is 24 easy. 60 - 24 is 36, which is split equally into average and difficult, so 18 each. 75% of 24 is 18. 50% of 18 is 9. So, 18 + 9 +9 is 16. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 16.

**Final Answer**
Aries is sure to get \boxed{16} points.

The quiz has 60 questions. 40% of the questions are easy, and the remaining 60% are equally divided between average and difficult questions.

1. Calculate the number of easy questions:
   \[
   0.4 \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 easy questions.

2. Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   Since the remaining 36 questions are equally divided, we have:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]
   So, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

3. Calculate the number of correct answers for each category:
   - Easy questions: 75% of 24
     \[
     0.75 \times 24 = 18
     \]
   - Average questions: Half of 18
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   - Difficult questions: Half of 18
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]

4. Add up all the correct answers:
   \[
   18 + 9 + 9 = 16
   \]

Thus, Aries is sure to get \boxed{16} points.
