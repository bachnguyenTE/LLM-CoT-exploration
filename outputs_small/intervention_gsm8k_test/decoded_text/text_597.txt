Q: The three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. What is the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, in degrees?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a triangle where the three angles add up to 180 degrees. Hmm, wait, that seems right. I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. So, that's a good starting point.

Now, the problem says that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle. I need to find the measure of the largest angle. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, let me denote the smallest angle as, let's say, x degrees. That makes sense because we're talking about the smallest angle, so x should be the smallest. Then, according to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest, so that would be 2x. And another angle is three times the smallest, so that's 3x.

Wait, that seems right. So, we have three angles: x, 2x, and 3x. Since it's a triangle, the sum of these angles should be 180 degrees. So, I can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Let me compute that. x + 2x is 3x, and 3x + 3x is 6x. So, 6x = 180. To find x, I can divide both sides by 6.

So, x = 180 / 6. Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 6. 6 goes into 18 three times, so 3, and then 6 goes into 0 zero times, so 30. So, x is 30 degrees.

Wait, that seems right. So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Then, the other angles are 2x and 3x. So, 2x is 60 degrees, and 3x is 90 degrees.

So, the three angles are 30, 60, and 90 degrees. Let me check if they add up to 180. 30 + 60 is 90, and 90 + 90 is 180. Wait, that seems right. 30 + 60 + 90 is 180. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 30 + 60 is 90, plus 90 is 180. Yeah, that adds up.

But, that seems right. So, the angles are 30, 60, and 90 degrees. So, the largest angle is 90 degrees. So, the answer is 90 degrees.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

So, starting again: the three angles are x, 2x, and 3x. So, x + 2x + 3x = 6x = 180. So, x = 30. Then, 2x is 60, and 3x is 90. So, the angles are 30, 60, 90. So, the largest angle is 90 degrees.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 degrees.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.
