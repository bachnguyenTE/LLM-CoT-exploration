Q: If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "If every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, how many jellyfish would 5 springs working at the same rate create in 4 hours?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says that every second, one bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish. So, if I have one spring, it makes one jellyfish per second. Now, the question is, if I have five of these springs working at the same rate, how many jellyfish would they create in four hours?

Alright, so I need to calculate the total number of jellyfish created by five springs over four hours. Let me break this down.

First, let's figure out how many seconds are in four hours because the rate is given per second. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So, 60 minutes times 60 seconds per minute. Wait, that seems right. Let me write that out:

1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 seconds

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that. 60 minutes times 60 seconds. Hmm, 60 times 60. Let me compute 60 * 60. 60 times 60 is 3600. So, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 4 hours would be 4 times 3600 seconds.

So, 4 * 3600. Let me compute that. 3600 * 4. 3000 * 4 is 12000, and 600 * 4 is 2400. So, 12000 + 2400 is 14400. So, 4 hours is 14400 seconds.

So, each spring creates one jellyfish every second. So, if I have five springs, each creating one jellyfish per second, then in one second, how many jellyfish are created? It should be 5, right? Because each spring is independent and creating one jellyfish.

Therefore, in one second, 5 jellyfish are created. So, over 14 hours, which is 14400 seconds, the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 multiplied by 14400.

So, 5 * 14400. Let me compute that. 5 times 10000 is 50000, and 5 times 4400 is 22000. So, 50000 + 22000 is 72000. So, 5 * 14400 is 72000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 springs working at the same rate, each creating one jellyfish per second, over 4 hours, which is 14400 seconds, would create 72000 jellyfish.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. 4 hours is 4 * 3600. 4 * 3000 is 12000, and 4 * 600 is 2400. So, 12000 + 2400 is 14400. That's correct.

Then, 5 springs each creating one jellyfish per second. So, 5 * 14400. 5 * 10000 is 50000, 5 * 4000 is 20000. So, 50000 + 20000 is 72000. So, 72000 jellyfish.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 springs, each creating one jellyfish per second, over 4 hours, which is 14400 seconds, so 5 * 14400 is 72000.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 5 * 60 * 60 * 4. Let me compute that.

60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour, 4 hours. So, 60 * 60 * 4. Let me compute 60 * 60 first. 60 * 60 is 3960. Then, 3960 * 4. 3
