Q: A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?

Okay, so I have this problem here: A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. There's a house and a lot together, and together they cost $120,000. Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost is $120,000. Now, the house costs three times as much as the lot. So, the house is more expensive than the lot, and the house's cost is three times the lot's cost.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me call the cost of the lot "L" and the cost of the house "H". So, according to the problem, H = 3L. That makes sense because the house is three times as expensive as the lot.

Now, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, that would be H + L = 120,000. Since I already have H in terms of L, I can substitute that into the equation. So, replacing H with 3L, the equation becomes 3L + L = 120,000.

Let me write that down: 3L + L = 120,000. Combining like terms, that's 4L = 120,000. So, to find the value of L, I need to divide both sides by 4. So, L = 120,000 / 4.

Let me calculate that. 120,000 divided by 4. Hmm, 120 divided by 4 is 30, so 120,000 divided by 4 should be 30,000. So, L = 30,000. That means the lot costs $30,000.

But, that seems right. Let me check. If the lot is $30,000, then the house is three times that, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000. So, the house is $90,000 and the lot is $30,000. Adding them together, 90,000 + 30,000 = 120,000. That matches the total cost given in the problem. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the house cost $90,000. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 3 times 30,000 is 90,000, and 90,000 plus 30,000 is 120,000. Yep, that adds up. So, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If the total is 120,000 and the house is three times the lot, then the total can be thought of as 4 parts, where 3 parts are the house and 1 part is the lot. So, each part is 120,000 divided by 4, which is 30,000. So, each part is $30,000, so the house is 3 parts, which is 90,000. That also makes sense.

So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is $90,000 for the house. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Just to recap, the problem is about splitting a total cost between a house and a lot where the house is three times as expensive as the lot. By setting up the equation with variables, substituting, and solving, I arrived at the conclusion that the house cost $90,000. The check confirms that the numbers add up correctly, so I'm confident that's the right answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to set up the equation correctly, using the given ratio, and then solve for the unknown. It's a straightforward algebra problem once you set it up properly. I just need to make sure I didn't misread the total cost or the ratio. The total was $120,000, and the ratio was 3:1 for house to lot. So, that all lines up.

Another way to think about it is, if the house was the same as the lot, the total would be 2 parts, but, that
