Q: Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many groups can perform at Vicki's pop concert. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the concert is 2 hours long. Hmm, I should convert that into minutes because the other time units are in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours would be 120 minutes. Got that down.

Now, each group needs to perform, but, that seems right. Let me check: each group gets 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit. So, that's 2 + 6 + 2. Let me add those up: 2 + 6 is 8, plus 2 is 10. So each group takes 10 minutes in total.

Wait, that seems right. 2 minutes on stage, 6 minutes performing, and 2 minutes off-stage. So, 10 minutes per group.

Then, there's a 10-minute intermission. So, that's a break between groups. So, the total time per group is 10 minutes, and then 10 minutes for the intermission.

Wait, that seems right. So, each group is 10 minutes, and then 10 minutes between them. So, the total time per group including the intermission is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, each group takes 10 minutes, and then 10 minutes for the intermission. So, each group and the intermission together take 20 minutes.

But, that seems right. So, if each group takes 20 minutes, how many groups can fit into 120 minutes?

So, let me calculate that. 120 divided by 20. Let me do that: 120 ÷ 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 120 six times because 20 times 6 is 120. So, that would be 6 groups.

Wait, that seems right. So, 6 groups can perform in the concert.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, total concert time: 2 hours = 120 minutes.

Each group: 2 minutes on stage, 6 minutes performing, 2 minutes off-stage. So, 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.

Then, intermission: 10 minutes.

So, each group plus intermission is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.

So, 120 ÷ 20 = 6. So, 6 groups.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 6 groups, each taking 10 minutes, and 10 minutes for intermission, so 6*10 + 10 = 70 minutes. Wait, that seems right. 6 groups take 60 minutes, and the intermission is 10 minutes, so total is 70 minutes. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
