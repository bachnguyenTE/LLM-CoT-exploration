Q: Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ruiz and Marissa making chocolates. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Hmm, so I need to find out how many pounds Ruiz makes in one hour. If she makes 120 pounds in two hours, then in one hour she would make half of that, right? So, 120 divided by 2 is 60. So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour. Got that.

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz does in two hours. Wait, that seems right. So, first, I need to figure out how many pounds Marissa makes in an hour. Since Marissa's rate is 3/4 of Ruiz's rate, and we know Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, then Marissa's rate is 3/4 of 60. Let me calculate that.

3/4 of 60 is... Well, 60 divided by 4 is 15, and 15 times 3 is 45. So, Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, they worked for 12 hours in a day. I need to find the total amount of chocolate they made together. So, I should calculate how much each of them made in 12 hours and then add them together.

Starting with Ruiz. She makes 60 pounds per hour. So, in 12 hours, she would make 60 multiplied by 12. Let me compute that. 60 times 10 is 600, and 60 times 2 is 120, so adding those together gives 660 + 120 = 780. Wait, that seems right. 60 times 12 is 720? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 60 times 10 is 600, plus 60 times 2 is 120, so 600 + 120 is 7220? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 60 times 12 is 720. Yeah, okay, so 720 pounds from Ruiz.

Now, Marissa. She makes 45 pounds per hour. So, in 12 hours, she would make 45 times 12, which is 90 pounds. So, 45 times 12 is 90. That seems correct.

So, together, they made 720 pounds from Ruiz and 90 pounds from Marissa. So, adding those together, 720 + 90. Let me compute that. 720 + 90 is 810. So, together, they made 810 pounds of chocolates in a day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Ruiz's rate: 120 pounds in 2 hours, so 60 per hour. That's correct. Marissa's rate is 3/4 of that, so 3/4 of 60 is 45. That's correct. Then, in 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60*12=720. Marissa makes 45*12=540. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
