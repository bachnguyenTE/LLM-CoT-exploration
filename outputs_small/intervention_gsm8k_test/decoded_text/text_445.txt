Q: Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Michael has after he buys the hay for his horse. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that for every mile the horse runs, Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. So, I need to find out how much hay Michael needs for the horse. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if the horse runs a mile, he eats half a bail. So, if the horse runs more miles, he'll need more hay.

But, that seems right. So, the first thing is to figure out how many miles the horse runs. The problem says the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the distance the horse covers in 30 minutes at that speed.

Let me recall that speed is distance over time, so distance equals speed multiplied by time. But, that seems right. So, the horse's speed is 32 miles per hour, and it runs for 30 minutes. So, I need to convert the time from minutes to hours because the speed is in miles per hour.

So, 30 minutes is equal to 30/60 hours, which is 0.5 hours. Wait, that seems right. 30 divided by 60 is 0.5. So, 0.5 hours.

So, distance equals speed multiplied by time, which is 32 mph times 0.5 hours. Let me calculate that. 32 times 0.5 is 16. So, the horse runs 16 miles.

Wait, that seems right. 32 mph for half an hour is 16 miles. So, the horse runs 16 miles.

Now, for every mile, Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, he needs 1/2 times 16 bails. Let me compute that. 1/2 of 16 is 8. So, he needs 8 bails of hay.

Each bail costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 times 3. Let me calculate that. 8 times 3 is 24. So, the total cost is $24.

Now, Michael has six 5 dollar bills. So, let me figure out how much money that is. Each 5 dollar bill is $5, so six of them would be 6 times 5, which is 30. So, Michael has $30.

He buys the hay for $24, so the change he gets back is the amount he has minus the cost of the hay. So, $30 minus $24 is $6. So, Michael has $6 in change.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, the horse's speed is 32 mph, time is 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. So, distance is 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles. Correct.

Hay consumption: 1/2 a bail per mile. So, 16 miles * 1/2 = 8 bails. Correct.

Cost per bail is $3, so 8 * 3 = $24. Correct.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills: 6 * 5 = $30. Correct.

Change is $30 - $24 = $6. Correct.

So, the answer is $6.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if I missed anything.

Wait, that seems right. The problem is straightforward. So, I think the answer is $6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}

Michael notices that his horse runs 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile. A bail of hay costs $3. The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.

First, convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Calculate the distance the horse runs:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Determine the amount of hay needed:
\[ \text{Hay needed} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} \times 16 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Calculate the total cost of the hay:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails}
