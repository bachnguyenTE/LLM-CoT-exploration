Q: There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his classes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes math problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. Let me read it again.

There are 6 periods in a day for a normal student, but, that seems right. John has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. Then, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. The question is asking how many hours a week he spends learning.
