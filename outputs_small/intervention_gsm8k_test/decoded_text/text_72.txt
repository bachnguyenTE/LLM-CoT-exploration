Q: Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. If Tommy sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake, how much money does Tommy raise?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tommy is raising money for his charity by selling brownies and cheesecakes. Each brownie costs $3, and each cheesecake slice costs $4. He sold 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake. I need to figure out how much money he raised in total. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably calculate the total money raised from the brownies and then the total from the cheesecakes separately. After that, I can add both amounts together to get the overall total. That makes sense because each item has its own price, so they should be calculated individually.

Starting with the brownies. Each brownie is $3, and he sold 43 of them. So, to find the total money from brownies, I need to multiply the number of brownies sold by the price per brownie. That would be 43 multiplied by $3. Let me write that down:

Total from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie

Hmm, 43 times 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 40 times 3 is 12, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 129. Wait, that seems right. 40*3 is 120, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 43*3 is 129. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total from brownies is $129.

Now, moving on to the cheesecakes. Each cheesecake slice is $4, and he sold 23 slices. So, similar to the brownies, I need to multiply the number of cheesecakes sold by the price per slice. That would be 23 multiplied by $4.

Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice

Let me calculate that. 20 slices times 4 is 80, and 3 slices times 4 is 12. So, 80 + 12 is 92. So, the total from cheesecakes is $92.

Now, to find the total money raised, I need to add the total from brownies and the total from cheesecakes together. So, that would be $129 (from brownies) plus $92 (from cheesecakes). Wait, that seems right. Let me add them up.

$129 + $92. Hmm, 129 plus 92. Let me break it down. 129 plus 90 is 219, and then plus 2 is 221. So, the total amount of money Tommy raised is $221.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, brownies: 43 * 3. 40*3 is 120, and 3*3 is 9, so 120 + 9 is 129. That's correct.

Cheesecakes: 23 * 4. 20*4 is 80, and 3*4 is 12, so 80 + 12 is 92. That's correct.

Adding them together: 129 + 92. Let's add the units place: 9 + 2 is 11, carry over 1. Then tens place: 2 + 9 is 11, plus the carried over 1 is 12. So, 121. Wait, that seems right.
