Q: Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of money Colby has. He has different types of coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. I'll calculate the value of each type separately.

For the quarters, each quarter is worth 25 cents, and he has 8 of them. So, 8 quarters equal 8 times 25 cents, which is 40 cents.

Next, the dimes are worth 10 cents each, and he has 6 dimes. Multiplying 6 by 10 gives 60 cents.

Then, the nickels are worth 5 cents each, and he has 14 nickels. Calculating 14 times 5 cents results in 70 cents.

Finally, the pennies are worth 1 cent each, and he has 15 pennies. Multiplying 15 by 1 cent gives 5 cents.

Adding up all the values: 40 cents (quarters) + 60 cents (dimes) + 70 cents (nickels) + 5 cents (pennies) equals 181 cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, I'll divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.

181 cents divided by 5 cents per gumball equals 36.2. However, since he can't buy a fraction of a gumball, he can only buy 36 gumballs.

**Solution:**

Colby wants to buy gumballs that cost **5 cents** each. He has the following coins:

- **8 quarters** (each worth 25 cents)
- **6 dimes** (each worth 10 cents)
- **14 nickels** (each worth 5 cents)
- **15 pennies** (each worth 1 cent)

**Step 1: Calculate the total value of each type of coin.**

1. **Quarters:**
   \[
   8 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 = \$2.00
   \]
   
2. **Dimes:**
   \[
   6 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10 = \$0.60
   \]
   
3. **Nickels:**
   \[
   14 \text{ nickels} \times \$0.05 = \$0.70
   \]
   
4. **Pennies:**
   \[
   15 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01 = \$0.15
   \]

**Step 2: Add up all the values to find the total amount of money Colby has.**

\[
\$2.00 + \$0.60 + \$0.70 + \$0.15 = \$3.45
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many gumballs Colby can buy.**

Each gumball costs **5 cents**. To find out how many gumballs he can buy with his **\$3.45**, divide the total amount of money by the cost per gumball.

\[
\frac{\$3.45}{\$0.05} = 6.9
\]

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a gumball, he can only buy **6 gumballs**.

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
