Q: When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sophie and her nephew. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Sophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Then there's a bin of stuffed animals with 8 of them. And a tower of stacking rings that has 9 multicolored rings. So, so far, we have these three types of toys. 

Then, Sophie bought a tube of bouncy balls, and after adding those, her total number of toys for her nephew went up to 62. The question is asking how many bouncy balls came in the tube. So, I need to find out the number of bouncy balls.

Let me break this down. So, initially, Sophie has three types of toys: building blocks, stuffed animals, and rings. The numbers are 31, 8, and 9 respectively. Then, she adds bouncy balls, and the total becomes 62. So, I think I need to add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, rings, and bouncy balls to get the total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of toys is the sum of all these individual toys. So, if I add up the building blocks, stuffed animals, rings, and bouncy balls, that should equal 62. So, let me write that as an equation.

Let me denote the number of bouncy balls as B. So, the equation would be:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) +9 (rings) + B (bouncy balls) = 62.

So, if I compute the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and rings first, then subtract that from 62, I should get the number of bouncy balls.

Let me compute that. So, 31 + 8 is 39. Then, 39 +9 is 48. So, the total number of toys before adding the bouncy balls is 48. Wait, that seems right. 31 +8 is 39, plus 9 is 48. So, 48 toys before adding the bouncy balls.

Then, the total after adding the bouncy balls is 62. So, the number of bouncy balls is 62 minus 48. Let me compute that. 62 - 48. Hmm, 62 minus 48 is... Wait, that seems right. 62 is less than 48, so I need to borrow from the tens place.

Wait, that seems right. So, 62 - 48. Let me write it down:

62
-48
----
?

Starting from the units place: 2 - 8. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. So, 12 - 8 is 4. Then, the tens place is now 5 (since we borrowed 1), so 5 - 4 is 1. So, the result is 14.

Wait, that seems right. So, 62 - 48 is 14. So, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 31 +8 is 39, plus 9 is 48, plus 14 is 62. Yes, that adds up. So, 31 +8 +9 +14 = 62. So, that seems correct.

So, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, 31 +8 is 39, correct. 39 +9 is 48, correct. 48 +14 is 62, correct. So, yes, that's correct.

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

I think that's the answer. So, the number of bouncy balls is 14.

**Final Answer**
The number of bouncy balls in the tube is \boxed{14}.
</think>

Sophie has a bag of building blocks with 31 blocks, a bin of stuffed animals with 8 stuffed animals, and a tower of stacking rings with 9 rings. After adding a tube of bouncy balls, the total number of toys becomes 62. 

To find the number of bouncy balls, we first calculate the total number of toys before adding the bouncy balls:

\[
31 + 8 + 9 = 48
\]

Next, we subtract this total from the final total to find the number of bouncy balls:

\[
62 - 48 = 14
