Q: Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Madeline, her brother, and their mother eating grapes. I need to figure out how many grapes there were at the beginning. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Madeline ate 6 grapes. That's straightforward. So, right away, I know that the total number of grapes is more than 6 because her brother and their mother are using grapes for other things too.

Next, it says her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Hmm, so if Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 times that amount. Let me write that down.

Madeline ate: 6 grapes.

Her brother used: 5 times as many as Madeline, so that's 5 * 6 grapes. Let me calculate that: 5 * 6 is 30 grapes. Wait, that seems right. So, her brother used 30 grapes for the juice.

Now, moving on to their mother. She used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. So, I need to figure out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate their share. Then, those remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies, each requiring 12 grapes. So, I need to calculate the total grapes used for the pies and then add that to the grapes eaten by Madeline and her brother to get the total number at the beginning.

Let me structure this:

1. Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6 grapes.
2. Grapes used by her brother: 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. Grapes remaining after her brother: Let's call this R.
4. Grapes used for pies: 4 pies * 12 grapes per pie = 48 grapes.
5. So, R + 48 = total grapes at the beginning.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that out.

Total grapes at the beginning = Grapes eaten by Madeline + Grapes used by her brother + Grapes used for pies.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total grapes = 6 + 30 + 48.

Let me add those up step by step.

First, 6 + 30 is 36.

Then, 36 + 48. Hmm, 36 + 40 would be 76, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 36 + 48 is 84.

Wait, that seems right. So, 6 +30 is 36, plus 48 is 84. So, total grapes at the beginning were 84.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times that, which is 30 grapes. So, together, they ate 6 +30 =36 grapes. Then, their mother used the remaining grapes for pies. Each pie needs 12 grapes, and they made 4 pies, so 4*12=8 grapes. So, the total grapes used for pies is 8. So, the total grapes at the beginning are 36 +8=44. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 6 +30 is 36, plus 8 is 44. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
