Q: Hannah slips on a banana peel and breaks her arm. The doctor charges her $200 for the cast, $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, $4/pill for 30 painkillers, and $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. How much does the doctor's visit cost total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to identify all the costs associated with the doctor's visit.

The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

Next, there's a 30-minute visit with a rate of $300 per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for this visit is $165.

Then, the doctor charges $4 per painkiller for 30 pills. Multiplying the cost per pill by the number of pills gives a total of $120.

Additionally, there's a mandatory parking fee of $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. This results in a parking cost of $12.

Finally, I'll add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit.

To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, let's break down each expense step by step:

1. **Cost of the Cast:**
   \[
   \$200
   \]

2. **Cost of the 30-Minute Visit:**
   - **Rate:** \$300 per hour
   - **Time:** 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times \$300/\text{hour} = \$165
   \]

3. **Cost of Painkillers:**
   - **Price per Painkiller:** \$4
   - **Number of Painkillers:** 30
   \[
   30 \text{ painkillers} \times \$4/\text{painkiller} = \$120
   \]

4. **Cost of Parking:**
   - **Rate:** \$6 per hour
   - **Time:** 2 hours (mandatory minimum)
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times \$6/\text{hour} = \$12
   \]

5. **Total Cost of the Doctor's Visit:**
   \[
   \$200 \ (\text{cast}) + \$165 \ (\text{visit}) + \$120 \ (\text{painkillers}) + \$12 \ (\text{parking}) = \boxed{\$499}
   \]
