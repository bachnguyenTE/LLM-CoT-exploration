Q: To heat during the winter, Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal. The coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, costing $18 per unit. How much does his order cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total number of units Ali needs by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight per unit.

Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of units by the cost per unit.

Finally, present the total cost in the required format.
</think>

**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of units:**
   
   Ali ordered **850 kilograms** of coal, and each unit (bag) weighs **50 kilograms**.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of units} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per unit}} = \frac{850\ \text{kg}}{50\ \text{kg/unit}} = 17\ \text{units}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   Each unit costs **\$18**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of units} \times \text{Cost per unit} = 17 \times \$18 = \$306
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$306}
\]
