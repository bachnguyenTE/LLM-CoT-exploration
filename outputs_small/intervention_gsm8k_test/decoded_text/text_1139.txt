Q: Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Russell is ordering bagels, and I need to figure out how much each single bagel will cost. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and contains 9 bagels. Russell is ordering 4 packs. Hmm, so I should calculate the total cost for 4 packs before any discount. 

Each pack is $10.00, so 4 packs would be 4 times $10.00. Let me write that out: 4 * $10.00. That should be $40.00. So, the total cost before any discount is $40.00.

But, that seems right. 4 packs at $10 each is $40. Then, he gets a 10% discount. Wait, that seems right. 10% is like 10 per 100, so 10% of $40.00. Let me calculate that. 

To find 10% of $40.00, I can multiply 40.00 by 0.10. So, 40.00 * 0.10. Let me do that. 40.00 * 0.10 is 4.00. So, the discount is $4.00. 

Therefore, the total cost after discount is the original total minus the discount. So, $40.00 - $4.00. Let me subtract that. 40.00 - 4.00 is 36.00. So, the total cost after discount is $36.00.

Now, he ordered 4 packs, each with 9 bagels. So, how many bagels is that in total? 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack. Let me calculate that: 4 * 9 is 36. So, he's getting 36 bagels in total.

He needs to find the cost per bagel. So, the total cost is $36.00, and he's getting 36 bagels. So, each bagel would cost $36.00 divided by 36. Let me do that division. 36 divided by 36 is 1. So, each bagel is $1.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

1. Each pack is $10.00, 4 packs would be 4*10 = $40.00. That's correct.
2. 10% discount on $40.00 is 0.10*40 = $4.00. So, total after discount is 40 - 4 = $36.00. That's correct.
3. 4 packs, each with 9 bagels, so 4*9 = 36 bagels. Correct.
4. $36.00 divided by 36 bagels is $1.00 per bagel. That makes sense.

So, each bagel costs $1.00. Hmm, that seems a bit expensive, but, that seems right. Let me think again. 4 packs at $10 each is $40, 10% off is $4, so $36 total. 36 bagels, so $1 each. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be $1.00 per bagel.

**Final Answer**
The cost per single bagel is \boxed{1.00}.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, each costing $10.00. The total cost for 4 packs is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \]

He receives a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:

\[ 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives:

\[ 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \]

Russell orders 4 packs, each containing 9 bagels, so the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

The cost per single bagel is:

\[ \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is \boxed{1.00}.
