Q: Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.  How many diapers does Jordan change per day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jordan and her children. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. Hmm, so each child needs 5 diapers every day. Since there are 2 children, I should multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes each child needs. That makes sense because if each child needs 5, then two children would need 5 times 2. Let me write that down:

Number of diaper changes per day for children = 2 children * 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes per day.

Alright, so the children together require 10 diaper changes each day. Now, the problem also mentions that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, Jordan's wife is responsible for half of what the children need. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if the children need 10 diaper changes per day, and the wife changes half of that, then the number of diaper changes Jordan needs to make would be half of 10. Let me calculate that:

Number of diaper changes Jordan needs to make = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers each day. That seems straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 2 children, each needing 5 diaper changes. 2 times 5 is 10. That part seems correct. Then, the wife changes half of the diapers. Half of 10 is 5. So, yes, Jordan changes 5 per day. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 5. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the problem is saying that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers that the children wear, but, that seems right. So, the total number of diapers is 10, and the wife changes half, which is 5, so Jordan changes the other 5. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the wife changes half of the diapers that Jordan changes. But, that seems right. It says, "Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers." So, the half is of the total number of diaper changes required by the children, which is 10. So, half is 5. So, Jordan changes 5.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 5. So, I think that's correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the problem is saying that the wife changes half of the diapers that Jordan changes. But, that seems right.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of diapers Jordan changes per day is \boxed{5}.

First, we determine the total number of diaper changes required by Jordan's two children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children:

\[
2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes/child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day}
\]

Next, we find out how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes. The problem states that the wife changes half of the diaper changes required by the children:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day}
\]

Thus, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is \boxed{5}.
