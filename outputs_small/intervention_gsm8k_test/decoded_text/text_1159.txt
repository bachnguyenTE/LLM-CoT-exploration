Q: Carla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?

Okay, so Carla has just given birth to identical octuplets. That's interesting because octuplets are usually just one or two, but, that seems right. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. Hmm, so out of eight babies, 6 are purple and 2 are blue. Let me write that down:

- Total octuplets: 8
- Purple: 3/4 * 8 = 6
- Blue: 1/4 * 8 = 2

Alright, so 6 are purple and 2 are blue. Now, the problem says that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. I need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. So, essentially, I need to find the probability that a baby is wearing purple given that they are wearing a bow.

This sounds like a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that B has happened.
- P(A ∩ B) is the probability that both A and B happen.
- P(B) is the probability that event B happens.

In this case:
- Event A: The baby is wearing purple.
- Event B: The baby is wearing a bow.

So, I need to find P(Purple | Bow), which is the probability that a baby is wearing purple given that they are wearing a bow.

First, let's figure out how many babies are wearing a bow. The problem says all blue-wearers wear a bow, and 1/3 of the purple wearers wear a bow.

So, number of blue-wearers: 2 (since 1/4 of 8 is 2). All of these wear a bow, so that's 2 babies.

Number of purple wearers: 6. 1/3 of them wear a bow. So, 6 * (1/3) = 2. So, 2 purple wearers wear a bow.

Therefore, total number of babies wearing a bow is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

So, out of these 4 babies wearing a bow, 2 are wearing purple. So, the probability is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Total babies: 8.

Number of purple wearers: 6.

Number of purple wearers wearing a bow: 6 * (1/3) = 2.

Number of blue wearers: 2.

Number of blue wearers wearing a bow: 2.

Total wearing a bow: 2 + 2 = 4.

So, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 2/4 = 1/2.

So, 50% chance.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 50%.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions.

Total number of babies: 8.

Number of purple: 6.

Number of purple wearing a bow: 6 * (1/3) = 2.

Number of blue wearing a bow: 2.

Total wearing a bow: 2 + 2 = 4.

So, the probability is 2/4 = 1/2.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions without numbers.

Let me denote:

Let P be the event that a baby is wearing purple.

Let B be the event that a baby is wearing a bow.

We need to find P(P | B) = P(P ∩ B) / P(B)

We know that P(P) = 6/8 = 3/4.

P(B) is the probability that a baby is wearing a bow. Since all blue wearers wear a bow, and 1/3 of purple wearers wear a bow.

So, P(B) = P(B | Blue) * P(Blue) + P(B | Purple) * P(Purple)

Since all blue wearers wear a bow, P(B | Blue) = 1.

P(Blue) = 2/8 = 1/4.

P(B | Purple) = 1/3.

P(Purple) = 6/8 = 3/4.

So, P(B) = 1*(1/4) + (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4 + (1/3)*(3/4) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So, P(B) = 1/2.

Now, P(P ∩ B) is the probability
