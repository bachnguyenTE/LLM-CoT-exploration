Q: Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.  Assuming his dogs each has four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Each dog has four legs, and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Hmm, let me figure out how much it will cost him in total.

First, I should probably figure out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs. Since each dog has four legs, does that mean he needs four pairs of snowshoes per dog? Or is it two pairs? Wait, that seems right. Each dog has four legs, so Mario would need two pairs of snowshoes per dog because each pair covers two legs. So, for each dog, it's two pairs.

So, if Mario has 6 dogs, each needing two pairs, that would be 6 dogs multiplied by 2 pairs per dog. Let me write that down: 6 * 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes. Okay, so he needs 12 pairs in total.

Now, each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. So, to find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair. That would be 12 pairs * $12.00 per pair.

Let me do that multiplication. 12 times 12 is 144, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 12 * 12 is 144, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
