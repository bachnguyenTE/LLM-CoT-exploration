Q: Johnny took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it.  He then invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year.  How much money did he have after a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Johnny and his allowance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Johnny took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. Hmm, so that means he started with $20 and then added $10 more. Let me write that down. 

So, $20 plus $100. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 plus 10 is 30. So, Johnny had $30 in total after adding the extra money. 

Then, he invested this sum of money, which tripled in a year. Hmm, okay, so tripling means multiplying by 3, right? So, if he had $30 and it tripled, that would be 3 times 30. Let me calculate that. 

3 times 30 is... 3 times 3 is 9, and 3 times 0 is 0, so 90. So, that's $90 after a year. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. He started with $20, added $10, so $30. Then, tripling that would be 3 times 30, which is 90. Yeah, that makes sense. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. He added the money first, then tripling it. So, the total after a year is $90. 

I think that's the answer. Let me just write it out again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Johnny started with $20. He added $10 to it, so 20 + 10 = 30. Then, he invested this amount, which tripled. So, 30 times 3 is 90. So, after a year, he had $90.

Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I need to do anything else here. It's a simple addition and multiplication problem.

**Final Answer**
The amount of money Johnny had after a year is \boxed{90}.

Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. This gives a total of:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

He then invested this amount, which tripled in a year. Tripling $30 results in:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

Thus, the amount of money Johnny had after a year is \(\boxed{90}\).
