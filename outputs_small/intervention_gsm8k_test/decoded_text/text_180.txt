Q: Two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai's school. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and the total number of students who voted in the class was 80, calculate the number of votes the loser got.

Okay, so I have this problem here where two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai's school. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and the total number of students who voted was 80. I need to find out how many votes the loser got. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two candidates, and the total number of votes cast is 80. The winner received 3/4 of those votes. So, I need to find out how many votes the loser got. That means I need to figure out how many votes the loser received, which would be the remaining votes after subtracting the winner's votes from the total.

Alright, so if the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 3/4 of them, I can calculate the number of votes the winner got first. Then, subtract that from the total to get the loser's votes.

Let me write that down step by step.

First, calculate the number of votes the winner got:
Number of votes for winner = (3/4) * Total votes

Total votes = 80, so:
Number of votes for winner = (3/4) * 80

Hmm, let me compute that. 3/4 of 80. Well, 80 divided by 4 is 22, because 4 times 22 is 88, which is 8 more than 80. Wait, that seems right. So, 80 divided by 4 is 22. Then, 3 times 22 is 66. So, 3/4 of 80 is 66.

So, the winner got 66 votes. Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, I subtract the winner's votes from the total.

Number of votes for loser = Total votes - Votes for winner
Number of votes for loser = 80 - 66

Let me compute that. 80 minus 66. Hmm, 80 minus 60 is 20, and then minus 6 more is 14. So, 80 minus 66 is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 3/4 of 80. 80 divided by 4 is 20, and 20 times 3 is 60. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
