Q: Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Bob and his marbles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says: "Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?"

Wait, that seems right. Let me parse it again. So, Bob currently has some number of marbles. If he gets 2 dozen more, that means he adds 24 marbles because a dozen is 12. So, 2 dozen is 24. After adding those, he'll have 60 marbles. So, if I let the number of marbles Bob currently has be, let's say, x, then x + 24 = 60. So, to find x, I can subtract 24 from both sides. That would give me x = 60 - 24, which is 36. So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

Now, the second part of the problem says, if he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will he have? So, he currently has 36 marbles, and he loses 10. So, that would be 36 - 10. Let me calculate that. 36 minus 10 is 26. So, Bob will have 26 marbles left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Bob has 36 marbles, and he gets 24 more, that's 36 + 24, which is 60. That matches the problem statement. Then, if he loses 10 marbles, 60 - 10 is 50?
