Q: Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Okay, so Sasha has some lumber left after buying some, and she wants to sell it to make a profit. Let me try to figure out how much she'll make. 

First, let me break down the information given. She has two types of boards: some 2x4x10 boards and some 4x4x10 boards. The 2x4x10 boards cost her $10 each, and she has ten of them. The 4x4x10 boards cost her $16 each, and she has five of those. 

Wait, that seems right. So, she has ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each and five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each. She wants to sell all of them. But, that seems right. So, to find her total revenue, I need to calculate the total amount she gets from selling all these boards and then subtract her total cost to find her profit.

Let me write that down step by step.

First, calculate the total revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards. She has ten of them, each sold for $10. So, that would be 10 boards multiplied by $10 each. Let me compute that: 10 * 10 = $100. So, she makes $100 from selling the 2x4x10 boards.

Next, she has five 4x4x10 boards, each costing her $16. So, the revenue from these would be 5 * 16. Let me calculate that: 5 *16 = $30. So, she makes $30 from selling the 4x4x10 boards.

Now, to find the total revenue, I need to add these two amounts together. So, $100 + $30 = $130. So, she makes a total of $130 from selling all her leftover boards.

Now, I need to calculate her total cost. She bought all the boards she has, right? So, she bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each and five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each.

Let me compute the cost for the 2x4x10 boards first. She bought ten of them at $10 each, so that's 10 *10 = $100. 

Then, the cost for the 4x4x10 boards. She bought five of them at $16 each, so that's 5 *16. Let me compute that: 5*16 is $80. 

So, her total cost is the sum of these two amounts. That's $100 + $80 = $180. So, she spent $180 to buy all the boards.

Now, to find her profit, I subtract her total cost from her total revenue. So, that's $130 (revenue) minus $180 (cost). Let me do that: 130 - 180. Hmm, that's a negative number. Wait, that seems right. So, 130 - 180 is -50. So, her profit is -$50, which means she actually lost $50.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, revenue from 2x4x10 boards: 10 *10 = 110? Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 100. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 100? Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 100? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 100? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*10 is 110? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10*1
