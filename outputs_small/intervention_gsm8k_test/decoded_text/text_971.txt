Q: Robert is building a 15 foot long, 10 foot wide, rectangular wooden fence around his garden.  He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.  How many wooden slats will he need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Robert is building a fence around his garden, and I need to figure out how many wooden slats he'll need. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. Wait, that seems right. So, it's a rectangle, which means opposite sides are equal. That makes sense because usually, fences are built around rectangular gardens.

Now, he needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Hmm, so for every foot he builds, he uses 2 slats. That means the number of slats is double the length of the fence in feet. I should calculate the total length of the fence first.

Since it's a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding up all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times length plus 2 times width. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be 2 times 15 feet plus 2 times 10 feet.

Let me write that out: 2 * 15 + 2 * 10. Calculating that, 2*15 is 10, and 2*10 is 20. Adding those together, 10 + 20 equals 32 feet. So, the total perimeter of the fence is 32 feet.

Now, since he needs 2 slats for every foot, I can find the total number of slats by multiplying the total feet by 2. So, 32 feet * 2 slats per foot. That would be 64 slats.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. The perimeter is 2*(15 + 10) which is 2*25, which is 50 feet. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
