Q: Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times while Fred rode it 4 times. After that, each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. If each ride cost 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?

Okay, so Pam and Fred went to a carnival, and I need to figure out how many tickets they used that day. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Then, both of them decided to ride the luge 2 times each. Each ride costs 6 tickets. I need to calculate the total number of tickets they used.

Hmm, let me start by figuring out how many times each of them rode the roller coaster. Pam rode it 2 times, so that's straightforward. Fred rode it 4 times. So, together, they rode the roller coaster 2 + 4 = 6 times. Each roller coaster ride costs 6 tickets, so I can multiply the number of rides by the tickets per ride to find out how many tickets they used for the roller coaster.

So, for the roller coaster, that would be 6 rides * 6 tickets per ride. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36. So, they used 36 tickets just for the roller coaster.

Now, moving on to the luge. The problem says each of them rode the luge 2 times. So, Pam rode it 2 times, and Fred also rode it 2 times. That means together, they rode the luge 2 + 2 = 4 times. Each luge ride also costs 6 tickets, so I need to multiply the number of luge rides by the tickets per ride.

That would be 4 rides * 6 tickets per ride. Let me do that multiplication: 4 * 6 is 24. So, they used 24 tickets for the luge.

Now, to find the total number of tickets they used that day, I need to add the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge together. So, 36 tickets for the roller coaster plus 24 tickets for the luge.

Adding those together: 36 + 24. Let me add the units place first: 6 + 4 is 10. Wait, that seems right. Then, the tens place: 3 + 2 is 5. So, putting it together, that's 50. So, 36 + 24 is 60.

Wait, that seems right. So, Pam and Fred used a total of 60 tickets that day.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, roller coaster: Pam 2 times, Fred 4 times. Total roller coaster rides: 2 + 4 = 6. Each ride is 6 tickets, so 6 * 6 = 36 tickets. That seems correct.

Then, luge: Each of them rode it 2 times, so 2 + 2 = 4. Each luge ride is 6 tickets, so 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. That also seems correct.

Adding them together: 36 + 24. Let me add 36 + 20 first, which is 56, and then add the remaining 4, which makes 60. Yep, that's correct.

So, I think I did that right. So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60.

**Final Answer**
The total number of tickets Pam and Fred used that day is \boxed{60}.

Pam and Fred went to a carnival and rode the roller coaster and luge multiple times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

1. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and Fred rode it 4 times. Together, they rode the roller coaster:
   \[
   2 + 4 = 6 \text{ times}
   \]
   Each ride costs 6 tickets, so the total tickets used for the roller coaster are:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tickets}
   \]

2. Each of them rode the luge 2 times. Together, they rode the luge:
   \[
   2 + 2 = 4 \text{ times}
   \]
   Each luge ride costs 6 tickets, so the total tickets used for the luge are:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ tickets}
   \]

3. Adding the tickets used for the roller coaster and the luge together:
   \[
   36 + 24 = 60 \text{ tickets}
   \]

The total number of tickets Pam and Fred used that day is \boxed{60}.
