Q: James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about James, Robert, and John's candies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says:

"James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have than James?"

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many candies Robert has because both James and John are related to him. The problem gives me information about John, so maybe I can start with that.

It says John has twice as many candies as Robert. So if I let R represent the number of candies Robert has, then John has 2R candies. But, that seems right. So, John = 2 * Robert.

And we know that John has 54 candies. So, substituting that into the equation, we get:

54 = 2 * R

To find R, I can divide both sides by 2. Let me do that:

54 / 2 = R

So, 27 = R. That means Robert has 27 candies.

Now, the problem also says that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has R + 6 candies. Since Robert has 27 candies, James has:

27 + 6 = 33

So, James has 33 candies.

Now, the question is asking how many more candies John has than James. John has 54, and James has 33. So, I need to subtract James's candies from John's to find the difference.

54 - 33 = 21

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. John has twice as many as Robert: John = 2R. John has 54, so 54 = 2R. Therefore, R = 27. That seems correct.

2. James has 6 more than Robert: James = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33. That also seems correct.

3. Difference between John and James: 54 - 33 = 21. Yep, that's 21.

Hmm, I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think the answer is 21.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{21}
</think>

Given that James has 6 more candies than Robert, and John has twice as many candies as Robert, we need to determine how many more candies John has than James. 

First, we know that John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can set up the equation:
\[ 54 = 2R \]
Solving for \( R \) (the number of candies Robert has):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we find the number of of candies James has. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert:
\[ \text{James} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Finally, we calculate how many more candies John has than James:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has \(\boxed{21}\) more candies than James.
