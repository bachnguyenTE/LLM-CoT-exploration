Q: A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about whirligigs, thingamabobs, and whatchamacallits. It seems like it's about speed and ratios. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says: "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob." Hmm, okay. So, if I let the speed of a thingamabob be some value, then the whirligig is five times that. Got it.

Next, it says: "A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob." So, similar to the thingamabob, but, that seems right. So, if a thingamabob is, say, 10 meters per second, then a whatchamacallit would be 11 times that, which is 110 m/s. But, that seems right. So, the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob.

Then, it says: "A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second." So, that's the speed of the whatchamacallit. So, if I can figure out the speed of the thingamabob, I can then find the speed of the whirligig.

Let me write this down to make it clearer.

Let me denote:
- Let V_th = speed of whirligig
- Let V_t = speed of thingamabob
- Let V_w = speed of whatchamacallit

From the problem:
1. V_th = 5 * V_t
2. V_w = 11 * V_t
3. V_w = 121 m/s

So, since V_w is given as 121 m/s, and V_w is 11 times V_t, I can find V_t.

So, V_w = 11 * V_t => 121 = 11 * V_t => V_t = 121 / 11 = 11 m/s.

So, the thingamabob spins at 11 m/s.

Then, since V_th = 5 * V_t, that would be 5 * 11 = 55 m/s.

So, the whirligig spins at 55 m/s.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

If the thingamabob is 11 m/s, then the whatchamacallit is 11 times that, which is 121 m/s. Wait, that seems right. 11 * 11 is 121. So, that's correct.

Then, the whirligig is five times the speed of the thingamabob, so 5 * 11 is 55 m/s. So, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the whirligig is 55 m/s.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the thingamabob is 11 m/s, the whatchamacallit is 11 times that, so 121 m/s, and the whirligig is five times the thingamabob, so 55 m/s.

So, the answer is 55 m/s.

Wait, that seems right. So, the whirligig is 55 m/s.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident with that.

**Final Answer**
The whirligig spins at \boxed{55} meters per second.

Let \( V_{\text{th}} \) be the speed of the whirligig, \( V_t \) be the speed of the thingamabob, and \( V_w \) be the speed of the whatchamacallit.

From the problem:
1. The whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob: \( V_{\text{th}} = 5 \times V_t \).
2. The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob: \( V_w = 11 \times V_t \).
3. The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second: \( V_w = 121 \) m/s.

First, we find the speed of the thingamabob using the given speed of the whatchamacallit:
\[ V_w = 11 \times V_t \]
\[ 121 = 11 \times V_t \]
\[ V_t = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

Next, we find the speed of the whirl
