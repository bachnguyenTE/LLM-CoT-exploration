Q: Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many cupcakes Carly made. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the problem says: "Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." Hmm, okay. So, the number of brownies she makes is related to the number of cupcakes. 

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of cupcakes she makes is C. Then, the number of brownies she makes would be three times that number minus 2, right? Because it's 2 less than three times as many. So, mathematically, that would be:

Number of brownies = 3 * C - 2

Got that down. So, if I can find the value of C, I can find out how many cupcakes she made.

Next, the problem says: "If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?" So, each person gets two treats, and there are five people. That means the total number of treats needed is 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined should be 10. Because each person gets one treat, which can be either a cupcake or a brownie.

So, the total treats are cupcakes plus brownies = 10.

We already have an expression for the number of brownies in terms of cupcakes. So, let's write that equation:

C (cupcakes) + (3C - 2) (brownies) = 10

Now, let's solve this equation for C.

First, expand the equation:

C + 3C - 2 = 10

Combine like terms:

4C - 2 = 10

Now, add 2 to both sides:

4C = 12

Then, divide both sides by 4:

C = 3

So, that means she made 3 cupcakes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

If she made 3 cupcakes, then the number of brownies is 3*3 -2 =9 -2=7 brownies.

Total treats: 3 +7=10, which is correct because 5 people each getting 2 treats is 10 treats.

So, that seems to add up.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 3 cupcakes.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.

Starting with:

C + (3C -2) =10

So, C +3C -2=10

4C -2=10

4C=12

C=3

Yes, that's correct.

So, the number of cupcakes is 3.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 3.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The number of cupcakes Carly made is \boxed{3}.
</think>

Let \( C \) be the number of cupcakes Carly made. The number of brownies she made is \( 3C - 2 \). 

The total number of treats needed is 10 (since each of the 5 people gets 2 treats). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Thus, the number of cupcakes Carly made is \(\boxed{3}\).
