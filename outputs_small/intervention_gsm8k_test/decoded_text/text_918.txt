Q: There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. If each student only participates in one group, how many students are there in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the number of students playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, there are 12 students playing volleyball.

Next, calculate the total number of students playing sports. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, making a total of 38 students playing soccer.

Finally, add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students. This gives a total of 6 + 12 +38 = 56 students.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Students Playing Tennis and Volleyball:**
   - **Tennis:** 6 students
   - **Volleyball:** Twice the number of students playing tennis.
     \[
     \text{Volleyball} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
     \]

2. **Number of Students Playing Soccer:**
   - **Boys:** 16
   - **Girls:** 22
   - **Total Students Playing Soccer:**
     \[
     16 \text{ boys} + 22 \text{ girls} = 38 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Students:**
   - Add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer.
     \[
     6 \text{ (Tennis)} + 12 \text{ (Volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (Soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
