Q: Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. If Matthew would agree to that offer, how much money would he earn?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers.

He decides to split his collection into two equal parts, which means 6 soldiers in each half.

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per soldier for the first half and $7 per soldier for the second half.

To calculate the total earnings, multiply the number of soldiers in each half by their respective prices and then add the two amounts together.

So, 6 soldiers at $5 each equal $30, and 6 soldiers at $7 each equal $42. Adding these together gives a total of $72.

**Solution:**

Matthew has a total of **12 unique toy soldiers**. He wants to sell them to a buyer who offers different prices for two halves of his collection.

1. **Split the Collection:**
   - Matthew divides his 12 soldiers into two equal parts.
   - **First half:** 6 soldiers
   - **Second half:** 6 soldiers

2. **Calculate Earnings from Each Half:**
   - **First half:** The buyer is willing to pay **\$5** per soldier.
     \[
     6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$5/\text{soldier} = \$30
     \]
   - **Second half:** The buyer is willing to pay **\$7** per soldier.
     \[
     6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$7/\text{soldier} = \$42
     \]

3. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   \$30 + \$42 = \$72
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{72}
\]
