Q: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Russell distributing straw in a pet store. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem says that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Then, there are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There's also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. It mentions that no straw is used elsewhere, and that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. The question is asking how many rats are in each cage.

Alright, let me break this down. So, the main goal is to find the number of rats per cage. Let's denote the number of rats per cage as 'r'. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, that means each cage has 'r' rats. 

Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. So, for each cage, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats would be 6 pieces per rat multiplied by the number of rats in that cage, which is 'r'. So, per cage, the straw given is 6r pieces.

Since there are 3 cages, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats would be 3 times 6r, which is 18r. So, total straw for rats is 18r.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 cages, each with 'r' rats, each rat gets 6 pieces, so 3 * r * 6 = 18r. Got that.

Now, moving on to the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, each cage has, let's see, how many hamsters? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each cage has a certain number of hamsters, each given 5 pieces. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
