Q: I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how old I am. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, let me list out all the information given:

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
2. I am two years older than my sister.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
4. The sum of all our ages is 87.

And the question is asking how old I am. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find my age. Let me see how to approach this.

I think the best way is to assign variables to each of my siblings' ages and then set up equations based on the information given. That way, I can solve for the variables and find my age.

Let me start by assigning variables:

Let me denote:
- My age as \( x \).
- My brother's age as \( b \).
- My sister's age as \( s \).
- My mom's age as \( m \).

Now, let's translate each piece of information into an equation.

1. I am three years younger than my brother.
   - That means my age is equal to my brother's age minus three.
   - So, \( x = b - 3 \). Got that.

2. I am two years older than my sister.
   - Similarly, my age is equal to my sister's age plus two.
   - So, \( x = s + 2 \). Okay.

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.
   - That means my mom's age is three times my brother's age minus one.
   - So, \( m = 3b - 1 \). Alright.

4. The sum of all our ages is 87.
   - So, \( x + b + s + m = 87 \). That's the total.

Now, I have four equations:

1. \( x = b - 3 \)
2. \( x = s + 2 \)
3. \( m = 3b -1 \)
4. \( x + b + s + m = 87 \)

Hmm, so I have four equations and four variables: x, b, s, m. That should be solvable.

Let me see how to proceed. Maybe I can express all variables in terms of one variable and then substitute.

Looking at equation 1: \( x = b -3 \). So, I can express x in terms of b. Similarly, equation 2: \( x = s + 2 \). So, x can also be expressed in terms of s. Maybe I can set these equal to each other or express s in terms of b.

Wait, that seems right. Let me try that.

From equation 1: \( x = b -3 \)
From equation 2: \( x = s + 2 \)

So, since both equal x, I can set them equal to each other:

\( b -3 = s + 2 \)

Let me solve for s in terms of b.

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\( b -3 -2 = s \)
\( b -5 = s \)

So, \( s = b -5 \). Got that.

So, now I have expressions for both x and s in terms of b.

So, x is \( b -3 \), and s is \( b -5 \).

Now, let's look at equation 3: \( m = 3b -1 \). So, m is already in terms of b.

So, now, let's substitute all these into equation 4.

Equation 4: \( x + b + s + m =87 \)

Substituting:

\( (b -3) + b + (b -5) + (3b -1) =87 \)

Let me simplify this step by step.

First, expand all the terms:

\( b -3 + b + b -5 + 3b -1 =87 \)

Now, let's combine like terms.

First, the b terms:

b + b + b + 3b = 6b

Now, the constants:

-3 -5 -1 = -9

So, putting it together:

6b -9 =87

Now, solve for b.

Add 9 to both sides:

6b =87 +9
6b=96

Divide both sides by 6:

b=96/6
b=16

So, my brother is 16 years old.

Now, let's find my age, which is x.

From equation 1: \( x = b -3 \)
So, x=16 -3=3

Wait, that seems right. So, I
