Q: Sandra, the florist around the corner, is very unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Sandra and Fred, and I need to figure out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Hmm, okay. So if I let the number of white carnations be some variable, say W, then the number of red roses would be 4 times that, right? So red roses = 4W.

Next, it mentions that Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and that's equal to five times the white carnations. So, 200 = 5W. Wait, that seems right. So if I solve for W, I can find the number of white carnations.

Let me write that down:

200 = 5W

To find W, I can divide both sides by 5.

So, W = 200 / 5

Calculating that, 200 divided by 5 is 40. So W = 40. That means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Now, since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, I can plug in W = 40 into that equation.

Red roses = 4 * W = 4 * 40

Calculating that, 4 times 40 is 160. So, red roses = 160.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If there are 40 white carnations, then red roses are four times that, which is 160. And the pink calla lilies are 200, which is five times the white carnations. 5 times 40 is indeed 200. So that checks out.

So, putting it all together, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. She has a threat to switch suppliers if the red roses aren't delivered by 5 pm. So, Fred must deliver all the red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions that Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So, the key here is that the number of red roses is dependent on the number of white carnations, which is dependent on the number of pink calla lilies.

So, starting from the pink calla lilies, which are 200, and since that's five times the white carnations, we can find the white carnations. Then, using the white carnations, we can find the red roses. So, yeah, 200 divided by 5 is 40 white carnations, and 4 times 40 is 160 red roses.

I think that's solid. I don't see any other numbers or relationships here. So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

**Final Answer**
The number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \boxed{160}.

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( W \) be the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).

Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This gives us the equation:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

The number of red roses is:
\[ 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, the number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \(\boxed{160}\).
