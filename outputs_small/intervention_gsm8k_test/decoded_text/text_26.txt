Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items she bought. Let me see, she bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. Each of these has a different cost. 

First, let me note down the costs for each item. Shorts are $16.50 each, pants are $22.50 each, and shoes are $42 each. So, she bought three of each. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then add them all together.

Let me start with the shorts. Each pair is $16.50, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I should multiply 16.50 by 3. Let me write that down: 16.50 * 3. Hmm, 16 times 3 is 48, and 0.50 times 3 is 1.50, so adding those together, 48 + 1.50 is 49.50. So, the total cost for the shorts is $49.50.

Next, let's move on the pants. Each pair is $22.50, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I need to multiply 22.50 by 3. Let me do that step by step. 22 times 3 is 66, and 0.50 times 3 is 1.50. So, adding those together, 66 + 1.50 is 67.50. So, the total cost for the pants is $67.50.

Now, onto the shoes. Each pair is $42, and she bought 3 pairs. So, I need to multiply 42 by 3. 40 times 3 is 120, and 2 times 3 is 6, so adding those together, 120 + 6 is 126. So, the total cost for the shoes is $126.00.

Alright, now I have the total costs for each type of clothing: shorts at $49.50, pants at $67.50, and shoes at $126.00. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For the shorts: 16.50 * 3. 16 * 3 is 48, 0.50 * 3 is 1.50, so 48 + 1.50 is 49.50. That seems correct.

For the pants: 22.50 * 3. 22 * 3 is 66, 0.50 * 3 is 1.50, so 66 + 1.50 is 67.50. That also looks right.

For the shoes: 42 * 3. 40 * 3 is 120, 2 * 3 is 6, so 120 + 6 is 126.00. Yep, that's correct.

Now, I need to add all these totals together to find the overall amount spent. So, let's add the shorts, pants, and shoes.

First, add the shorts and pants: 49.50 + 67.50. Let me do that. 49 + 67 is 116, and 0.50 + 0.50 is 1.00. So, 116 + 1.00 is 117.00. So, the combined cost for shorts and pants is $117.00.

Now, add the shoes to that total. So, 117.00 + 126.00. Let me add the dollars and cents separately. 117 + 126 is 243, and 0.00 + 0.00 is 0.00. So, adding those together, 243 + 0 is 243.00. Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount spent is $243.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just verify the addition step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Adding 49.50 and 67.50: 49 + 67 is 116, and 0.50 + 0.50 is 1.00, so 116 + 1.00 is
