Q: Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many spoons Julia originally bought. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, Julia was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package. Let's call the number of spoons in that package "x". That makes sense because we don't know how many she originally had, so using a variable is a good idea.

Then, her husband came over and bought a new package with 5 spoons. He gave them to Julia, so Julia now has both her original package and her husband's package. So, the total number of spoons Julia has before she started cooking is x (from her own package) plus 5 (from her husband). So that's x + 5.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she had x, her husband gave her 5, so total is x + 5.

Then, while she was making the stew, she used three spoons to sample her stew. So, she used 3 spoons for that. So, after using 3, how many does she have left? That would be (x + 5) minus 3. So, x + 5 - 3. Which simplifies to x + 2.

Wait, that seems right. So, she had x + 5, used 3, so she has x + 2 left.

Then, later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. So, that means after using 3, she had 12 left. So, x + 2 = 12.

So, to find x, we can solve this equation. Let's do that.

x + 2 = 12

Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 12 - 2

x = 10

So, Julia originally bought a package with 10 spoons.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

She had 10, her husband gave her 5, so total is 15. Then she used 3, so 15 - 3 = 12. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
