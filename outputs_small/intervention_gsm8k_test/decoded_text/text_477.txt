Q: Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Gina's class, and I need to figure out how many kids aren't allergic to anything. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says, "Nine of the kids in Gina's class are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts and 3 are allergic to both. If there are 32 kids in her class, how many aren't allergic to anything?" Hmm, okay. So, we have some kids with allergies to dairy, some to peanuts, and some to both. I need to find out how many kids don't have any allergies.

Alright, let's break this down. I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram or something. So, if I have two groups: one group is kids allergic to dairy, and another group is kids allergic to peanuts. Some kids are in both groups because they're allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Maybe that applies here. Let me recall. The formula is: the total number in either group is equal to the number in the first group plus the number in the second group minus the number in both groups. So, in symbols, that would be:

Total = A + B - Both

Where A is the number of kids allergic to dairy, B is the number allergic to peanuts, and Both is the number allergic to both.

So, plugging in the numbers from the problem: A is 9, B is 6, Both is 3. So, total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both would be 9 + 6 -3. Let me calculate that: 9 +6 is 15, minus 3 is 12. So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

But, that seems right. So, if there are 32 kids in total, and 12 are allergic to something, then the number of kids not allergic to anything would be 32 -12. Let me do that subtraction: 32 minus 12 is 20. So, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, 9 kids are only dairy, 6 are only peanuts, and 3 are both. So, only dairy is 9, only peanuts is 6, and both is 3. So, total allergic is 9 +6 +3 =18?
