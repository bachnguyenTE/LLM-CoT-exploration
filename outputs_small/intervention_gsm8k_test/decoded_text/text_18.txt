Q: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. I need to figure out how many dozens of eggs she'll eat in 4 weeks. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many eggs she uses each day. She makes a 3-egg omelet, right? So, each day, she uses 3 eggs. Got that.

Now, how many days are in 4 weeks? Well, a week has 7 days, so 4 weeks would be 4 times 7. Let me calculate that: 4 * 7 = 28 days. So, Claire eats breakfast for 28 days in 4 weeks.

Each day, she uses 3 eggs, so over 28 days, the total number of eggs she uses is 28 multiplied by 3. Let me do that multiplication: 28 * 3. Hmm, 20 * 3 is 60, and 8 * 3 is 24, so adding those together gives 60 + 24 = 84. So, she uses 84 eggs in total over 4 weeks.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 28 days times 3 eggs per day is 84 eggs. Now, the question asks how many dozens of eggs she will eat. I know that 1 dozen is 12 eggs. So, to find out how many dozens that is, I need to divide the total number of eggs by 12.

So, 84 divided by 12. Let me compute that. 12 goes into 84 how many times? 12 * 7 is 84, right? Because 12 * 5 is 60, and 12 * 2 is 24, so 60 + 24 is 84. So, 12 * 7 = 84. Therefore, 84 divided by 12 is 7.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Eggs per day: 3
2. Days in 4 weeks: 28
3. Total eggs: 3 * 28 = 84
4. Dozen calculation: 84 /12 = 42? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 84 divided by 12 is 42? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
