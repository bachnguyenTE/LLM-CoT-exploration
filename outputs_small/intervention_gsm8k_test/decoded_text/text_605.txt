Q: For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.  How much money did Patrick earn, in dollars, from selling lemonade for 6 hours?

Okay, so Patrick is selling lemonade, and I need to figure out how much money he earned over six hours. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the problem says that Patrick sold lemonade for four hours. During those four hours, he sold 15 cups per hour at a price of $0.50 each. Then, in the next two hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at a higher price of $0.60 each. So, in total, he worked for six hours, right? Let me confirm that: 4 hours plus 2 hours is 6 hours. Yep, that adds up.

Now, I need to calculate how much money he made in each of those time periods and then add them together to get the total earnings. I think the best way to approach this is to calculate the earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

Starting with the first four hours. He sold 15 cups each hour at $0.50 per cup. So, to find the total earnings for this period, I can multiply the number of cups by the price per cup. That is, 15 cups multiplied by $0.50. Let me write that down:

First period earnings = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours

Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as 15 cups/hour * $0.50 per cup, which gives the earnings per hour, and then multiply by 4 hours. Either way, it should give the same result.

Let me compute 15 * 0.50 first. Hmm, 15 cups at $0.50 each. So, 15 cups is 3 times 5 cups. So, 3 * $0.50 is $1.50. So, 15 cups would be $1.50. Then, over four hours, that would be 4 * $1.50. Wait, that seems right. So, 4 * 1.50 is $6.00. So, in the first four hours, he earned $6.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 15 cups at $0.50 each: 15 * 0.50. 10 cups would be $5.00, and 5 cups would be $2.500, so total is $7.50. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
