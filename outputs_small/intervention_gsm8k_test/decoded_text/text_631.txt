Q: In a jewelers store, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell. The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold. If a diamond Jewell is $2000, find the total price for all three jewels.

Okay, so I have this problem here about jewel prices, and I need to figure out the total price for all three jewels: gold, diamond, and silver. Let me try to break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the problem says that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as a diamond jewel. Hmm, okay. So if I know the price of a diamond, I can find the price of a gold one. It also mentions that a diamond jewel is $2000. So, let me write that down.

Price of diamond (D) = $2000.

Now, the price of a gold jewel (G) is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, mathematically, that would be:

G = (4/5) * D.

Since D is $2000, I can plug that in:

G = (4/5) * 2000.

Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, right? So, 0.8 multiplied by 2000. Hmm, 0.8 times 2000. Let me do that step by step.

First, 2000 times 0 is 2000, and 2000 times 0.8 is... wait, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of 2000 as 2000, so 2000 * 0.8.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2000 * 0.8. Let me compute that.

2000 * 0.8: 2000 * 0.8 is the same as 2000 * 8 * 0.1, which is 16000 * 0.1, which is 1600. So, G is $1600.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 4/5 of 2000. 2000 divided by 5 is 400, and 400 times 4 is 1600. Yep, that's correct. So, G is $1600.

Wait, that seems right. So, gold is $1600, diamond is $2000, and silver is $400 less than gold. So, silver's price is G - 400.

So, S = G - 400.

Plugging in G = 1600, so S = 1600 - 400 = 1200.

So, silver is $1200.

Now, the question is asking for the total price for all three jewels: gold, diamond, and silver.

So, total price = G + D + S.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total = 1600 + 2000 +1200.

Let me add them up step by step.

First, 1600 + 2000 is 3600.

Then, 3600 + 1200 is 4800.

So, the total price is $4800.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Diamond is $2000.

2. Gold is 4/5 of diamond, so 4/5 * 2000 = 1600.

3. Silver is 400 less than gold, so 1600 - 400 = 1200.

4. Total is 1600 + 2000 + 1200 = 4800.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations. I converted the fractions correctly, did the arithmetic step by step, and made sure each step was logical. So, I feel confident that $4800 is the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The total price for all three jewels is \boxed{4800}.

The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is calculated as follows:

\[
G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than
