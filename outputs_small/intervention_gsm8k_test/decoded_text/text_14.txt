Okay, so I have this problem here about a dance class with 20 students. Let me try to figure out how to solve it step by step. The question is asking for the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, it says 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance. So, if there are 20 students in total, 20% of 20 is... let me calculate that. 20 times 00% is 22% of 20 students. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 students times 0.20 is 4.4. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 students, 20% is 4.4 students? Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right.
