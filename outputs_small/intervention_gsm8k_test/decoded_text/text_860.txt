Q: Jennifer bought 12 oranges from the market, she gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, and her only boy got 3 oranges. How many oranges did she remain with?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Jennifer starts with 12 oranges.

She gives 2 oranges to each of her three daughters. That's 2 oranges multiplied by 3 daughters, which equals 6 oranges.

Next, she gives 3 oranges to her only son.

Adding the oranges given to the daughters and the son, a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges are distributed.

Subtracting the distributed oranges from the initial count, 12 - 9 = 3 oranges remain with Jennifer.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many oranges Jennifer has left.

1. **Initial Number of Oranges:**
   Jennifer starts with **12 oranges**.

2. **Oranges Given to Daughters:**
   - She has **3 daughters**.
   - She gives **2 oranges** to each daughter.
   - **Oranges given to daughters:** \( 3 \text{ daughters} \times 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} = 6 \text{ oranges} \).

3. **Oranges Given to the Boy:**
   - She has **1 son**.
   - She gives **3 oranges** to her son.
   - **Oranges given to the boy:** \( 1 \text{ son} \times 3 \text{ oranges/son} = 3 \text{ oranges} \).

4. **Total Oranges Given Out:**
   - **Oranges to daughters:** 6 oranges
   - **Oranges to the boy:** 3 oranges
   - **Total oranges given out:** \( 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ oranges} \)

5. **Oranges Remaining with Jennifer:**
   - **Initial oranges:** 12
   - **Oranges given out:** 9
   - **Oranges remaining:** \( 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ oranges} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
