Q: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a fog bank rolling into a city. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles. The city is 42 miles across, from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. I need to find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The fog bank is moving from the ocean to the city, and it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. So, it's a constant speed, right? That means the time it takes to cover each segment of the city is proportional to the distance. So, if I can figure out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles, I can multiply that by 10 minutes to get the total time.

Wait, that seems right. So, if 3 miles take 10 minutes, then 1 mile would take 10 divided by 3 minutes. Let me write that down:

Time per mile = 10 minutes / 3 miles = 10/3 minutes per mile.

But, that seems right. So, for 42 miles, the total time would be 42 miles multiplied by 10/3 minutes per mile. Let me compute that.

Total time = 42 * (10/3) minutes.

Hmm, let me do the multiplication. 42 divided by 3 is 14, and 14 multiplied by 10 is 140. So, 42 * (10/3) = 140 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If 3 miles take 10 minutes, then 6 miles would take 20 minutes, 9 miles would take 30 minutes, and so on. So, each 3 miles adds 10 minutes. So, 42 miles is 14 segments of 3 miles each. 14 times 10 is 140. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a rate problem. The fog bank's rate is 10 minutes per 3 miles, so the rate is 10/3 minutes per mile, as I did before. So, 42 miles times 10/3 minutes per mile is 140 minutes. Wait, that seems right. 42 divided by 3 is 14, 14 times 10 is 140. Yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 140 minutes is the total time. So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire 42-mile city.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions. If 3 miles take 10 minutes, then 42 miles take x minutes. So, set up the proportion:

3 miles / 10 minutes = 42 miles / x minutes.

Cross-multiplying, 3x = 10 * 42.

So, 3x = 420.

Then, x = 420 / 3 = 140 minutes.

Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to confirm it.

Alternatively, maybe using unit conversion. Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can find how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles.

Number of segments = 42 / 3 = 14.

Each segment takes 10 minutes, so total time is 14 * 10 = 140 minutes.

Same result again. So, that seems solid.

Wait, that seems right. So, 14 segments, each taking 10 minutes, so 14*10=140 minutes.

So, 140 minutes is the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the fog bank is moving at a certain speed, but, that seems right. It's a fog bank, so it's moving at a constant speed, so the time is directly proportional to the distance.

So, if it's 10 minutes per 3 miles, then 42 miles is 14 times that, so 14*10=140 minutes.

Alternatively, if I think about the speed, the fog bank's speed is 3 miles per 10 minutes, which is 0 miles per hour? Wait, that seems right. 3 miles in
