Q: Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?

Okay, so Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, right? That means he's going to need more ingredients than the regular recipe. Let me see, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. Hmm, so if it's a quadruple batch, I guess he needs four times that amount, right? So, for flour, that would be 3 cups multiplied by 4, and for milk, it's 1 cup multiplied by 4. Let me write that down.

Flour needed: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Milk needed: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Alright, so Mark needs 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk. Now, the question is about how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk he has to buy. Both flour and milk are sold in larger quantities: flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. So, I need to figure out how many bags of flour he needs and how many bottles of milk he needs, and then find the difference between those two numbers.

Starting with flour: he needs 12 cups. Each bag is 2 cups. So, how many bags does he need? I think I can find this by dividing the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag. So, 12 cups divided by 2 cups per bag. Let me calculate that.

12 ÷ 2 = 6

So, Mark needs 6 bags of flour. That seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to milk: he needs 4 cups. Each bottle is 2 cups. So, how many bottles does he need? Again, I'll divide the total cups by the number of cups per bottle. So, 4 cups divided by 2 cups per bottle.

4 ÷ 2 = 2

So, Mark needs 2 bottles of milk. That also seems straightforward.

Now, the question is asking how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. So, I need to subtract the number of milk bottles from the number of flour bags. That would be 6 bags minus 2 bottles.

6 - 2 = 4

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Flour: 3 cups per batch, quadruple is 12 cups per batch? Wait, that seems right. 3 cups times 4 is 12 cups. So, 12 cups per batch, and each bag is 2 cups. So, 12 divided by 2 is 6. Yeah, that's correct.

Milk: 1 cup per batch, quadruple is 4 cups. Each bottle is 2 cups, so 4 divided by 2 is 2. That's correct too.

Subtracting 2 from 6 gives 4. So, yes, 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

I think that's the answer. So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

**Final Answer**
Mark has to buy \boxed{4} more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies, which requires 4 times the amount of the normal recipe. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. 

For flour:
- The total amount needed is \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\).
- Each bag of flour is 2 cups, so the number of bags needed is \(12 \div 2 = 6\).

For milk:
- The total amount needed is \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\).
- Each bottle of milk is 2 cups, so the number of bottles needed is \(4 \div 2 = 2\).

Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk. The difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

\[
\boxed{4}
