Q: Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. If Naomi caught 17 fish, how many fish did Tommy catch?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many fish Naomi caught, which is given as 17.

Next, since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, I subtract 6 from Naomi's catch to find Darren's catch. So, Darren caught 17 minus 6, which equals 11 fish.

Finally, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. I add 3 to Darren's catch to find Tommy's catch. Therefore, Tommy caught 11 plus 3, totaling 14 fish.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Naomi's Fish:**
   - Naomi caught **17** fish.

2. **Darren's Fish:**
   - Darren caught **6** less than Naomi.
   - Calculation: \( 17 - 6 = 11 \)
   - So, Darren caught **11** fish.

3. **Tommy's Fish:**
   - Tommy caught **3** more fish than Darren.
   - Calculation: \( 11 + 3 = 14 \)
   - Therefore, Tommy caught **14** fish.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
