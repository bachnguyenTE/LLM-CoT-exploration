Q: Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork. She cooked them, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. It took her 30 minutes to cook rice. I need to figure out how long it took her to cook all the food altogether. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what we know:

1. Time to cook rice: 30 minutes.
2. Time to cook pork: 20 minutes more than rice. So, if rice is 30 minutes, pork must be 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down.

Rice (R) = 30 minutes.

Pork (P) = Rice + 20 minutes = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

So, so far, we have R = 30 and P = 50.

Now, beans (B) took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, first, let's find the combined time of pork and rice.

Combined time of pork and rice = P + R = 50 + 30 = 80 minutes.

So, beans took half of that. So, B = (P + R)/2 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, beans took 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time, we need to add up the times for rice, beans, and pork.

Total time = R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50.

Let me add those up. 30 + 40 is 70, and 70 + 50 is 120. So, total time is 120 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Rice is 30 minutes. That's given.

2. Pork is 20 minutes more than rice. So, 30 + 20 = 50. That seems correct.

3. Beans took half the combined time of pork and rice. So, combined time is 50 + 30 = 80. Half of 80 is 40. So, beans are 40 minutes. That makes sense.

4. Adding all together: 30 + 40 + 50. 30 + 40 is 70, plus 50 is 120. So, 120 minutes in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. It says it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, that's pork = rice + 20. So, 30 + 20 =50. That's correct.

Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, combined is 50 +30=80, half is 40. So, beans are 40. So, total is 30 +40 +50=120.

I think that's correct. So, the total time is 120 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any chance I misread the problem. It says "it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice." So, that's pork = rice +20. So, 30 +20=50. So, that's correct.

And beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, combined is 50 +30=80, half is 40. So, beans are 40. So, total is 30 +40 +50=120.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the time to cook beans is half the time of cooking both pork and rice? But, that seems right. It says beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, that's (P + R)/2.

So, that's 80/2=40. So, beans are 40.

So, total is 30 +40 +50=120.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think 120 is the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident with that.
