Q: Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats. While at the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. If they picked 60 oranges, calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Stetson made a bet with Alec. Stetson is going to give Alec $10 for each orange he eats. At the farm, Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked. They picked a total of 60 oranges. I need to figure out how much money Stetson gave up. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Stetson is giving Alec money based on the number of oranges he eats. For each orange he eats, he gives Alec $10. So, the total money he gives up would be the number of oranges he ate multiplied by $10. That makes sense.

Now, they picked 60 oranges in total. Stetson ate 2/5 of those oranges. So, I need to calculate how many oranges that is. To do that, I can multiply the total number of oranges by 2/5. Let me write that down:

Number of oranges eaten = (2/5) * 60

Hmm, let me compute that. 2/5 of 60. Well, 60 divided by 5 is 13.2, right? Because 5 times 13 is 65, and 5 times 13.2 is 66. So, 66 divided by 5 is 13.2. Then, multiplying that by 2 gives me 26.4. Wait, that seems right. So, 2/5 of 66 is 26.4 oranges.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4 times 66. Let me compute 0.4 times 60. 0.4 times 60 is 24.4. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
