Q: Nick had twice as many candies as George. Then George ate 5 candies. Now George has 3 candies left. How many candies does Nick have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, let's determine how many candies George had initially. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, George originally had 8 candies.

Next, since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can calculate Nick's candies by multiplying George's initial amount by 2. Therefore, Nick had 16 candies.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Nick had twice as many candies as George.
- George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left.

**Let’s denote:**
- \( G \) = number of candies George had initially.
- \( N \) = number of candies Nick had initially.

**Step 1: Determine George's initial candies.**

George ate 5 candies and has 3 left:
\[
G - 5 = 3
\]
\[
G = 3 + 5
\]
\[
G = 8
\]

**Step 2: Determine Nick's initial candies.**

Nick had twice as many candies as George:
\[
N = 2 \times G
\]
\[
N = 2 \times 8
\]
\[
N = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
