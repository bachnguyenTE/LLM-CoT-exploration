Q: Jim has a 20 pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Jim and his gum. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Jim has a 20-piece pack of gum. He chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. His school day lasts 8 hours. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner. Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister when she asks for some right before bed. The question is, how many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

Alright, so let's break this down. First, Jim starts with 20 pieces. Then, he spends time at school, which is 8 hours. For every 2 hours he's at school, he chews 1 piece. So, I need to figure out how many pieces he chews during the school day.

Let me calculate that. If he chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and his school day is 8 hours, then how many pieces does he chew during school? Well, 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, he chews 4 pieces during school. That makes sense because 2 hours per piece, 8 hours total, so 4 pieces.

Now, he also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, that's 1 + 1 = 2 more pieces. So, total pieces he chews during the day is 4 (school) + 2 (other times) = 6 pieces.

So, he starts with 20 pieces, chews 6 pieces during the day. So, 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left after the day.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 8 hours divided by 2 hours per piece is 4 pieces. Plus 2 more pieces, so 6 total. 20 - 6 is 14. Hmm, okay.

But, that seems right. So, he has 14 pieces left after the day. Then, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives half of 14 pieces to his sister.

Half of 14 is 7. So, he gives 7 pieces to his sister. So, he has 14 - 7 = -3 pieces left? Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
