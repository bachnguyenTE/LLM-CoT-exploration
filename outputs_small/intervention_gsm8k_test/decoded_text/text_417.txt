Q: Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip. Let me break this down step by step because it seems a bit complicated at first glance, but, that seems right. 

First, the trip is two weeks long, which is 14 days. So, Tom is traveling for 14 days in total. The problem is divided into two weeks, so maybe I should handle the first week and the second week separately. Let me see.

In the first four days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. Hmm, okay, so that's straightforward. If he went 200 km each day for four days, I can calculate the total distance for the first four days by multiplying 200 by 4. Let me write that down:

First four days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 880 km.

Alright, so he covered 880 kilometers in the first four days. Got that.

Then, the problem says that over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. Hmm, okay, so the next two days, he didn't go as far as the first four days. So, I need to calculate 33% of 880 km because 30% is the same as 33%. Let me compute that.

33% of 880 km: 0.33 * 880. Let me do that multiplication. 0.33 times 800 is 264.4, and 0.33 times 80 is 26.4. So, adding those together, 264.4 + 26.4 = 290.8 km. So, over the next two days, he traveled 290.8 km.

Wait, that seems right. So, the next two days, he went 290.8 km in total. So, that's the second part.

Then, on the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. So, that's zero kilometers on the fifth day. So, day five: 0 km.

So, up to day five, he's done 880 + 290.8 + 0 = 1170.8 km.

Then, during the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. So, that's 300 km per day for seven days. So, let me calculate that.

Second week: 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

So, adding that to the previous total: 1170.8 + 2100 = 3270.8 km.

Wait, that seems right. So, in total, Tom traveled 3270.8 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First four days: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km. Wait, that seems right. 200*4 is 800. Then, 33% of 800 is 0.33*800. Let me compute that again. 0.33*800: 0.3*800 is 240, and 0.03*800 is 240, so 240 + 240 is 480. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
