Q: Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.  Skyler's investment accounted for the rest. How much money was Skyler's investment?

Okay, so I have this problem here where three people invested a total of $1200 in a joint savings account. The problem says that Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. Then, after Dylan's investment, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. Finally, Skyler's investment was the rest. I need to figure out how much Skyler invested. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the total investment is $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of that. So, I should calculate how much that is. Let me write that down:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) * 1200

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, so 0.4 times 1200. Hmm, 0 times 1200 is 1200, and 0.4 is 400, so 0.4 times 1200 is 480. So, Dylan invested $480.

Okay, so after Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is 1200 - 480. Let me subtract that. 1200 minus 480 is 720. So, $720 is left after Dylan's investment.

Now, Frances invested 2/3 of that remaining amount. So, let me calculate that.

Frances' investment = (2/3) * 720

Hmm, 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6666..., but, that seems right. So, 0.6666... times 720. Let me compute that. 720 divided by 3 is 240, so 2 times that is 480. So, Frances invested $480.

Wait, that seems right. So, after Frances, the remaining amount is 720 - 480. Let me subtract that. 720 minus 480 is 240. So, $240 is left after Frances' investment.

Therefore, Skyler's investment is the remaining amount, which is $240. So, Skyler invested $240.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, total investment: $1200.

Dylan: 2/5 of 1200 is 480. Correct.

Remaining: 1200 - 480 = 720. Correct.

Frances: 2/3 of 720. 720 divided by 3 is 240, so 2 times that is 480. Correct.

Remaining after Frances: 720 - 480 = 240. Correct.

So, yes, Skyler invested $240.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $240.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 2/5 of 1200 is 480, then 2/3 of 720 is 480, so 480 plus 480 is 960, and 1200 minus 960 is 240. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 240 is Skyler's investment.

Wait, that seems right. So, yeah, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $240.
