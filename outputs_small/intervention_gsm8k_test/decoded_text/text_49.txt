Q: Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Richard living in an apartment building. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says the building has 15 floors. Each floor has 8 units. So, I think I need to find the total number of units in the building first. That makes sense because if I know how many units are occupied and how many are unoccupied, I can find the answer.

So, if there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units should be 5 multiplied by 8. Let me write that down:

Total units = Number of floors × Units per floor
Total units = 15 × 8

Hmm, 15 times 8. Let me calculate that. 10 times 8 is 80, and 5 times 8 is 40, so 80 plus 40 is 128. So, the building has 128 units in total.

But, that seems right. 15 floors, each with 8 units, so 15×8=128. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the problem also says that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, I need to find out how many units are occupied and then subtract that from the total to find the unoccupied units.

So, first, let's find the number of occupied units. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then:

Occupied units = (3/4) × Total units
Occupied units = (3/4) × 128

Let me compute that. 128 divided by 4 is 32, and 32 multiplied by 3 is 96. So, 3/4 of 128 is 96. So, 96 units are occupied.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 128 divided by 4 is 32, so 32×3 is 96. Yeah, that's correct.

So, if the total units are 128 and 96 are occupied, then the unoccupied units would be:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 128 - 96

Let me subtract that. 128 minus 96. Hmm, 128 minus 90 is 38, and then minus 6 more is 32. So, 128 -96=32.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. 96 plus 32 is 128. Yes, that's correct.

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Total units: 15 floors ×8 units per floor=128 units.

2. Occupied units: 3/4 of 128=96 units.

3. Unoccupied units:128-96=32 units.

Yes, that all adds up. So, I think 32 is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the unoccupied units directly without finding the occupied ones. Since 3/4 is occupied, then 1/4 must be unoccupied. So, maybe I can compute 1/4 of 128.

Let me try that. 128 divided by 4 is 32. So, that's another way to get the same answer. So, that's consistent.

So, whether I calculate the occupied units and subtract or calculate the unoccupied units directly, I get 32. So, that's a good check.

Therefore, I can be confident that the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 32.

**Final Answer**
The total number of unoccupied units in the building is \boxed{32}.

Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors, each containing 8 units. To find the total number of units in the building, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

\[
\text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 = 128
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of unoccupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. We calculate 1/4 of the total units:

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = \frac{1}{4} \times 128 = 32
\]

Thus, the
