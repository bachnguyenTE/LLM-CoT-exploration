Q: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Okay, so I have this problem here about cooking chicken, and I need to figure out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. After that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. I need to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

Hmm, let me parse this carefully. So, the oil starts at 000 degrees, takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees. After that, cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. So, the total time is the time to warm the oil to 300 degrees plus the time to warm it to 400 degrees plus the time to cook the chicken.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write this down.

First, time to warm oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes.

Then, it takes 40% longer to warm it to 400 degrees. So, the time to warm to 400 is 20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes.

After that, cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm the oil. So, the cooking time is (time to warm to 400) minus 5 minutes.

So, let me compute each part step by step.

First, time to warm oil to 300: 20 minutes.

Then, time to warm oil to 400: 20 minutes plus 40% of 20 minutes.

Let me calculate 40% of 20. 40% is 0.4 in decimal, so 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes.

So, time to warm oil to 400 is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 minutes to warm to 300, then 8 minutes more to warm to 400. So, 28 minutes total to warm the oil to 400 degrees.

Then, cooking the chicken takes 5 minutes less than that. So, 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

So, total time is 20 (to warm to 300) + 28 (to warm to 400) + 23 (cooking chicken) = 20 + 28 + 23.

Let me add that up: 20 + 28 is 48, and 48 + 23 is 71. So, total time is 71 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

First, 20 minutes to warm oil to 300. Then, 40% longer to warm to 400. So, 40% of 20 is 8, so 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to warm to 400. Then, cooking takes 5 minutes less than that, so 28 - 5 = 23 minutes. So, 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 minutes. Hmm, 20 + 28 is 48, plus 23 is 71. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total time is 71 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 minutes to warm to 300, then 28 minutes to warm to 400, then 23 minutes to cook. So, 20 + 28 + 23 is 71. So, 71 minutes total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 71 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I interpreted the problem correctly.

It says: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. Then, it takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

So, the first part is 20 minutes to warm to 300. Then, 40% longer to warm to 400. So
