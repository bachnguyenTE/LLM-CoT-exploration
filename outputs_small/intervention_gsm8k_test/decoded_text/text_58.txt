Q: Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?

Okay, so Stephen ordered some groceries online, and his final bill came out to $40.00. But, that seems right. Let me try to figure out how he ended up paying that amount. Hmm, the problem says that because it was through a delivery vendor, they added a 25% fee to his final total and then charged him $3.00 in delivery fees. Also, Stephen added a $4.00 tip. After all these extra fees, what was the final price?

Wait, that seems right. So, the $40.00 is the total after all fees. But, that seems right. Let me parse the problem again.
