Q: The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Polly and the dragon Perg. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the dragon is at Farbo, and it's breathing fire at anything within 1000 feet. Polly is holding a sapphire gemstone, and when she holds it, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than when she isn't holding it. So, when she's not holding the gemstone, the javelin can go 400 feet. When she holds it, it's three times that distance, right? So, 400 feet times 3 is 1200 feet. 

Wait, that seems right. So, without the gemstone, the javelin can reach 400 feet, and with it, it can reach 1200 feet. But, that seems right. So, the question is asking, if Polly holds the gemstone, how far outside of the dragon's reach can she stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin. 

Hmm, so I think this is about the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still be able to hit it with the javelin. So, when she's not holding the gemstone, the javelin can reach 400 feet. When she's holding it, it can reach 1200 feet. So, the question is, how much farther can she stand and still hit the dragon? 

Wait, that seems right. So, the dragon is at 1000 feet. So, if Polly is holding the gemstone, she can reach 1200 feet. So, the question is, how far outside of the dragon's reach can she stand? So, the dragon is at 1000 feet, and Polly can reach up to 1200 feet. So, the difference between 1200 and 1000 is 200 feet. So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit it. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 200 feet. 

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, without the gemstone, she can reach 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can reach 1200 feet. So, the maximum distance she can stand is 1200 feet, and the dragon is at 1000 feet. So, the difference is 200 feet. So, she can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit it. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 200 feet. 

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer. 

**Final Answer**
The distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's reach is \boxed{200} feet.

Polly can throw the gold javelin three times farther when she holds the sapphire gemstone. Without the gemstone, the javelin can reach 400 feet, so with the gemstone, it can reach \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) feet. The dragon is at 1000 feet. 

The difference between the maximum distance Polly can reach with the gemstone and the dragon's reach is \(1200 - 1000 = 200\) feet. 

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it.

\[
\boxed{200}
