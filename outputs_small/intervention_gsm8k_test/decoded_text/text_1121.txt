Q: In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. I need to figure out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in seven days. That means if I know how much Brian walks, Sofie walks double that amount. But, that seems right. So, Sofie's total distance is double Brian's total distance over the same period.

Sofie's daily walking distance is given as 10 miles. So, if I can find out how much Brian walks each day, I can then multiply that by seven days to get his total distance.

Wait, that seems right. So, if Sofie walks twice as much as Brian, then Brian's daily distance must be half of Sofie's daily distance. Let me write that down.

Let me denote Brian's daily walking distance as B. Then, Sofie's daily walking distance is 2B. But, that seems right. So, Sofie's daily distance is twice Brian's. So, if Sofie walks 10 miles a day, then Brian walks half of that, which is 5 miles a day.

So, Brian walks 5 miles each day. Then, over seven days, Brian would walk 5 miles/day multiplied by 7 days. Let me calculate that.

5 miles/day * 7 days = 35 miles.

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Brian walks 5 miles a day, then over seven days, that's 5*7=35 miles. Sofie walks twice that, so 10 miles a day, which is 10*7=70 miles. So, in seven days, Sofie walks 70 miles, and Brian walks 35 miles. So, 70 is twice 35, which fits the condition given in the problem.

So, that seems to check out. So, the answer is 35 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I can set up an equation. Let me denote Brian's total distance in seven days as B. Then, Sofie's total distance is 2B. Sofie's total distance is also 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles. So, 2B = 70. Therefore, B = 35 miles. So, that's another way to get the same answer.

So, that's consistent. So, whether I think about it per day or in total, I get the same result. So, that gives me more confidence that 35 miles is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that Brian walks 35 miles in seven days.

**Final Answer**
Brian will walk \boxed{35} miles in seven days.

Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in seven days. Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. To find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by noting that Sofie's daily walking distance is twice that of Brian's. 

Let \( B \) be Brian's daily walking distance. Then, Sofie's daily walking distance is \( 2B \). Since Sofie walks 10 miles each day, we have:
\[ 2B = 10 \]
Solving for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ miles per day} \]

Brian's total walking distance over seven days is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk \boxed{35} miles in seven days.
