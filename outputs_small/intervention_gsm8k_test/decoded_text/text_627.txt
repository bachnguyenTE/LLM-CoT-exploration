Q: On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.

Okay, so I have this problem here about a tow truck pulling cars over the course of a week. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that on a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days. I need to calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me break down the information given. The tow truck did ten cars each day for the first three days. Then, for the remaining days, it pulled four fewer cars each day. I need to figure out how many days are left after the first three days in a week. Well, a week has seven days, right? So, if the first three days are done, that leaves four more days. So, the tow truck pulled ten cars each day for three days and then six cars each day for the next four days. Wait, that seems right. Let me confirm: 3 days at ten cars each, and 4 days at six cars each. Yeah, that adds up to seven days in total.

So, to find the total number of cars towed, I need to calculate the number of cars for the first three days and then add that to the number of cars for the remaining four days. Let me write that down.

First, for the first three days: 10 cars/day * 3 days. That should be straightforward. 10 times 3 is 30 cars. Okay, so that's 30 cars.

Then, for the remaining four days: 6 cars/day * 4 days. Wait, that seems right. Because if the first three days were ten cars each, then each subsequent day is four fewer, so 10 - 4 = 6. So, 6 cars per day for four days. So, 6 times 4 is 24 cars.

Now, to find the total number of cars towed that week, I need to add the cars from the first three days and the cars from the last four days. So, 30 cars + 24 cars. Wait, that seems right. 30 plus 24 is 54. So, 54 cars in total.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First three days: 10 cars each day, so 10*3=30. That seems correct. Then, the remaining four days: 6 cars each day, so 6*4=24. Adding those together: 30 +24=54. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of cars towed that week is 54. Hmm, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem to verify.

Alternatively, I can think of the number of cars per day as a sequence. The first three days are 10, 10, 10. Then, the next four days are 6, 6, 6, 6. So, adding all those together: 10+10+10+6+6+6+6. Let me add them step by step.

First, 10+10=20, plus another 10 is 30. Then, 6+6=12, plus another 6 is 18, plus another 6 is 24. So, 30 +24=54. Yep, same result. So, that seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the number of cars per day is decreasing by 4 each day after the first three days, it's an arithmetic sequence with the first term a1=10, common difference d=-4, and number of terms n=7.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d). Let me plug in the numbers.

So, n=7, a1=10, d=-4.

S_7 = 7/2 * (2*10 + (7-1)*(-4)).

Calculating inside the parentheses first: 2*10=20, and (7-1)*(-4)=6*(-4)=-24. So, 20 + (-24)= -4.

So, S_7=7/2 * (-4)= (7/2)*(-4)=7*(-2)= -14. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
