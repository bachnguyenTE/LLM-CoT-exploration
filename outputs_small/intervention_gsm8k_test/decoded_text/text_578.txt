Q: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the final value of the number train. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down step by step. First, the starting value is 20. Then, we have some operations involving this starting value. Let me write this out in my mind.

First, the starting value is 20. Then, we add half of the number to this starting value. Wait, that seems right. So, half the number... but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, half the number... but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, half of the number... but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, half of the number is 20 divided by 2, which is 10. So, half the number is 10? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, half of 20 is 10. So, adding that to the starting value: 20 + 10. That would be 31. Hmm, okay.

Then, that resulting value was divided by 5. So, 31 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 31 divided by 5 is 6.2. Hmm, okay. So, 31 divided by 5 is 6.2. So, that's the next step.

Then, the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 10. So, 10. So, now we have 6.2 multiplied by 10. Let me compute that. 6.2 times 10 is 62. So, the final value is 62.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through it again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting value is 20. Then, half the number: 20 divided by 2 is 10. Then, adding that to the starting value: 20 + 10 is 30. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
