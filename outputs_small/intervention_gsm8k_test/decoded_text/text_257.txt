Q: Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a redwood tree, and I need to figure out how much it weighs after the termites ate 30% of its wood. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says each solid 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Hmm, so each 10-foot piece is 400 pounds. That seems like a lot, but, that seems right. I guess redwood is pretty dense. So, if each 10-foot section is 400 pounds, I need to figure out how much the entire tree weighs before the termites ate anything.

Wait, that seems right. So, if each 10-foot section is 400 pounds, then the total weight of the tree would be the number of 10-foot sections multiplied by 400 pounds. But, that seems right. So, how many 10-foot sections are there in the entire tree?

The tree is 200 feet tall. So, if each section is 10 feet, then the number of sections is 200 divided by 10. Let me calculate that. 220 divided by 10 is 22. So, there are 22 sections of 10 feet each in the tree.

Therefore, the total weight of the tree before the termites ate anything is 22 multiplied by 400 pounds. Let me do that multiplication. 22 times 400. Hmm, 20 times 400 is 8,000, and 2 times 400 is 800. So, adding those together, 8,000 plus 800 is 8,800 pounds. So, the tree weighs 8,800 pounds before the termites ate anything.

But, that seems right. 22 sections times 400 pounds each is 8,800 pounds. Okay, so that's the total weight. Now, the termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. So, I need to find out what 30% of 8,800 pounds is and then subtract that from the total weight to find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate their share.

So, 30% of 8,800 pounds. To calculate that, I can convert 30% to a decimal, which is 0.30, and multiply it by 8,800. Let me do that. 0.30 times 8,800. Hmm, 0.3 times 8,000 is 2,400, and 0.3 times 800 is 240. So, adding those together, 2,400 plus 240 is 2,640 pounds. So, the termites ate 2,640 pounds of wood.

Therefore, the remaining weight of the tree is the total weight minus the weight the termites ate. So, 8,800 minus 2,640. Let me subtract that. 8,800 minus 2,000 is 6,800, and then minus another 640 is 6,160 pounds. So, the tree weighs 6,160 pounds after the termites ate their share.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 22 sections times 400 pounds is 8,800 pounds. 30% of 8,800 is 2,640. Subtracting that from 8,800 gives 6,160. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If each 10-foot section is 400 pounds, and the tree is 22 sections, then 22 times 400 is 8,800. Then, 30% is 0.3 times 8,800, which is 2,640. So, 8,800 minus 2,640 is 6,160. Yeah, that seems consistent.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe instead of calculating the total weight first, I could calculate the weight per foot and then multiply by the total height. Let me try that.

Each 10-foot section is 400 pounds, so per foot, that's 400 divided by 10, which is 40 pounds per foot. So, each foot weighs 4
