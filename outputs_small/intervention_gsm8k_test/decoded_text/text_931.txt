Q: The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. I need to find Peter's age. Hmm, let me see. The problem also gives me two pieces of information: Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. Wait, that seems right. Let me try to parse this step by step.

First, let me note down what I know:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, if I let P be Peter's age, J be Jean's age, and Paul be Paul's age, then P + J + Paul + Jean = 100. Wait, that seems right.
