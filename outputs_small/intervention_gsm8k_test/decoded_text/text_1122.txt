Q: A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a toy manufacturer receiving an order for 400 toys. There are 5 workers available to work on the order. Two of them produce 6 toys each hour, and the other two produce 4 toys each hour. All workers work for 10 hours during their shift. By the end of the shift, they still need another 20 toys to ship the order. The question is asking how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the total order is 400 toys. But, that seems right. Then, they have 5 workers. Two of them are faster, making 6 toys per hour, and the other two are slower, making 4 toys per hour. So, I think I need to calculate how many toys each group of workers can produce in 10 hours and then see how many toys are still needed after that.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write down the information:

- Total order: 400 toys
- Number of workers: 5
- Two workers: 6 toys/hour each
- Two workers: 4 toys/hour each
- One worker: unknown, let's call this 'x' toys/hour
- Shift duration: 10 hours
- After the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship, so they have already produced 400 - 22 = 378 toys.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total toys produced by all workers in 10 hours is 378. So, I can calculate the total production from the first four workers and then find out how much the fifth worker needs to produce.

Let me compute the production from the first four workers:

- Two workers making 6 toys/hour: 2 workers * 6 toys/hour = 12 toys/hour
- Two workers making 4 toys/hour: 2 workers * 4 toys/hour = 8 toys/hour
- So, total production from the first four workers: 12 + 8 = 20 toys/hour

Then, over 10 hours, the first four workers produce: 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys

So, the fifth worker needs to produce the remaining toys. The total needed is 400, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
