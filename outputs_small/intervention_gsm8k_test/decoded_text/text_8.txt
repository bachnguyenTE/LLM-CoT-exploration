Q: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John driving and trying to get home. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what's happening. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something. Then he tries to get home, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. He turns around, so he's driving back towards home. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he's driving away from home for 3 hours, then turns around and starts driving back towards home. But, that seems right. So, he's going to be moving away from home for 3 hours, then moving towards home for 4 hours. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he's driving away for 3 hours, then turns around, so he's moving towards home for 4 hours. But, that seems right. So, the total time is 7 hours? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
