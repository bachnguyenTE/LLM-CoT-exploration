Q: Doctor Jones is scheduling his time for Monday. He is spending nine hours at the clinic where he works that day. He has to do rounds to check on inpatients staying at the clinic, which takes twenty minutes per inpatient, and he has ten appointments, which take thirty minutes each. How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records on Monday. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Doctor Jones is working a total of nine hours at the clinic. He has two main activities that take time: rounds to check inpatients and ten appointments. Each inpatient visit takes twenty minutes, and each appointment takes thirty minutes. He has nine inpatients, and we need to find out how much time he has left for updating his records.

Alright, let's list out the information:

- Total time available: 9 hours
- Time per inpatient: 20 minutes
- Number of inpatients: 9
- Time per appointment: 30 minutes
- Number of appointments: 10

So, the first thing I need to do is calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on the inpatient rounds and the total time he spends on all the appointments. Then, I can subtract both of these from the total available time to find out how much time is left for updating his records.

Let me start with the inpatient rounds. Each inpatient takes 20 minutes, which is 20 minutes. He has 9 inpatients. So, the total time for inpatient rounds is 9 multiplied by 20 minutes.

Calculating that: 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. 9 times 20 is 180 minutes. Hmm, 20 minutes per inpatient, 9 times that is 180 minutes. Okay, that's correct.

Now, moving on to the appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes, and he has 10 appointments. So, the total time for appointments is 10 multiplied by 30 minutes.

Calculating that: 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

So, the total time spent on all activities is the sum of the inpatient rounds and the appointments. That would be 180 minutes + 300 minutes.

Adding those together: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. 180 plus 300 is 480 minutes. So, total time spent is 480 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes = 180 minutes.

Appointments: 10 appointments *30 minutes = 300 minutes.

Total time: 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the total time available is 9 hours. I need to convert that into minutes to make the subtraction easier. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 9 hours is 9 *60 = 540 minutes.

So, total available time: 540 minutes.

Total time spent: 480 minutes.

Therefore, the time left for updating records is 540 - 480 = 60 minutes.

60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total time available: 9 hours = 540 minutes.

Inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients *20 minutes = 180 minutes.

Appointments:10 *30 = 300 minutes.

Total time used:180 +300 =480 minutes.

Time left:540 -480 =60 minutes =1 hour.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can also calculate the time left in hours directly.

Total time available:9 hours.

Total time used:480 minutes.

Convert 480 minutes to hours:480 /60=8 hours.

Wait, that seems right. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 480 minutes is 8 hours.

So, 9 hours total -8 hours used=1 hour left.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 1 hour.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
</think>

Doctor Jones has a total of 9 hours available at the clinic. He needs to account for the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

1. Calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds:
   \[
   9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time spent on appointments:
   \[
