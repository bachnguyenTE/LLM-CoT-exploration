Q: Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes and a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. How many pounds of carrots did Daisy buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Daisy buying some potatoes, sweet potatoes, and carrots. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. That seems straightforward. So, potatoes = 5 pounds. Got that down.

Next, it says she bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. Hmm, okay. So, sweet potatoes are twice the weight of the potatoes. Since the potatoes are 5 pounds, sweet potatoes would be 2 times 5. Let me write that down: sweet potatoes = 2 * 5. That equals 10 pounds. So, sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds. That makes sense.

Now, the problem also mentions a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, carrots are 3 pounds less than sweet potatoes. Since sweet potatoes are 10 pounds, carrots would be 10 - 3. Let me calculate that: 10 - 3 = 7. So, carrots weigh 7 pounds. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Potatoes: 5 pounds. Sweet potatoes: 2 times that, so 10 pounds. Carrots: 3 pounds fewer than sweet potatoes, so 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. 2 times 5 is definitely 10, and 10 minus 3 is 7. So, the carrots are 7 pounds. 

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using variables or something. Let me try that to double-check.

Let me denote the weight of potatoes as P. So, P = 5 pounds. Sweet potatoes are 2 times as much, so S = 2P. Substituting P, S = 2*5 = 10 pounds. Carrots are 3 pounds fewer than sweet potatoes, so C = S - 3. Substituting S, C = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. Yep, same result. 

Alternatively, I could think about it in terms of equations. Let me write them out:

Potatoes: P = 5

Sweet potatoes: S = 2P

Carrots: C = S - 3

So, substituting P into the equation for S: S = 2*5 =10

Then substituting S into the equation for C: C =10 -3 =7

So, all right, that's consistent. 

I think I'm confident that the answer is 7 pounds. It all adds up correctly. 

Just to make sure, let me visualize it. If the potatoes are 5, sweet potatoes are double that, so 10. Carrots are 3 less than 10, so 7. Yeah, that makes sense. 

I don't think I need to consider any other factors here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just a matter of translating the words into mathematical expressions and solving step by step. 

So, in summary, the steps are:

1. Identify the weight of potatoes: 5 pounds.

2. Calculate the weight of sweet potatoes: 2 times the weight of potatoes, which is 10 pounds.

3. Calculate the weight of carrots: 3 pounds less than the weight of sweet potatoes, which is 7 pounds.

Therefore, the answer is 7 pounds of carrots.

**Final Answer**
The number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is \boxed{7}.

Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
\]

The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is \boxed{7}.
