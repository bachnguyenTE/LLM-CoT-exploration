Okay, so Bill is buying a new two-ton truck, and he's got a bunch of extra features he wants. Let me try to figure out how much this will cost him. Hmm, the base price is $30,000. Wait, that seems right. So, the base is 30,000 dollars. Then, there are several extra features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. Each of these has different costs, and some are extra, some are not. 

First, let me list out all the extra features and their respective costs. The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500. Okay, so that's straightforward. Then, the other features are at extra cost, but, that seems right. So, the king cab is an extra, so that's 7,500. Then, the other features: a towing package, which is at extra cost, but, that seems right. Then, leather seats, which are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. Hmm, okay, so if the king cab is 7,500, then one-third of that would be... Let me calculate that. 

One-third of 7,500 is 7,500 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 7,500 divided by 3. 3 goes into 7 two times, which is 6, remainder 1. Bring down the 5, making it 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. Bring down the 0, 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, that's 2,500. So, the cost of the leather seats is 2,500. Okay, that's one-third of the king cab upgrade.

Next, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. So, if the leather seats are 2,500, then running boards are 2,500 minus 500. That's 2,000. So, running boards are 2,000. Got that.

Then, the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500. So, that's straightforward. So, now, let me list all the extra costs:

- King cab upgrade: 7,500
- Towing package: Hmm, wait, that seems right. Is the towing package an extra cost? The problem says "several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package." So, all of these are extra features, so they are all at extra cost. So, the king cab is 7,500, the others are as I calculated.

So, the total extra cost is the sum of all these. So, let's add them up.

First, king cab: 7,500

Towing package: Hmm, wait, that seems right. Is the towing package an extra cost? The problem says "several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package,..." So, yes, all of these are extra. So, the king cab is 7,500, the towing package is an extra, the leather seats are 2,500, running boards are 2,000, and the exterior light package is 1,500.

So, let me add them all together:

7,500 (king cab) + 2,500 (leather seats) + 2,000 (running boards) + 1,500 (exterior light package). Wait, that seems right. Let me add them step by step.

First, 7,500 + 2,500. That's 10,000. Then, 10,000 + 2,000 is 12,000. Then, 12,000 + 1,500 is 13,500. So, the total extra cost is 13,500.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check:

King cab: 7,500

Leather seats: 2,500

Running boards: 2,000

Exterior light: 1,500

Adding them up:

7,500 + 2,500 = 10,000

10,000 + 2,000 = 12,000

12,000 + 1,500 = 13,500

Yes, that's correct. So, the total extra cost is
