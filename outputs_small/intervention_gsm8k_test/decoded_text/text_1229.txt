Q: In November, a toy was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the price of a toy over three months: November, December, and January. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the toy was priced at $40 in November. That seems straightforward. Then, in December, the price increased by 80%. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate what the new price is after an 80% increase. I remember that to find a percentage increase, you take the original amount, multiply it by the percentage (converted to decimal), and then add that to the original amount. 

So, 80% as a decimal is 0.8. Let me write that down:

Original price in November: $40.

Percentage increase in December: 80% = 0.8.

So, the increase amount is 40 * 0.8. Let me compute that. 40 times 0.8. Hmm, 40 * 0.8 is the same as 40 * 8/10, which is 32. So, the increase is $32. 

Wait, that seems right. So, adding that to the original price: 40 + 32 = 72. So, the price in December is $72. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, moving on to January. The price decreased by 50%. So, I need to find 50% of the December price and subtract that from the December price. 

First, let me figure out what 50% of $72 is. 50% as a decimal is 0.5. So, 72 * 0.5. Let me compute that. 72 * 0.5 is 36. So, the decrease is $36.

Subtracting that from the December price: 72 - 36 = 36. So, the price in January is $36.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with November: $40. Then, 80% increase. 80% of 40 is 0.8 * 40. Let me compute that again. 0.8 * 40 is 32. So, adding that to 40 gives 72. That's correct.

Then, 50% decrease from 72. 50% of 72 is 0.5 * 72 = 36. So, subtracting 36 from 72 gives 36. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the final price in January is $36.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions instead of decimals? Let me try that.

80% increase is the same as multiplying by 1 + 0.8 = 1.8. So, 40 * 1.8. Let me compute that. 40 * 1.8. 40 * 1 is 40, and 40 * 0.8 is 32. So, 40 + 32 = 72. That's the same as before.

Then, a 50% decrease is multiplying by 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. So, 72 * 0.5 = 36. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe using fractions for the percentages. 80% is 4/5, so 40 + (4/5)*40. Let me compute that. (4/5)*40 is (4*40)/5 = 176/5 = 35.2. So, 40 + 35.2 = 75.2. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
