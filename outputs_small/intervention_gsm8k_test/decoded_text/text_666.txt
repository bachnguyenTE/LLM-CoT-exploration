Q: Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. Arelia has $120. The question is asking how much each of them would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out what I know:

1. Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy.
2. Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia.
3. Arelia has $120.

So, we have four people: Rayna, Kassidy, Aurelia, and Arelia. Each has some amount of money, and we need to find out how much each would have if they combine their money and split it equally.

Let me assign variables to each person's money to make it easier. Let's say:

- R = Rayna's money
- K = Kassidy's money
- A = Aurelia's money
- Ar = Arelia's money

From the problem, we know:

1. R = K + 60
2. K = (3/4) * A
3. Ar = 120

So, we have three equations here. But, that seems right. Now, we need to find R, K, A, and Ar. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, we have four variables, but, that seems right.
