Q: At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Allan's house with corn and cannoli. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannoli. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house." Hmm, so initially, there are 40 cannolis. And the corn is twice that. So, if I let the number of cannolis be C, then the corn would be 2C. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if C is 40, then corn is 2*40, which is 80. So, initially, there are 40 cannolis and 80 corns. Let me write that down:

Initial Cannoli: 40
Initial Corn: 80

Then, the problem says: "Allan bought 600 more cannoli at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannoli." Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, he bought 60 more cannoli, so the new number of cannoli is 40 + 60. Wait, that seems right. 40 + 60 is 104. So, now he has 144 cannoli? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
