Q: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Okay, so I have this problem about three little wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. They all live in a forest and howl at the moon every night. The question is asking for the combined length of time their howls last, in minutes. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. It says that Tobias howls, and each howl lasts 20 seconds. So, that's straightforward. Then, Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, if I can figure out how long Chikote's howl is, I can add that to the total. And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, Igneous's howl duration is equal to the sum of Tobias and Chikote's howl durations.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. Let me assign variables to each of their howl durations. Let me denote:

- Let T be the duration of Tobias's howl in seconds.
- Let C be the duration of Chikote's howl in seconds.
- Let I be the duration of Igneous's howl in seconds.

From the problem, I know that:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Wait, that seems right. So, T = 20 seconds.

2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, C = 2 * T.

3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. So, I = T + C.

So, let me compute each of these step by step.

First, T is given as 20 seconds. So, T = 20 seconds.

Next, Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's. So, C = 2 * T. Since T is 20, then C = 2 * 20. Let me compute that: 2 * 20 is 40. So, C = 40 seconds.

Then, Igneous's howl is equal to the sum of the other two. So, I = T + C. We have T as 20 and C as 40, so I = 20 + 40. That's 60 seconds. So, I = 60 seconds.

So, now, we have all three howl durations:

- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Now, the question is asking for the combined length of time of their howls. So, we need to add up all three durations.

Let me compute that: 20 + 40 + 60. Let me add 20 and 40 first. 20 + 40 is 60. Then, 60 + 60 is 120. So, the total combined duration is 120 seconds.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Tobias: 20 seconds. Correct.

Chikote: twice as long as Tobias. 20 * 2 is 40. Correct.

Igneous: sum of Tobias and Chikote. 20 + 40 is 60. Correct.

Total: 20 + 40 +60. 20+40 is 60, plus 60 is 120. So, 120 seconds in total.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 20, 40, 60. 20+40 is 60, plus 60 is 120. So, 120 seconds.

But, that seems right. So, 120 seconds is the total duration.

But, that seems right. So, the question is asking for the combined length of time in minutes. So, I need to convert 120 seconds into minutes.

Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, so to convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60.

So, 120 seconds divided by 60 is 2 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. 120 divided by 60 is 2. Because 60 * 2 is 120.

So, 120 seconds is equal to 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of their howls is 2 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

So, T = 20, C = 40, I = 60. Total is 120 seconds. 120 divided by 60 is
