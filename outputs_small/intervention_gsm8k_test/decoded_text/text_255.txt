Q: Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally, putting an equal number of the new cows into each of the twenty stalls. How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about cows in stalls. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, there are ten stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, I can calculate the total number of cows initially. That should be 10 stalls multiplied by 20 cows per stall. Let me write that down:

Total cows initially = 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows.

Alright, so there are 220 cows in total. Wait, that seems right. 10 stalls times 20 cows each is 200 cows. Okay, got that.

Now, Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Hmm, so he's buying 40 more cows. Let me add that to the initial total. So, 220 cows + 40 cows = 264 cows. Wait, that seems right. 220 plus 40 is 264. So, now the total number of cows is 264.

He then divides these 40 cows equally among the 20 stalls. So, he's adding 40 cows over 20 stalls. I need to figure out how many cows go into each stall. So, that would be 40 cows divided by 20 stalls. Let me calculate that.

40 divided by 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 40 twice, right? Because 20 times 2 is 40. So, 40 divided by 20 is 2. So, each stall gets 2 cows. Wait, that seems right. So, each stall now has 2 cows from the new ones.

But, that seems right. So, each stall originally had 20 cows, and now they get 2 more. So, each stall now has 22 cows. Let me check that.

Original per stall: 20 cows. New per stall: 2 cows. So, 20 + 2 = 22. Yes, that's correct.

So, now, the question is asking how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, if each stall now has 22 cows, then 8 stalls would have 8 times 22 cows.

Let me compute that. 8 * 22. 8 times 20 is 160, and 8 times 2 is 16, so 160 + 16 is 176. So, 8 stalls have 76 cows.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Ten stalls, 20 cows each: 10 * 20 = 200 cows.
2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows: 200 + 40 = 240 cows.
3. Divides 40 cows equally into 20 stalls: 40 /20 = 2 cows per stall.
4. So, each stall now has 20 + 2 = 22 cows.
5. 8 stalls have 8 *22 = 176 cows.

Yes, that all adds up. So, the answer should be 176 cows.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as total cows after the purchase and then find the number per stall.

Total cows after purchase: 200 +40=240.

Number of stalls: still 10 stalls.

So, cows per stall: 240 /10=24 cows per stall.
