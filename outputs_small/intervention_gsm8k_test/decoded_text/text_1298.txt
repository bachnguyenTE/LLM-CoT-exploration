Q: Justin has a jar with many coins in it. The jar has 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. What is the total dollar amount in the jar?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Justin has a jar with a bunch of coins, and I need to figure out how much money is in the jar in total. The coins are quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Let me see, I remember that each type of coin has a different value, so I need to calculate the total value for each type and then add them all together. 

First, let me list out the number of each type of coin and their respective values. Quarters are worth 25 cents, dimes are 10 cents, nickels are 5 cents, and pennies are 1 cent. Since the question is asking for the total in dollars, I should convert each total amount from cents to dollars at the end, or maybe just work in cents and then convert at the end. Hmm, maybe working in cents is easier because I can just add them up and then divide by 100 to get dollars. Let me think about that.

So, the jar has 32 quarters. Each quarter is 25 cents, so I can calculate the total value of the quarters by multiplying 32 by 25. Let me write that down: 32 * 25. Hmm, 32 times 20 is 64, and 32 times 5 is 160, so adding those together, 64 + 160 is 124. So, the quarters are worth 124 cents. Okay, that seems right.

Next, the dimes. There are 95 dimes, each worth 10 cents. So, 95 * 10. Well, 95 times 10 is straightforward, it's 950 cents. So, the dimes add up to 950 cents. That seems a lot, but, that seems right. Let me double-check: 95 dimes, each is 10 cents, so 95*10 is 950. Yeah, that's correct.

Then, nickels. There are 120 nickels, each worth 5 cents. So, 120 * 5. Hmm, 120 times 5. Let me break that down. 100*5 is 500, 20*5 is 100, and 0*5 is 0. So, 500 + 100 is 600. So, the nickels are worth 600 cents. That seems correct.

Lastly, the pennies. There are 750 pennies, each worth 1 cent. So, 750 * 1 is 750 cents. So, the pennies are worth 750 cents. That seems a lot, but, that seems right. 750 pennies is like $7.50, which is a lot of money, but, that seems right. So, adding all these up.

So, let me list out the total cents for each type:

- Quarters: 124 cents
- Dimes: 950 cents
- Nickels: 600 cents
- Pennies: 750 cents

Now, I need to add all these together. Let me add them step by step.

First, add the quarters and dimes: 124 + 950. Let me compute that. 124 + 950. 124 + 900 is 1024, and then +50 is 1074. So, 124 + 950 is 1074 cents.

Next, add the nickels: 1074 + 600. That's straightforward, 1074 + 600. 1000 + 600 is 1700, and 74 + 0 is 74, so 1700 +74 is 1774. So, 1074 +600 is 1774 cents.

Then, add the pennies: 1774 +750. Hmm, 1774 +700 is 1874, and then +50 is 1924. So, 1774 +750 is 1924 cents.

So, the total amount in the jar is 1924 cents. But, that seems right. Let me just verify my calculations because sometimes when adding, it's easy to make a mistake.

Let me add them again:

Quarters: 32 *25 = 800? Wait, that seems right.
