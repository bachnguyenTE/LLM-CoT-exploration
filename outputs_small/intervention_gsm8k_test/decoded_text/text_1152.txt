Q: Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Mark buys two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. I need to find the probability that both tickets are winners, and express it as a percentage. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when dealing with probabilities of independent events, the probability that both events occur is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if the two events are independent, which I think they are in this case because the outcome of one doesn't affect the other, then I can multiply the probabilities together.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. I should probably convert that to a decimal to make the multiplication easier. 20% is the same as 0.2. So, the probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2.

Now, the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. That means if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second one has 3 times that. So, 3 times 20% is 60%. Let me write that down. 3 * 20% = 60%. So, the probability of the second ticket winning is 0.6.

Wait, that seems right. If the first ticket is 20%, then the second is three times that, so 20% * 3 = 60%. So, 0.6 in decimal form.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, I need to multiply the two probabilities together. So, 0.2 (for the first ticket) multiplied by 0.6 (for the second ticket). Let me do that multiplication.

0.2 * 0.6. Hmm, 0.2 is the same as 1/5, and 0.6 is the same as 3/5. So, multiplying 1/5 by 3/5 gives 3/25. Converting that back to decimal, 3 divided by 25 is 0.12. So, 0.12 in decimal form.

To express this as a percentage, I just multiply by 100. So, 0.12 * 100 = 12%. So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. First ticket: 20% chance. Second ticket: three times more likely, so 60%. Multiply 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12, which is 12%. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was understanding that the second ticket is three times more likely, so I multiplied the first probability by 3. Then, since the two events are independent, I multiplied the two probabilities together. Converting percentages to decimals was the right step, and multiplying 0.2 and 0.6 gave me 0.12, which is 12%, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
