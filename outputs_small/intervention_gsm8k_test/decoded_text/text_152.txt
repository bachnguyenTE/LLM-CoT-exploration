Q: Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack of cookies has six cookies inside. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pay with a $10 bill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cookies Carl bought. He purchased ten packs, and each pack contains six cookies. So, I'll multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack: 10 packs × 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so I'll multiply the number of cookies by the cost per cookie: 60 cookies × $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

Carl paid with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he should receive, I'll subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid: $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

Therefore, Carl should receive $4.00 in change.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   
   Carl bought **10 packs** of cookies, and each pack contains **6 cookies**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Determine the total cost of the cookies:**
   
   Each cookie costs **\$0.10**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the change Carl receives:**
   
   Carl paid with a **\$10 bill**.
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$4.00}
\]
