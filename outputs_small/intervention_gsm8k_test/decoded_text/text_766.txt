Q: Marissa bought a ball at the store for $20. If she had $80 on her and used the rest of the money to buy her brother Jimmy, candy bars sold at $5 each, how many candy bars did Marissa buy for Jimmy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Marissa bought a ball for $20, and she had $80 on her own. She used the rest of her money to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy, which are sold at $5 each. The question is asking how many candy bars she bought for Jimmy. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to figure out how much money Marissa has left after buying the ball. She started with $80 and spent $20 on the ball. So, I should subtract the cost of the ball from her initial amount. That would be $80 minus $20. Let me write that down:

$80 - $20 = ?

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, $80 minus $20 is $60. So, Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, she wants to use this remaining $60 to buy candy bars. Each candy bar costs $5. So, the question is, how many candy bars can she buy with $60? Hmm, this is a division problem, I think. So, I need to divide the total amount of money she has left by the cost per candy bar.

So, that would be $60 divided by $5 per candy bar. Let me write that as:

$60 ÷ $5 = ?

Hmm, let me calculate that. 5 goes into 6 once, with a remainder of 1. Then, bring down the 0, making it 10. 5 goes into 10 twice. So, that would be 12. So, 5 times 12 is 60. So, $60 divided by $5 is 12. So, Marissa can buy 12 candy bars with her remaining $60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. If each candy bar is $5, then 12 candy bars would be 10 dollars, and 2 candy bars would be 10 dollars, so 10 plus 10 is 20.
