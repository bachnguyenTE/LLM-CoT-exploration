Q: Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School, the neighboring school, enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the enrollment at two high schools, Norman High School and Butler High School. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. Hmm, okay, so I need to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School.

Let me break it down. If Norman has 4000 students, and Butler has 3/4 of that, I should calculate 3/4 of 4000 to find out how many students Butler has. Then, subtract that number from 4000 to see the difference. That should give me the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that out. 

First, calculate 3/4 of 4000. To do that, I can multiply 4000 by 3 and then divide by 4, or maybe divide 4000 by 4 first and then multiply by 3. Either way, it should give the same result. Let me try both methods to make sure I get the same answer.

Method 1: Multiply first, then divide.
3/4 of 4000 is (4000 * 3) / 4. Let's compute 4000 * 3 first. 4000 * 3 is 12,000. Then, divide that by 4. 12,000 divided by 4 is 3,000. So, Butler has 3,000 students.

Method 2: Divide first, then multiply.
Divide 4000 by 4 first. 4000 / 4 is 1,000. Then, multiply that by 3. 1,000 * 3 is 3,000. Same result. Good, so both methods work.

Now, to find out how much greater Norman's enrollment is than Butler's, I subtract the number of students at Butler from the number at Norman. So, 4000 - 3000. Let me do that subtraction.

4000 minus 3000 is 1000. So, the difference is 1000 students. That means Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School on average.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with 4000 students for Norman. 3/4 of that is 3/4 * 4000. 4000 divided by 4 is 1000, and 1000 times 3 is 3000. So, yes, that's correct. Then, subtracting 3000 from 4000 gives 1000. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using fractions. If 3/4 of Norman's enrollment is Butler's, then the difference is 1 - 3/4, which is 1/4. So, the difference is 1/4 of Norman's enrollment. 1/4 of 4000 is 1000. Yep, same answer. That's a good check.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 1000 students. Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than that at Butler High School.

**Final Answer**
The average enrollment at Norman High School is \boxed{1000} greater than that at Butler High School.

Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. To find how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first calculate the enrollment at Butler High School.

Calculating \(\frac{3}{4}\) of 4000:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{4000 \times 3}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference between the enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is \(\boxed{100
