Q: Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pies over two days. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. Then, on Sunday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Saturday. Wait, that seems right. So, if he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, then on Sunday, he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. On Saturday, gingerbread: 10 boxes. On Sunday, gingerbread: 5 more than Saturday. So, 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. Got it. So, on Saturday, gingerbread:10, Sunday:15. And apple pie: on Saturday, he sold 4 fewer than Sunday. So, if Sunday's apple pie was, let's see, if he sold 6 boxes on Sunday, then on Saturday, he sold 6 - 4 = 2 boxes of apple pie. Wait, that seems right. So, Saturday: apple pie:2, Sunday:6.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me tabulate this:

- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple pie: 2 boxes

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes
  - Apple pie: 6 boxes

Okay, that seems consistent. Let me verify the numbers again. On Saturday, gingerbread:10, apple pie:2. On Sunday, gingerbread:5 more than Saturday, so 10 +5=15. Apple pie:4 fewer than Sunday, so 15 -4=11? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
