Okay, so I have this problem here where Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. The question is asking how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how much meat Prince sells each day. He sells 15kg every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, I think I should multiply the hourly sales by the number of hours he works each day.

Let me write that down: 15kg/hour * 10 hours/day. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150. So, Prince sells 150kg of meat each day. Wait, that seems right. 15kg per hour times 10 hours is 150kg per day.

Now, the bull weighs 750kg. So, I need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all 750kg of meat. Since he sells 150kg each day, I can divide the total weight by his daily sales.

So, 750kg divided by 150kg per day. Let me do that division. 750 divided by 150. Hmm, 150 goes into 750 exactly 5 times because 150 times 5 is 750. So, 750 divided by 150 is 5. So, that would mean it takes 5 days for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 15kg per hour times 10 hours is 150kg per day. 150 times 5 is 750kg. Yep, that adds up. So, 5 days is the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to first find the daily sales and then divide the total weight by that number. It's a straightforward division problem once you break it down step by step.

Just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If Prince sells 15kg each hour, and he works 10 hours a day, that's 150kg per day. So, each day, he's reducing the bull's weight by 150kg. Starting from 750kg, how many times does 150 go into 750? Well, 150 times 5 is 750, so yes, 5 days.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 750 divided by 150. Since both numbers end with a zero, I can simplify the division by removing them. So, 75 divided by 15 is 5. That also gives me 5 days. So, that's another way to confirm it.

I think I'm confident that 5 days is the correct answer. There's no trick or anything here; it's a straightforward rate problem. Just need to make sure I didn't misread the numbers or the units.

Wait, that seems right. The bull is 750kg, and Prince sells 15kg each hour. So, 15kg per hour is 150kg per day. 750 divided by 150 is 5. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I need to consider anything else here. It's a simple division problem once you figure out the daily sales. So, I think I'm done.

**Final Answer**
It will take Prince \boxed{5} days to sell all the meat from the bull.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, his daily sales are calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

The bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight by his daily sales:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Thus, it will take Prince \boxed{5} days to sell all the meat from the bull.
