Q: Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a piece. How much does the remaining cake weigh?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces. Then, Rory and her mom each have a piece. I need to figure out how much the remaining cake weighs. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the cake weighs 20 ounces in total. It's cut into 8 pieces, so each piece must be equal in weight, right? So, if the cake is divided into 8 equal parts, each piece would weigh the same. To find out how much each piece weighs, I can divide the total weight by the number of pieces. That makes sense because if you have a whole thing and you split it into equal parts, each part is a fraction of the whole.

So, let me write that down. The total weight is 20 ounces, and it's divided into 8 pieces. So, each piece would weigh 20 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 8 is... hmm, 8 goes into 20 two times because 8 times 2 is 16, and then there's 4 left over. So, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5 ounces per piece. Wait, that seems right. 8 times 2.5 is 20, so that checks out.

Now, the cake is cut into 8 pieces, and then Rory and her mom each have one piece. So, that's two pieces in total. Each piece is 2.5 ounces, so two pieces would be 2 times 2.5 ounces. Let me calculate that. 2 times 2 is 4, and 2 times 0.5 is 1, so 4 plus 1 is 5 ounces. So, together, they have 5 ounces of cake.

But, that seems right. The cake was originally 20 ounces, and they took away 5 ounces, so the remaining cake should be 20 minus 5, which is 15 ounces. Let me make sure that makes sense. If the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece is 2.5 ounces, so 8 times 2.5 is indeed 20 ounces. Then, if two pieces are taken away, that's 5 ounces, so 20 minus 5 is 15 ounces left. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the remaining cake is 15 ounces. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe instead of calculating each piece, I can think about how much cake is left after Rory and her mom have their pieces.

So, the cake is 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so 8 pieces in total. Then, two people, Rory and her mom, each have one piece. So, that's 2 pieces taken away. So, 8 minus 2 is 6 pieces remaining. Each piece is 2.5 ounces, so 6 times 2.5 is... let me calculate that. 6 times 2 is 12, and 6 times 0.5 is 3, so 12 plus 3 is 15 ounces. So, that's another way to get the same answer, 15 ounces. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as fractions. Each piece is 20 divided by 8, which is 2.5 ounces. So, two pieces are 2.5 times 2, which is 5 ounces. So, 20 minus 5 is 15 ounces. So, that's the same result.

Is there a way to represent this with equations? Let me try that. Let the total weight of the cake be W, which is 20 ounces. It's cut into N pieces, which is 8. So, each piece weighs W/N, which is 20/8, which is 2.5 ounces. Then, the number of pieces taken away is 2, so the remaining pieces are N minus 2, which is 6. Therefore, the remaining weight is (N - 2) times (W/N). Plugging in the numbers, that's (6) times (20/8), which is 6 times 2.5, which is 15 ounces.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as fractions of the total weight. Each person has a piece, so each person has 1/8 of the cake. So, two people have 2*(1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of the cake. So, the remaining cake is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the original cake. So, 3/4 of 20 ounces is...
