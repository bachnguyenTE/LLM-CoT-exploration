Q: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. Then, each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. I need to figure out how long each final piece will be. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, Marty has 100 cm of ribbon. He wants to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, I think that means he's going to divide the ribbon into 4 sections, each of the same length. To find out how long each of those parts will be, I should divide the total length by the number of parts. So, that would be 100 cm divided by 4. Let me write that down:

100 cm ÷ 4 = ?

Hmm, 100 divided by 4. Well, 4 goes into 10 two times because 4 times 2 is 8, and that leaves a remainder of 2. Then, bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times because 4 times 5 is 20. So, putting that together, it's 25 cm. So, each of the 4 parts will be 25 cm long. Let me double-check that: 4 times 25 is 100, which is correct. Okay, so that part makes sense.

Now, the next step is that each of those 25 cm pieces needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, each 25 cm piece is going to be cut into 5 smaller pieces. So, I need to find the length of each of those smaller pieces. That means I have to divide 25 cm by 5. Let me write that down:

25 cm ÷ 5 = ?

Well, 5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times because 5 times 5 is 25. So, each of those smaller pieces will be 5 cm long. Let me verify that: 5 times 5 is 25, which is correct. So, that seems right.

Wait, that seems right. So, starting with 100 cm, cutting it into 4 parts gives 25 cm each, and then cutting each 25 cm piece into 5 parts gives 5 cm each. So, each final piece is 5 cm long.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by multiplying instead of dividing? Hmm, no, because when you divide something into equal parts, you're finding the length of each part, which is the total divided by the number of parts. So, yeah, that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, I could think of it as a two-step division problem. First, 100 divided by 4 is 25, and then 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, that's another way to see it. So, 100 ÷ 4 = 25, and then 25 ÷ 5 = 5. So, the final answer is 5 cm.

Wait, that seems right. Let me visualize it. Imagine a ribbon that's 100 cm long. If I cut it into 4 equal parts, each part is 25 cm. Then, if I take one of those 25 cm pieces and cut it into 5 equal parts, each part is 5 cm. So, each final piece is 5 cm. That makes sense.

Is there a chance I could have messed up the division? Let me check 25 divided by 5. 5 times 5 is 25, so that's correct. 100 divided by 4 is 25 because 4 times 25 is 100. So, both of those divisions are correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of fractions, 100 cm is the whole. So, 1/4 of 100 cm is 25 cm, and then 1/5 of 25 cm is 5 cm. So, that's another way to see it. So, each final piece is 5 cm.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 5 cm. So, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

**Final Answer**
The length of each final cut is \boxed{5} centimeters.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 cm by 4:

\[
100 \, \! \text{cm} \div 4 = 25
