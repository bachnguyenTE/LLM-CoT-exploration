Q: Dylan needed chicken sausages and fish sausages to make sausage buns at a party. He bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. How many sausages did Dylan buy in all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Dylan buying chicken and fish sausages for a party. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. That part is straightforward. So, I know the number of chicken sausages is 38. Now, it also mentions that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Hmm, okay, so if he has 38 chicken sausages, then the number of fish sausages must be 38 plus 6. Let me write that down to make it clearer.

Number of chicken sausages = 38

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6

So, calculating that, 38 plus 6 is... let me see, 38 plus 2 is 40, and then plus 4 more is 44. So, 38 plus 6 equals 44. That means he bought 44 fish sausages.

Now, the question is asking how many sausages he bought in all. So, that means I need to add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together. 

Total sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages

Plugging in the numbers, that's 38 + 44. Let me add those together. 38 plus 40 is 78, and then plus 4 more is 82. Wait, that seems right. 38 plus 44 is 82.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 38 chicken sausages, 6 more fish, so 38 +6 is 44. Then, 38 +44 is 82. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors here. I just need to make sure I add them properly. 38 plus 44: 8 plus 4 is 12, carry over the 1, then 3 plus 4 is 7, plus the carried over 1 is 8. So, 82. Yep, that's correct.

So, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is 82. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of sausages Dylan bought is \boxed{82}.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. 

First, we calculate the number of fish sausages:
\[
38 + 6 = 44
\]

Next, we find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:
\[
38 + 44 = 82
\]

Thus, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is \(\boxed{82}\).
