Q: Damien created a currency based on bottle caps and got his friends to take part.  He finds 10 bottle caps a day on his way home and each bottle cap is worth $.25.  How much money does he make in a 30 day month?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Damien created a currency using bottle caps. Each day, he finds 10 bottle caps, and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, I need to calculate his total earnings over 30 days.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, how much money does he make each day? He gets 10 bottle caps a day, and each is worth $0.25. So, I should multiply the number of bottle caps by the value per cap.

Let me write that out: 10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap. That should give me his daily earnings.

Calculating that: 10 * 0.25. Hmm, 10 times 0.25. Well, 10 is the same as 10.00, so 10.00 * 0.25. Let me do the multiplication.

10.00 * 0.25. Let's think of 0.25 as a quarter. So, 10 bottle caps times a quarter. A quarter is $0.25, so 10 times $0.25. 10 * 0.25 is 2.50. So, he makes $2.50 each day.

Wait, that seems right. 10 times 0.25 is 2.50. So, yes, $2.50 per day.

Now, he does this for 30 days. So, I need to multiply his daily earnings by 30.

So, $2.50/day * 30 days. Let me compute that.

First, let's break it down. 2.50 * 30. Maybe I can think of 30 as 30, which is 3*10. So, 2.50 * 30 is the same as 2.50 * 3 * 10.

Calculating 2.50 * 3 first. 2.50 * 3 is 7.50. Then, multiply that by 10, which is 75.00.

So, 2.50 * 30 is 75.00. Therefore, his total earnings for 30 days are $75.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 10 bottle caps a day, each worth $0.25. So, 10 * 0.25 is indeed 2.50. Then, 2.50 * 30. 2.50 * 30. Let me do it another way.

2.50 * 30. 2.50 * 10 is 25.00, so 2.50 * 30 is 25.00 * 3, which is 75.00. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 30 days as 30 days, so 10 bottle caps each day. So, total bottle caps in 30 days would be 10 * 30 = 300 bottle caps. Each bottle cap is $0.25, so total money is 300 * 0.25.

Calculating 300 * 0.25. 0.25 is a quarter, so 300 quarters. How much is that? 100 quarters make $25.00, so 300 quarters would be 3 * 100 quarters, which is 3 * $25.00, which is $75.00.

Yes, that's the same result. So, both methods give me $75.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think the answer is $75.00.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, I can think of the daily earnings as $2.50, so over 30 days, it's 30 * 2.50. Let me compute 30 * 2.50.

30 * 2.50. Let me break it down. 30 * 2 is 60, and 30 * 0.50 is 16.60. So, 60 + 16.60 is 76.60. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
