Q: John buys a cassette with 2 songs.  The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer.  How much time was the total cassette?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John buys a cassette with two songs. The first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first. I need to figure out the total time the cassette lasts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the first song is straightforward—it's 5 minutes. The second song is a bit trickier because it says it's 60% longer than the first. So, I need to calculate what 60% of 5 minutes is and then add that to the original 5 minutes to get the total length of the second song. After that, I can add both songs together to find the total time of the cassette.

Let me write this down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. 

1. The first song is 5 minutes. That's easy.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first. So, I need to find 60% of 5 minutes and then add that to 5 minutes.

To find 60% of 5 minutes, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by 5. So, 60% is the same as 0.66 in decimal form. Let me check that: 60 divided by 100 is 0.66. Yep, that's right.

So, 0.66 multiplied by 5 minutes. Let me do that multiplication. 0.66 times 5. Hmm, 0.6 times 5 is 3, and 0.06 times 5 is 0.3, so adding those together gives 3 + 0.3 = 3.3 minutes. So, 60% of 5 minutes is 3.3 minutes.

Now, the second song is 5 minutes plus 3.3 minutes. Let me add those together. 5 + 3.3 is 8.3 minutes. So, the second song is 8.3 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, I need to add the first song and the second song together. The first song is 5 minutes, and the second is 8.3 minutes. So, 5 + 8.3 is 13.3 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First song: 5 minutes. Second song: 60% longer than 5 minutes. 60% of 5 is 3.3, so 5 + 3.3 is 8.3. Then, 5 +8.3 is 13.3. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as multiplying the first song's length by 1.60, since 60% longer means you're adding 60% of the original length. So, 5 times 1.60 is 8.0. Then, adding the original 5 minutes gives 13.0 minutes. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
