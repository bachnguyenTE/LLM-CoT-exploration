Q: A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll define the number of games lost as \( L \).

Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of games won and lost, which is \( (L + 8) + L = 22 \).

Combining like terms, I get \( 2L + 8 = 22 \).

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives \( 2L = 14 \).

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, I find that \( L = 7 \).

Therefore, the team won \( 7 + 8 = 15 \) games.

Let's determine how many games the football team won.

**Given:**
- Total games played: 22
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

**Let:**
- \( L \) = number of games lost
- \( W \) = number of games won

**Step 1: Express the number of games won in terms of games lost.**

\[
W = L + 8
\]

**Step 2: Set up the equation for total games.**

\[
W + L = 22
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \( W \) from Step 1 into the equation.**

\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

**Step 4: Combine like terms.**

\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( L \).**

\[
2L = 22 - 8 \\
2L = 14 \\
L = \frac{14}{2} \\
L = 7
\]

**Step 6: Find the number of games won.**

\[
W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
