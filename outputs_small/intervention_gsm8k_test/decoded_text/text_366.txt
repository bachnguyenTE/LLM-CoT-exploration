Q: To be promoted to the next school year, Jane takes 3 tests that together must total at least 42 points. On her first test, Jane scored 15 points, on the second test she scored 18 points. What is the minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jane wanting to be promoted to the next school year. The requirement is that she needs to score a total of at least 42 points across three tests. Let me try to figure out what she needs to score on her third test.

First, let me break down the information given. Jane has taken three tests, and the sum of all three tests must be at least 42 points. That means if I add up her scores from the first, second, and third tests, the total should be 42 or more. So, mathematically, I can represent this as:

Test 1 + Test 2 + Test 3 ≥ 42

Now, I know her scores on the first two tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, I can plug those numbers into the equation. Let me write that out:

15 (Test 1) + 18 (Test 2) + Test 3 ≥ 42

Let me add the first two tests together. 15 plus 18 is... hmm, 15 plus 10 is 26, and then 18 minus 10 is 7, so 26 plus 7 is 33. Wait, that seems right. 15 plus 18 is 33. So, now the equation becomes:

33 + Test 3 ≥ 42

Okay, so now I need to find out what Test 3 has to be so that when I add it to 33, the total is at least 42. So, I can set up the inequality as:

Test 3 ≥ 42 - 33

Let me compute 42 minus 33. 42 minus 30 is 12, and then minus 3 more is 9. So, 42 - 33 is 9. So, Test 3 has to be at least 9 points.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she scores 9 on the third test, then 15 + 18 + 9 is 42. So, 15 + 18 is 33, plus 9 is 42. So, that adds up to exactly 42, which meets the requirement of at least 42. So, 9 is the minimum she needs to score on the third test.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe I can visualize it or use another method to confirm.

Alternatively, I can think of it as how much more she needs beyond the first two tests. She has 33 points from the first two tests, and she needs a total of 42. So, 42 minus 33 is 9. So, she needs 9 more points on the third test. That makes sense.

Is there a possibility that she could score more than 9 and still pass? Yes, because the requirement is at least 42. So, if she scores 10 on the third test, that would make her total 43, which is still above 42. So, 10 is also acceptable. But, that seems right. So, the minimum is 9.

Wait, that seems right. So, 9 is the minimum. So, the answer is 9.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 15 plus 18 is 33, plus 9 is 42. So, that's correct. 15 + 18 is 33, plus 9 is 42. So, that's exactly the minimum. So, she needs to score at least 9 on the third test.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 9.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is \boxed{9}.

Jane needs to score a total of at least 42 points across three tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. 

First, we add the scores of the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we set up the inequality to find the minimum score needed on the third test:
\[ 33 + \text{Test 3} \geq 42 \]

Solving for Test 3:
\[ \text{Test 3} \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Test 3} \geq 9 \]

Thus, the minimum number of
