Q: Bennet is a farmer. He sells 20 of his eggplants for $3 each. He has 25 ears of corn that he can sell as well. If Bennet wants to make a total of $135, how much should he sell each ear of corn for?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants. Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, which amounts to $6.

Next, determine the remaining amount needed to reach $135. Subtract the $6 earned from eggplants from the total target: $135 - $6 = $129.

Now, find out how much each ear of corn should be sold for. Bennet has 25 ears of corn, so divide the remaining amount by the number of ears: $129 ÷ 25 = $5.16.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $5.160 to reach his total goal of $135.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling eggplants:**
   
   Bennet sells **20 eggplants** at **\$3 each**.
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times \$3 = \$60
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach \$135:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75
   \]

3. **Find out how much each ear of corn should be sold for:**
   
   Bennet has **25 ears of corn** to sell.
   
   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3 \text{ per ear}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$3}
\]
