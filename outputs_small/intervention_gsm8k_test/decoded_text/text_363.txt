Q: John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John driving to his friend's house and then back home. Let me try to figure out how long the entire trip took. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the trip to his friend's house. It's 200 miles away, right? But, that seems right. John drives at a speed of 70 mph. Wait, that seems right. 70 mph is a pretty fast speed, but, that seems right. So, to find out how long it took him to get there, I think I need to use the formula: time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = distance/speed.

So, for the trip to his friend's house, the distance is 200 miles, and his speed is 70 mph. Let me write that down:

Time going to friend = 200 miles / 70 mph.

Hmm, let me calculate that. 200 divided by 70. Let me see, 70 goes into 200 how many times? 70 times 3 is 211, which is less than 220, so 3 times. Then, 200 minus 211 is 9. So, 200/70 is 2 and 60/70, which is approximately 2.828 hours. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 70 times 2 is 140, plus 70 is 210, plus 70 is 280, plus 70 is 350. Wait, that seems right.
