Q: Joey plays football every week. Last week he played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. How many matches did Joey play in one week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of matches Joey played on each day of the week.

On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.

On Friday, he played 1 match.

On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 2 multiplied by 2, resulting in 4 matches.

Next, I'll add up the matches played on all the days: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) +4 (Saturday) equals 7 matches in total for the week.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Matches on Monday:**
   - Joey played **2 matches** on Monday.

2. **Matches on Friday:**
   - Joey played **1 match** on Friday.

3. **Matches on Saturday:**
   - Joey played **double** the number of matches he played on Monday.
   - **Double of 2 matches** is **4 matches**.

4. **Total Matches in the Week:**
   - Add up the matches played on all days:
     \[
     2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \text{ matches}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
