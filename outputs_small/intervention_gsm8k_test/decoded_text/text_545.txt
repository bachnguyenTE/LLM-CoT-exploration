Q: Jeff’s work is 3 miles away.  He walks there and back each day he works.  How many miles does he walk if he has to work 5 times a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Jeff walks to work and back each day he works, and he has to work 5 times a week. The question is asking how many miles he walks in total during the week. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jeff's work is 3 miles away. So, each day, he walks 3 miles to get to work and then another 3 miles to come back home. That means each day, he walks a total of 3 miles there plus 3 miles back. So, that's 3 + 3, which is 6 miles per day. Is that right? Yeah, because 3 miles each way, so 3 times 2 is 6. So, he walks 6 miles each day.

Now, he works 5 times a week. So, each day he walks 6 miles, and he does this 5 times. So, to find the total miles he walks in a week, I need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days he works. That would be 6 miles/day multiplied by 5 days. Let me write that down: 6 * 5.

Calculating that, 6 times 5 is 30. So, does that mean he walks 30 miles in a week? Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, distance to work: 3 miles. So, each day, he walks 3 miles there and 3 miles back. So, 3 + 3 is 6 miles per day. That makes sense because 3 miles each way, so 6 miles total per day. Then, he works 5 days a week, so 6 miles/day * 5 days. 6 times 5 is 30. So, 30 miles in a week. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think of another way to approach it. Maybe using multiplication. 3 miles each way, so 3 * 2 = 6 miles per day. Then, 6 miles per day times 5 days is 30 miles. Yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 3 miles each way, so for each day, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back. So, 3 + 3 = 6. Then, over 5 days, it's 6 * 5 = 30. So, 30 miles in a week. Yeah, that's the same answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 miles each way, 5 days, so 6 miles per day, 5 days, 30 miles. So, 30 miles in a week.

Is there any chance I could have misread the problem? Let me check again. Jeff's work is 3 miles away. He walks there and back each day he works. So, 3 miles each way, so 6 miles per day. 5 times a week. So, 6 * 5 = 30. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 3 miles to work, so 3 miles, and 3 miles back, so 3 miles. So, 3 + 3 = 6. So, 6 miles per day. 5 days, so 6 * 5 = 30. Yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 30 miles in a week. So, the answer is 30 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that 30 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total miles Jeff walks in a week is \boxed{30}.

Jeff's work is 3 miles away, so he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day. This means he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day. 

Since he works 5 times a week, we need to calculate the total miles he walks in 5 days. 

The total miles Jeff walks in a week is calculated as follows:
\[
6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is \boxed{30}.
