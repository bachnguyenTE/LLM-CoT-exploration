Q: It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.  How many hours will it take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes for a large hole for trees. I need to figure out how many hours it will take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that time is involved, and the question is asking for the total time in hours. So, I probably need to calculate the total time in minutes and then convert that to hours. That makes sense because minutes are a smaller unit, and hours are a larger unit, so converting at the end is a good idea.

Alright, so let's break it down. Matthew is digging two types of holes: small ones for shrubs and large ones for trees. Each small hole takes 3 minutes, and each large hole takes 10 minutes. He needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. So, I need to find the total time for all the small holes and all the large holes separately and then add them together.

Let me write that down. For the small holes: 30 holes each taking 3 minutes. So, the total time for small holes would be 30 multiplied by 3. Similarly, for the large holes: 15 holes each taking 10 minutes, so that would be 15 multiplied by 10. Then, I add those two totals together to get the overall time in minutes. After that, I can convert the total minutes into hours.

Let me compute the small holes first. 30 holes times 3 minutes per hole. Hmm, 30 times 3. Let me do that multiplication. 30 times 3 is 90. So, 90 minutes for the small holes.

Now, the large holes: 15 holes times 10 minutes per hole. Wait, that seems right. 15 times 10. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150. So, 150 minutes for the large holes.

Now, adding both together: 90 minutes for small holes plus 150 minutes for large holes. Let me add those. 90 plus 150. Hmm, 90 plus 150 is 140, and then plus 10 more is 150. Wait, that seems right. So, 150 + 90 is 240. Wait, that seems right. 90 plus 150 is 240. So, total time is 240 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 30 times 3 is 90, and 15 times 10 is 150. 90 plus 150 is 240. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the question asks for the time in hours. So, I need to convert 240 minutes into hours. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so I can divide the total minutes by 60 to get hours.

So, 240 divided by 60. Let me compute that. 240 divided by 60 is 4, right? Because 60 times 4 is 240. So, 240 minutes is 4 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 240 minutes is 4 hours. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, putting it all together: Matthew takes 30 small holes, each taking 3 minutes, so 30 times 3 is 90 minutes. 15 large holes, each taking 10 minutes, so 15 times 10 is 150 minutes. Adding those together, 90 plus 150 is 240 minutes. Then, 240 minutes divided by 60 is 4 hours. So, the total time is 4 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 30 times 3 is 90, that's correct. 15 times 10 is 150, that's correct. 90 plus 150 is 240, correct. 240 divided by 60 is 4, correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 30 holes at 3 minutes each: 30 * 3 = 90 minutes. 15 holes at 10 minutes each: 15 * 10 = 150 minutes. 90 + 150 is 240
