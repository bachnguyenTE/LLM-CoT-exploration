Q: Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many pizza pieces has he eaten so far?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Tobias and his pizza. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. Wait, that seems right. 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, then 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. The question is asking how many pieces he has eaten so far. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total number of pieces he ate over the three days.

Alright, let's break it down day by day.

**First Day:**
He ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. So, I need to calculate 2/5 of 60. Let me write that down.

2/5 of 66 is equal to (2/5) * 66. Hmm, let me compute that. 2 times 66 is 132, and then divided by 5. So, 132 divided by 5. Let me do that division. 5 goes into 132 how many times? 5*26 is 130, so that's 26 with a remainder of 2. So, 26 and 2/5. So, 26.4 pieces? Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, he ate 26.4 pieces on the first day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2/5 of 66 is (2*66)/5 = 12/5 = 2.4? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
