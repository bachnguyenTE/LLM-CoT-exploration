Q: Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Tom's restaurant. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Hmm, so that means every night, they have 6 people coming in to eat. Then, they normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. I need to find out how much they make a week if they're open 2 days a week.

Alright, let me break this down. So, each night, they have 6 reservations. Each reservation includes 2 meals and 1 wine. Each meal is $5, and the wine is also $5. So, I need to calculate the total revenue per night and then multiply that by the number of days they're open, which is 2 days a week.

Let me write this out. 

First, calculate the cost per reservation. Each reservation has 2 meals and 1 wine. So, 2 meals at $5 each would be 2 * $5. Let me compute that: 2 * 5 = $10. Wait, that seems right. 2 meals at $5 each is $10. Then, the wine is $5. So, adding that to the meals, the total per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15. Hmm, that seems a bit low, but, that seems right. So, each reservation costs $15.

Wait, that seems right. 2 meals at $5 each is $10, plus a $5 wine is $15. So, each reservation is $15. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.

Now, they get 6 reservations a night. So, per night, the total cost would be 6 * $15. Let me compute that: 6 * 15 = $30. So, each night, they make $30.

But, that seems right. 6 reservations, each costing $15, so 6 * 15 is 90, which is $30. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, they're open 2 days a week. So, to find the weekly revenue, I need to multiply the daily revenue by 2. So, $30 per night * 2 days = $60 per week.

Wait, that seems right. So, Tom's restaurant makes $60 a week.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, per reservation: 2 meals at $5 each is 2*5=10, plus a $5 wine is 10+5=15. So, each reservation is $15. Then, 6 reservations a night: 6*15=90. Wait, that seems right. 6*15 is 90, which is $90 per night. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
