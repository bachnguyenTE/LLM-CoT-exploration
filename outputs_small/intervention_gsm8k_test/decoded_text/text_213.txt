Q: While at the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers by the third day was 500, how many customers did she count on the third day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Sloane counting customers at a dollar store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers. That's straightforward. Then, on the next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day. Hmm, so that would be 100 plus 50, right? Let me write that down to keep track.

First day: 100 customers.

Second day: 100 + 50 = 155 customers.

Okay, so by the end of the second day, how many customers have there been in total? Well, that would be the sum of the first and second day. So, 100 + 155. Let me add those together. 100 plus 100 is 200, and then plus 55 is 275. So, by the end of the second day, there have been 275 customers.

Now, the problem says that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. So, that means by the end of the third day, the total is 500. I need to find out how many customers were counted on the third day. 

Let me think. If by the end of the second day, there were 275 customers, and by the end of the third day, it's 500, then the number of customers on the third day must be the difference between these two totals. So, I can subtract the total by the end of the second day from the total by the end of the third day.

So, that would be 500 minus 275. Let me do that subtraction. 500 minus 200 is 300, and then minus 75 is 225. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 275 plus 225 is 500. Yeah, that adds up. So, the number of customers on the third day is 225.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First day: 100 customers.

Second day: 100 + 55 = 155 customers.

Total after two days: 100 + 155 = 255.

Third day: Total by end of day three is 500.

So, customers on third day: 500 - 255 = 225.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 225.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to interpret the problem. It says, "the total number of customers by the third day was 500." So, does that mean the total is 500, or is it 500 customers on the third day? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, that seems right. If it's the total by the third day, then it's 500. So, the third day's count is 500 minus the total after two days, which is 255. So, 500 - 255 is 225. So, yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it had said that on the third day, there were 50 more customers than the second day, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the problem is straightforward.

So, to recap:

First day: 100.

Second day: 100 + 55 = 155.

Total after two days: 100 + 155 = 255.

Third day: 500 - 255 = 225.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 225.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \boxed{225}.

First day: 100 customers.

Second day: 100 + 55 = 155 customers.

Total after two days: 100 + 155 = 255 customers.

Third day: Total by the end of the third day is 500. Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - 255 = 225.

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \boxed{225}.
