Q: Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Henry's bike trip. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says he made two stops during his 60-mile trip. Wait, that seems right. So, he started his trip, and after 20 miles, he stopped. Then, his second stop was 15 miles before the end. I need to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the total trip is 60 miles. He went 20 miles before stopping. So, his first stop is at 20 miles. Then, his second stop is 15 miles before the end. Since the total trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end would be at 60 - 15 = 51 miles. So, his second stop is at 51 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between the first and second stops, I need to subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop. That would be 51 miles minus 20 miles. Let me do that subtraction: 51 - 20. Hmm, 51 minus 20 is 29. So, he traveled 29 miles between his first and second stops.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. He started at 0, went 20 miles, then another 29 miles, which brings him to 20 + 29 = 51 miles. Then, he stops again at 51 miles, and then continues the trip until the end, which is 60 miles. So, from 51 to 60 is 19 miles. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the distance between the two stops is 29 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 miles to the first stop, then 29 miles to the second stop, totaling 51 miles, and then 19 miles to the end. So, 20 + 29 + 19 = 68 miles? Wait, that seems right.
