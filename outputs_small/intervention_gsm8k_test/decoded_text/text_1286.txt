Q: James likes to check the coin return of the vending machine for change. One day he finds a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. How much money in cents does James have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of money James has in cents.

He found a quarter, which is worth 25 cents.

He also found two nickels, each worth 5 cents, so that's 2 times 5 cents, totaling 10 cents.

Additionally, he found seven dimes, each worth 10 cents, so that's 7 times 10 cents, totaling 70 cents.

Finally, I add up all the amounts: 25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) equals 105 cents.

**Solution:**

James found the following coins:

- **1 quarter:** 25 cents
- **2 nickels:** 2 × 5 = 10 cents
- **7 dimes:** 7 × 10 = 70 cents

**Total amount of money:**

\[
25 \text{ cents} + 10 \text{ cents} +70 \text{ cents} = 105 \text{ cents}
\]

\[
\boxed{105}
\]
