Okay, so I have this problem here about a council meeting where they voted on a new regulation. The question says that the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. And there are 33 people on the council. I need to find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the council has 33 people. So, the total number of votes is 33. Now, the vote passed had twice as many votes in favor as against it. So, if I let the number of votes against be some number, then the number in favor would be twice that.

Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let me call the number of votes against the new regulation as 'x'. Then, the number of votes in favor would be '2x' because it's twice as many as against.

So, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against. That would be x (against) + 2x (in favor) = 3x. But, that seems right. So, 3x equals the total number of votes, which is 33.

So, 3x = 33. To find x, I can divide both sides by 3. So, x = 33 / 3, which is 11. So, x is 11. That means the number of votes against is 11, and the number in favor is twice that, which is 22.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check. If there are 11 votes against and 22 in favor, then 11 + 22 is 33, which is the total number of council members. So, that adds up correctly.

But, that seems right. So, the number of votes in favor is 22.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the problem says the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as against. So, if I let the against be x, then in favor is 2x. So, total is x + 2x = 3x. 3x = 33, so x=11, so in favor is 22. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the ratio of votes in favor to votes against is 2:1. So, the total parts are 2 +1=3 parts. Each part is 33 /3=11. So, votes in favor is 2 parts, which is 22. So, same answer.

So, that seems consistent. So, the number of votes in favor is 22.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 22.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \boxed{22}.

Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation. Then, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \). The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). Given that the total number of council members is 33, we have:

\[
3x = 33
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{33}{3} = 11
\]

Thus, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \boxed{22}.
