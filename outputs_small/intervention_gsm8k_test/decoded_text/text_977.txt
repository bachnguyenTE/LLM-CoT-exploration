Q: Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside.  Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles.  While on vacation, if she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?

Okay, so I have this problem about Pamela and her sunscreen. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Pamela reaps an ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. Her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles. While on vacation, she will be outside 4 hours a day over 8 days. The question is, how many bottles of sunscreen will she need to pack?

Alright, so let's break this down. First, I need to find out how much sunscreen Pamela uses in total during her vacation. Then, since each bottle is 8 ounces, I can figure out how many bottles she needs by dividing the total ounces by 8. If there's any remainder, she'll need an extra bottle.

Let me start by calculating the total number of hours she's outside. She's outside 4 hours each day for 8 days. So, that's 4 hours/day multiplied by 8 days. Let me write that out:

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Okay, so she's outside for 32 hours. Now, she uses an ounce of sunscreen every hour. So, the total amount of sunscreen she'll use is 1 ounce/hour * 32 hours. Let me calculate that:

Total sunscreen = 1 ounce/hour * 32 hours = 32 ounces.

Alright, so she needs 32 ounces of sunscreen. Now, each bottle is 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, I can divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:

Number of bottles = 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. 8 ounces per bottle times 4 bottles is 32 ounces. So, she needs exactly 4 bottles. Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total hours: 4 * 8 = 32. Correct. Total sunscreen: 1 * 32 = 32. Correct. Number of bottles: 32 / 8 = 4. Correct.

But, that seems right. So, she needs 4 bottles. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 4 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. She uses 1 ounce every hour, 4 hours a day, 8 days. So, 4*8=32 hours. 1 ounce per hour, so 32 ounces. Each bottle is 8 ounces, so 32 divided by 8 is 4. So, 4 bottles. So, the answer is 4.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

But, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 4 bottles.
