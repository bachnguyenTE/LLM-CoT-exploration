Q: Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not too confident about age problems, but, that seems right. 

First, let me parse the problem. It says Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, right now, Jerry's age is equal to twice his age 5 years back. And then, we need to find out how old he'll be in 3 years. Alright, so we need to set up an equation here.

Let me denote Jerry's current age as J. That seems straightforward. So, right now, his age is J. Five years ago, his age would have been J minus 5, right? Because if he's J now, five years ago he was younger by five years. So, that's J - 5.

The problem says he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, that means his current age J is equal to 2 times his age five years ago. So, in equation form, that would be:

J = 2 * (J - 5)

Okay, so that's the equation. Let me write that down:

J = 2(J - 5)

Now, I need to solve for J. Let me expand the right side first. So, 2 times (J - 5) is 2J - 10. So, the equation becomes:

J = 2J - 10

Hmm, now I need to get all the J terms on one side. Let me subtract J from both sides to get:

0 = J - 10

Which simplifies to:

J = 10

Wait, that seems right. So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. Let me check that.

If Jerry is 10 now, then five years ago he was 10 - 5 = 5. Is 10 twice 5? Yes, because 2*5 is 10. So, that checks out.

Now, the question is asking how old Jerry will be in 3 years. So, if he's currently 10, in 3 years he'll be 10 + 3 = 13. So, the answer should be 13.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Let J be Jerry's current age.
2. Five years ago, his age was J - 5.
3. According to the problem, J = 2*(J -5)
4. Solving: J = 2J -10
5. Subtract J: 0 = J -10
6. So, J =10
7. In 3 years, he'll be 10 +3 =13

Yes, that all makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer is 13.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of age differences. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means the difference in his age is 5 years. So, the difference between his current age and his age 5 years ago is 5. But, that seems right. So, if his current age is J, and 5 years ago it was J -5, then the difference is 5. So, the current age is twice that, which is 2*(J -5). So, same equation as before.

So, J = 2*(J -5). So, same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of how much older he is now compared to 5 years ago. So, if he was 5 years younger 5 years ago, and now he's twice as old as that. So, that's the same as saying his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, which is the same as the equation.

So, yeah, I think that's solid. So, the answer is 13.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think about it in another way. If in 3 years he'll be 13, then 5 years ago he was 10, which is 5 years younger. So, 13 is twice 10, which is 5 years ago. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about the age difference. The age difference between now and 5 years ago is 5 years. So, if he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means the age difference is 5
