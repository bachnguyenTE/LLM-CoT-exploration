Q: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?

Okay, so I have this problem here about three truck drivers: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary. Each has a truck that can carry a certain amount of gravel. The problem gives me some information, and I need to figure out how much Gary's truck can carry. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what I know:

1. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Wait, that seems right. So, Gissela's truck capacity is 4,000 pounds. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? It should probably be 4,000 pounds? Yeah, that makes more sense. So, Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds. I'll write that as 4000 pounds.

2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's. So, Gordy's capacity is Gissela's plus 800. Since Gissela can carry 4,000, Gordy can carry 4,000 + 800. Let me calculate that. 4,000 + 800 is... 4,800 pounds. So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds.

3. When Gary joins Gissela, Gordy, and brings his truck, the combined capacity is 11,600 pounds. So, all three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds. I need to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

Let me denote the capacity of Gary's truck as G. So, G is what I need to find.

So, Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds.

Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds.

Gary's truck: G pounds.

Combined, they can carry 11,600 pounds. So, the sum of all three trucks is 11,600.

So, 4,000 (Gissela) + 4,800 (Gordy) + G (Gary) = 11,600.

So, let me write that equation:

4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600.

Now, let me compute 4,000 + 4,800. 4,000 + 4,800 is 8,800. So, 8,800 + G = 11,600.

So, to find G, I subtract 8,800 from both sides:

G = 11,600 - 8,800.

Let me compute that. 11,600 minus 8,800. Hmm, 11,600 minus 8,000 is 3,600, and then minus 800 more is 2,800. So, G is 2,800 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Gissela: 4,000

Gordy: 4,800

Total of Gissela and Gordy: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800

Total combined with Gary: 11,600

So, 8,800 + G = 11,600

Therefore, G = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Yes, that seems correct. So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the arithmetic.

4,000 + 4,800: 4,000 + 4,000 is 8,000, plus 800 is 8,800. Correct.

11,600 - 8,800: 11,600 minus 8,800. Let's see, 11,600 minus 8,800.

11,600 - 8,800: 11,600 - 8,800 is 2,800. So, yes, 2,800.

So, I think that's correct.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 2,800 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again.

Gissela: 4,0
