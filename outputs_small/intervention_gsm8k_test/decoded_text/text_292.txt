Q: Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine Susan's earnings per 10 minutes, which is $5.

Next, calculate the total time she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., which is 3 hours or 1800 minutes.

Since she pauses for half an hour (30 minutes) each time, the total working time is 180 minutes minus 30 minutes, resulting in 1510 minutes.

Finally, divide the total working time by the time interval to find out how many intervals she worked: 1510 divided by 10 is 151 intervals.

Multiply the number of intervals by her earnings per interval to find her total earnings: 151 times $5 equals $255.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Susan's earnings per 10 minutes:**
   
   Susan earns **\$5** every 10 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total time Susan works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.:**
   
   - **Total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.:** 3 hours = 180 minutes
   - **Time taken for each pause:** 30 minutes = 30 minutes

3. **Calculate the total working time:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total working time} = 180\ \text{minutes} - 30\ \text{minutes} = 150\ \text{minutes}
   \]

4. **Determine how many 10-minute intervals Susan worked:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{150\ \text{ minutes}}{10\ \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15\ \text{ intervals}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15\ \text{intervals} \times \$5\ \text{per interval} = \$75
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\$75}
