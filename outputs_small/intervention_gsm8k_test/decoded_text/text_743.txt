Q: Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mara adding cake slices and then tripling them, eating some, and her friend stealing some. I need to figure out how many slices are left. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices. So, let me write that down. Initially, there are 2 slices. Then she adds 3 more. Hmm, so 2 plus 3. That should be 5 slices. Let me check that: 2 + 3 = 5. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, it says she was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. Hmm, okay, so she had 5 slices, and she tripled that. Tripling means multiplying by 3, right? So, 5 times 3. Let me calculate that: 5 * 3 = 15. Wait, that seems right. So after tripling, she has 15 slices on her plate.

Then, she ate 2 slices. So, from 15 slices, she ate 2. Let me subtract that: 15 - 2 = 13. So now, she has 13 slices left.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 15 minus 2 is 13. Okay, so after she ate 2 slices, there are 13 left.

However, while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. Hmm, so from the 13 slices, her friend took away 5. So, 13 minus 5. Let me do that: 13 - 5 = 8. So, after her friend stole 5 slices, there are 8 slices left.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me recap all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Start with 2 slices.
2. Add 3 slices: 2 + 3 = 5.
3. Triple the number: 5 * 3 = 15.
4. Subtract 2 slices: 15 - 2 = 13.
5. Subtract 5 slices: 13 - 5 = -2.
