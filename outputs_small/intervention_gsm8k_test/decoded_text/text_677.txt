Q: Carol and Jennifer are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from celebrities. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?

Okay, so Carol and Jennifer are sisters who collect signatures from celebrities. They've already been collecting for five weeks, and now they have 20 and 44 signatures respectively. They have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they want to reach a total of 100 signatures between them by the end. The question is asking how many more signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44. So together, they've collected 20 + 44 = 66 signatures so far. They have three more weeks to reach a total of 100 signatures. So, the total number of signatures they need to collect is 100, and they've already collected 66. Therefore, the number of signatures they still need to collect is 100 - 66 = 34.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 20 + 44 is indeed 66. 100 minus 66 is 34. So, they need to collect 34 more signatures in the next three weeks.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering the rate at which they collect signatures each week. The problem doesn't specify how many signatures they collect each week, so I think we can assume that they can collect the same number each week.

So, if they have three more weeks, and they need 34 more signatures, then they need to collect 34 divided by 3 weeks. That would be approximately 11.333 signatures per week. But, that seems right. So, they need to collect 34 signatures over the next three weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, 34 divided by 3 is about 11.333, which is 11 and 1/3. So, they need to collect 11 and 1/3 signatures each week. But, that seems right. So, in three weeks, 11 and 1/3 times 3 is 34. So, that adds up.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 34. So, they need to collect 34 more signatures.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of signatures they need to collect is 100, and they have already collected 66, so they need 34 more. So, the answer is 34.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.
