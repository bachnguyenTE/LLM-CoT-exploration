Q: 4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?

Okay, so I have this problem here: 4 adults and 8 children are sharing 8 packets of chocolate bars. Each packet has 5 chocolate bars. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and the rest are to be shared equally among the children. I need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. There are 4 adults and 8 children, so that's a total of 12 people. They have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 times 5. Let me calculate that: 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars. So, there are 40 chocolate bars in total.

Now, each adult is supposed to get 6 chocolate bars. There are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6. Let me compute that: 4 *6 = 24. So, 24 chocolate bars are given to the adults.

That means the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children. The total number of chocolate bars is 40, and 24 are given to adults, so the remaining is 40 -24. Let me subtract: 40 -24 = 16. So, there are 16 chocolate bars left for the children.

There are 8 children, so each child will get 16 divided by 8. Let me compute that: 16 /8 = 2. So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total chocolate bars: 8 packets *5 =40. Adults:4*6=24. Remaining:40-24=16. Divided by 8 children:16/8=2. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Each child gets 2, so 8 children *2=16, which matches the remaining chocolate bars. So, that seems consistent.

I don't think I made any errors here. So, the answer should be 2 chocolate bars per child.

**Final Answer**
Each child will get \boxed{2} chocolate bars.

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars are given to the adults. There are 4 adults, each receiving 6 chocolate bars:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find the remaining:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

These remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children:
\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]

Thus, each child will get \boxed{2} chocolate bars.
