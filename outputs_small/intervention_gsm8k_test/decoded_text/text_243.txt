Q: Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jason's phone plan. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Jason has a phone plan that allows him to use 1000 minutes per month. That seems like a lot, but, that seems right. I guess it's a plan for when he doesn't have any extra minutes. So, every day, he uses 15 minutes calling his boss. Hmm, okay, so each day, he's spending 15 minutes on that. 

Now, the problem says he's had 300 extra minutes of calls this month to other people. So, that's not related to his boss. So, that's 300 minutes of calls outside of his boss. 

The question is asking how many minutes Jason has left if this month has 30 days. So, we need to calculate how much he used in total and subtract that from his plan.

Let me break it down. First, let's figure out how many minutes he used calling his boss. He has 30 days in the month, and each day he has a 15-minute call. So, that would be 30 days multiplied by 15 minutes per day. 

Let me write that down: 30 * 15. Hmm, 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 5 is 150, so adding those together, 300 * 15 is 450 minutes. So, he used 450 minutes calling his boss.

Next, he has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, that's 300 minutes. 

So, total minutes used this month would be the minutes calling his boss plus the extra minutes. So, 450 + 300. Let me add those: 450 + 300 is 750, and then plus 0 is still 750. So, he used 750 minutes in total this month.

His phone plan is 1000 minutes. So, to find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan. So, 1000 - 750. 

Wait, that seems right. 1000 minus 750 is 250. So, he has 250 minutes left.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, 30 days times 15 minutes is 450. That seems correct. 30*15: 30*10 is 300, 30*5 is 150, so 300+150=450. 

Then, 450 plus 300 is 750. That seems right. 450+300 is 750. 

Then, 1000 minus 750 is 250. That makes sense. 

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his plan.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. He uses 450 minutes on his boss and 300 extra, totaling 750, so 1000 minus 750 is 250. 

Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Jason has \boxed{250} minutes left.

Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Each day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he has 300 extra minutes of calls this month to other people. The month has 30 days.

First, calculate the total minutes Jason used calling his boss:
\[
30 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ minutes/day} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the extra minutes he used calling other people:
\[
450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

Subtract the total minutes used from the phone plan:
\[
1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Jason has \boxed{250} minutes left.
