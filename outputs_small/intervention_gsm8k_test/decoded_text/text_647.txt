Q: Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?

Okay, so Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard, and he needs to figure out how long it will take him to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. But, that seems right. So, he's faster through soil than through clay. It also mentions that he can dig half as fast through clay. So, if he can dig 4 feet/hour through soil, then through clay, he can only dig half that speed. Let me calculate that.

If he digs 4 feet/hour through soil, then through clay, he would dig at 4 divided by 2, which is 2 feet per hour. Okay, so his digging rate through clay is 2 feet/hour. Got that.

Now, the well has two sections: 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. I need to find out how long it takes him to dig each section and then add those times together to get the total time.

Starting with the soil. He needs to dig 24 feet of soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour. To find the time, I can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

So, for the soil, that would be 24 feet divided by 4 feet per hour. Let me do that calculation. 24 divided by 4 is 6. So, it takes him 6 hours to dig through the soil.

Now, moving on to the clay section. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay at a rate of 2 feet per hour. Again, using the same formula, Time = Distance / Rate. So, 8 divided by 2 is 4. That means it takes him 4 hours to dig through the clay.

To find the total time, I just need to add the time for the soil and the time for the clay together. So, 6 hours plus 4 hours equals 10 hours. Therefore, it should take Bill 10 hours in total to dig the well.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the soil: 24 feet divided by 4 feet per hour is indeed 6 hours. For the clay: 8 feet divided by 2 feet per hour is 4 hours. Adding them together gives 10 hours. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the total time is 10 hours.

**Final Answer**
It will take Bill \boxed{10} hours to dig the well.

Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil and half that speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. 

To find the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Distance: 24 feet
- Rate: 4 feet per hour
- Time: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \)

To find the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Distance: 8 feet
- Rate: 2 feet per hour
- Time: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

Adding the times together:
- Total time: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \)

\[
\boxed{10}
