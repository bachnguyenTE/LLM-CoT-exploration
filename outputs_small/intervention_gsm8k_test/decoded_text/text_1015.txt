Q: Anne purchased a box of sweets that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept two packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. How many pieces of sweets did each of her friends receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Anne bought a box of sweets. Let me try to figure out how many pieces each of her friends received. Hmm, the problem says there are 15 packs in the box, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, first, I think I need to find out the total number of sweets in the box. 

Alright, so if there are 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, I can multiply 15 by 60 to get the total number of sweets. Let me write that down: 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack. Hmm, 15 times 60. I can break that down to make it easier. 10 times 60 is 600, and 5 times 60 is 300. So, adding those together, 660. So, the total number of sweets is 660 pieces. Wait, that seems right. 15 packs, each with 60, so 15*60=300? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 15*60 is 300? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
