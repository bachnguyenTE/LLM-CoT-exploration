Q: Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. There were 9 pens in each bag of blue and 6 pens in each bag of red. How many pens does Janet have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of green pens Janet originally had, which is 22.

Next, I'll calculate the number of yellow pens by adding 10 to the green pens: 22 + 10 = 32 yellow pens.

Then, I'll find out how many blue pens Janet bought by multiplying the number of bags by pens per bag: 6 bags × 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.

Similarly, I'll calculate the number of red pens by multiplying the number of red bags by pens per bag: 2 bags × 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.

Finally, I'll add up all the pens: green + yellow + blue + red = 22 + 32 + 54 + 12 = 120 pens in total.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Green Pens:**
   - Janet initially had **22 green pens**.

2. **Yellow Pens:**
   - She had **10 yellow pens**.
   - **Total pens so far:** \(22 + 10 = 32\) pens.

3. **Blue Pens:**
   - She bought **6 bags** of blue pens.
   - Each bag contains **9 pens**.
   - **Total blue pens:** \(6 \times 9 = 54\) pens.

4. **Red Pens:**
   - She bought **2 bags** of red pens.
   - Each bag contains **6 pens**.
   - **Total red pens:** \(2 \times 6 = 12\) pens.

5. **Total Pens:**
   - **Green pens + Yellow pens + Blue pens + Red pens**
   - \(22 + 32 + 54 + 12 = 120\) pens.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{120}
