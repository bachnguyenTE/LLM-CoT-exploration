Q: Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. How big is Peter's locker in cubic inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Timothy, Zack, and Peter's lockers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. That seems straightforward. So, Timothy's locker volume is 24 in³. 

Next, it says Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. Hmm, okay. So, if Timothy's locker is 24, then half of that would be Zack's locker. Let me write that down. 

Zack's locker volume = (1/2) * Timothy's locker volume
So, Zack's locker = (1/2) * 24 in³

Let me calculate that. Half of 24 is 12, right? So, Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches. That makes sense because it's half the size of Timothy's.

Now, moving on to Peter's locker. It says Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's. Okay, so Peter's locker is a quarter of Zack's volume. Let me write that down too.

Peter's locker volume = (1/4) * Zack's locker volume
So, Peter's locker = (1/4) * 12 in³

Hmm, let me compute that. A quarter of 12 is... well, 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with Timothy's locker: 24 in³. Half of that is 12 in³, which is Zack's. Then, a quarter of 12 is 3 in³. Yeah, that seems correct. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. Each locker is a fraction of the previous one, so I just multiplied by the respective fractions step by step. 

So, to recap: 

- Timothy: 24 in³
- Zack: 24 * (1/2) = 12 in³
- Peter: 12 * (1/4) = 3 in³

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

I think that's all there is to it. I don't see any other steps or complexities here. It's just a matter of applying the fractions step by step. 

Just to make sure, let me visualize it. If Timothy's locker is 24, Zack is half that, so 12, and Peter is a quarter of Zack's, so 3. Yeah, that makes sense. 

I don't think I need to convert any units or anything because they're all in cubic inches, so no need to worry about that. 

So, yeah, I think I've got it right. Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

**Final Answer**
The volume of Peter's locker is \boxed{3} cubic inches.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we calculate Zack's locker volume as follows:

\[
\text{Zack's locker volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \, \text{in}^3 = 12 \,000 \,000 \,000 \, \text{in}^3
\]

Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker, so we calculate Peter's locker volume as follows:

\[
\text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \, \text{in}^3 = 3 \,000,000 \, \text{in}^3
\]

Thus, the volume of Peter's locker is \(\boxed{3}\) cubic inches.
