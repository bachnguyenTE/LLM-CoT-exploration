Q: Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. How many slices of apple did they all eat?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many slices each person ate.

Q: Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister.

A: Let's break this down step by step.

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, to find the total number of slices eaten by all three, I'll add them up: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of apple slices eaten by all three is 6.

Let's determine how many slices of apple each person ate and then find the total.

1. **Doxa** ate **1 slice**.
2. **Her sister** ate **1 more slice than Doxa**, so:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Doxa)} + 1 = 2 \text{ slices}
   \]
3. **Her brother** ate **1 more slice than her sister**, so:
   \[
   2 \text{ (sister)} + 1 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
\[
1 \text{ (Doxa)} + 2 \text{ (sister)} + 3 \text{ (brother)} = 6 \text{ slices}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
