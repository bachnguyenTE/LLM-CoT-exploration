Q: The cell-phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Now, the phone is at 60% charged. How long will it take to fully charge, in hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a cell-phone recharging. Let me try to understand it step by step. The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Right now, it's at 60% charged, and I need to figure out how long it will take to fully charge. Hmm, okay.

First, let me make sure I understand the rate. It says 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. So, every 3 minutes, the phone gains 1% of its charge. That makes sense. So, if it's at 60%, it needs to go up to 100% to be fully charged, right? Wait, that seems right. So, the phone needs to gain 100% of its charge to go from 60% to 100%. Hmm, no, wait, that seems right. 100% of 1% is 1%, so 100% of 60% is 6%. So, 6% more is needed. Wait, that seems right. So, 6% of the charge is needed.

But, that seems right. So, if it's at 60%, it needs to go up to 100%, so the difference is 100% - 60% = 40%. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 40% of the charge is needed.

Wait, that seems right. So, 40% is needed. So, if it's charging at 1% per 3 minutes, how long will it take to charge 40%?

So, let me think. If 1% takes 3 minutes, then 40% would take 40 times 3 minutes, right? So, 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. Then, 120 minutes is 2 hours. So, the answer is 2 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, the phone is at 60%, needs to go to 100%, so 40% more. It charges 1% every 3 minutes, so 40% would take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes, which is 2 hours. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 1% per 3 minutes. So, 1% is 3 minutes. So, 1% per 3 minutes is a rate of 1/3 per minute. So, the rate is 1/3 percentage per minute. So, to find the time needed to charge 40%, it's 40% divided by (1/3)% per minute, which is 40 * 3 = 120 minutes, which is 2 hours. Yeah, that's the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of equations. Let me set up an equation. Let t be the time in minutes. The rate is 1% per 3 minutes, so the rate is (1/3)% per minute. So, the total charge after t minutes is 60% + (1/3)% * t. We need this to be equal to 100%. So, 60 + (1/3)t = 100. So, subtract 60 from both sides: (1/3)t = 40. Multiply both sides by 3: t = 120 minutes, which is 2 hours. Yeah, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions. 1% per 3 minutes is equivalent to 1/3% per minute. So, to get 40%, it's 40 divided by (1/3) which is 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. So, same answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, 120 minutes is 2 hours. So, the answer is 2 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using proportions. So, if 1% takes 3 minutes, then 40% would take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about how much charge is needed and the rate. So, 40% needed, 1% every 3 minutes. So, 40 / 1 = 40, so 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. So, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total time as (40%) / (1% / 3 minutes) = 40 * 3 = 12
