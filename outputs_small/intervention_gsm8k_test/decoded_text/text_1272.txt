Q: Helen went on a trip through Germany. She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?

Okay, so Helen went on a trip through Germany and spent money on a hotel and bus. I need to figure out how much she paid in total for both the hotel and the bus. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says she booked a hotel for 3 nights. Each night at the hotel costs $80. So, to find the total cost for the hotel, I should multiply the number of nights by the cost per night. That would be 3 nights multiplied by $80 per night. Let me write that out:

Hotel cost = 3 nights × $80/night

Hmm, 3 times 80. Let me calculate that. 3 times 80 is 240. So, the hotel cost is $240. That seems straightforward.

Next, she rode the bus 7 times during the trip. Each bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, first, I need to find out how much one bus trip costs. Since one night at the hotel is $80, 10% of that would be 0.10 multiplied by 80.

Let me compute that: 0.10 × 80. Hmm, 0.1 times 80 is 8.8. So, each bus trip costs $8.80.

Now, she took the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus would be 7 trips multiplied by the cost per trip. That would be 7 × $8.80. Let me calculate that.

7 times 8.80. Let me break that down. 7 times 8 is 56, and 7 times 0.80 is 5.89. So, adding those together, 56 + 5.89 is 61.89. Wait, that seems right. So, the total bus cost is $61.89.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 8.80 times 7: 8 times 7 is 56, 0.80 times 7 is 5.60, so 56 + 5.60 is 61.60. Oh, I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. It should be $61.60, not $61.89. So, I need to correct that.

So, total bus cost is $61.60.

Now, to find the total amount Helen paid for both the hotel and the bus, I need to add the hotel cost and the bus cost together.

Hotel cost: $240 (Wait, that seems right. 3 nights at $80 each is 3×80=240. Yes, that's correct.)

Wait, that seems right. 3×80 is 240. So, $240 for the hotel.

Bus cost: $61.60.

So, total cost is 240 + 61.60.

Let me add those together. 240 + 61 is 301, and then 0.60 is 301.60. So, total is $301.60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify:

240
+61.60
= 301.60

Yes, that's correct.

So, Helen paid a total of $301.60 for her hotel and bus travel during the trip.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Hotel cost: 3 nights × $80 per night = 3×80=240. Correct.

2. Bus cost per trip: 10% of $80 = 0.10×80=8.80. Correct.

3. Total bus cost: 7 trips × $8.80 per trip. Let me compute 7×8.80 again.

8.80 ×7: 8×7=56, 0.80×7=5.60. So, 56 +5.60=61.60. Correct.

4. Total cost: 240 +61.60=301.60. Correct.

So, I think that's all correct. So, the total amount Helen paid is $301.60.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the bus cost as 10% of the hotel cost per trip, and then multiply by the number of trips.
