Q: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the ages of Brandon's iPhone, Ben's iPhone, and Suzy's iPhone. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone." Hmm, okay. So if I let Ben's iPhone age be some number, then Brandon's would be four times that. But, that seems right. Let me write that down.

Let me assign variables to make it clearer. Let me say:

Let B = age of Ben's iPhone.

Then, according to the problem, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. So, that would be:

Br = 4 * B

Got that. So, if Ben's iPhone is B years old, Brandon's is 4B years old.

Next, the problem says: "Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone." Hmm, okay. So, Ben's age is two times Suzy's age. Let me assign another variable for Suzy's iPhone.

Let S = age of Suzy's iPhone.

So, Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. That means:

B = 2 * S

Got that. So, Ben's age is twice Suzy's age.

The problem also says: "If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?"

Oh, okay, so Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. So, S = 1.

So, if S = 1, then Ben's iPhone is two times that, so B = 2 * 1 = 2. So, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Then, since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, that would be 4 * B. Since B is 2, that would be 4 * 2 = 8.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

If Suzy's iPhone is 1, then Ben's is 2, and then Brandon's is 4 times Ben's, which is 8. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it all in one equation.

Given that S = 1, then B = 2S = 2*1 = 2.

Then, Br = 4B = 4*2 = 8.

So, yes, 8 years old.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the logic. It's straightforward substitution.

Just to make sure, let's think about the relationships again.

- Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

- Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's. So, 2*1=2.

- Brandon's iPhone is four times Ben's. So, 4*2=8.

Yep, that all adds up. So, I think the answer is 8.

**Final Answer**
The age of Brandon’s iPhone is \boxed{8}.
</think>

Given that Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, we need to determine the age of Brandon’s iPhone.

1. Let \( S \) be the age of Suzy’s iPhone. We know \( S = 1 \).
2. Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Therefore, Ben’s iPhone age \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = 2 \times S = 2 \times 1 = 2
   \]
3. Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone age \( Br \) is:
   \[
   Br = 4 \times B = 4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon’s iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\).
