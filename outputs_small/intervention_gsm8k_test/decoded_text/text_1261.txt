Q: Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt and $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, let me understand the problem. Alicia has to send her clothes to the dry cleaners weekly, and each week she drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt. The charges are $5.000 per blouse, $6.000 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants. I need to calculate the total cost for 5 weeks.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the cost for one week first and then multiply it by 5 weeks. That makes sense because the weekly cost is consistent each week.

Let me write down the details:

- Blouses per week: 5
- Pants per week: 2
- Skirts per week: 1

Costs:

- Blouses: $5.000 each
- Pants: $8.00 each
- Skirts: $6.00 each

So, for one week, the cost would be:

Total cost = (Number of blouses * cost per blouse) + (Number of pants * cost per pants) + (Number of skirts * cost per skirt)

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost per week = (5 * $5.00) + (2 * $8.00) + (1 * $6.00)

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute each part separately.

First, 5 blouses at $5.00 each. So, 5 * 5.00. Let me calculate that. 5 times 5 is 25, and 5 times 00 is 0. So, 25 + 0 = $25.00.

Next, 2 pants at $8.00 each. So, 2 * 8.00. 2 times 8 is 16, and 2 times 0 is 0. So, that's $16.00.

Then, 1 skirt at $6.00. That's straightforward, 1 * 6.00 = $6.00.

Now, adding all these up: $25.00 + $16.000 + $6.00.

Let me add them step by step. 25 + 16 is 41, and then 41 + 6 is 47. So, $47.00 per week.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

5 blouses at $5.00: 5*5=25, yes.

2 pants at $8.00: 2*8=16, yes.

1 skirt at $6.00: 1*6=6, yes.

Total per week: 25 + 16 + 6. 25 + 16 is 41, plus 6 is 47. So, $47.00 per week.

Okay, so that's correct. Now, since she does this for 5 weeks, I need to multiply the weekly cost by 5.

Total cost for 5 weeks = 5 * $47.00.

Let me compute that. 5 times 47 is 235. So, $235.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify:

47 * 5: 40*5=200, 7*5=35, so 200+35=235. Yes, that's correct.

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning over 5 weeks.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if I missed anything.

Wait, that seems right. 5 blouses at $5 each is 25, 2 pants at $8 each is 16, 1 skirt at $6 is 6. 25+16=41, 41+6=47. 47 per week, 5 weeks is 235. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 5 weeks, so 5 blouses each week, so 5*5=25 blouses, 2 pants each week, so 2*5=10 pants, 1 skirt each week, so 1*5=5 skirts. Then, total cost is 25*5 + 10*8 + 5*6.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that.

25 blouses at $5: 25.

10 pants at $8: 80.

5 skirts at
