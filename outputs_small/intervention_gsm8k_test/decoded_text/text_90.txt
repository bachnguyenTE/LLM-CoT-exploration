Q: Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the dinosaur picnic. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Ted is planning to bring potato salad for both adults and children. An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. There are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. Ted wants to make sure there's enough for everyone, so I need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required.

Alright, let's start by figuring out how much one child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs, a child should eat 10 lbs divided by 2. Let me write that down:

Child's consumption = 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.

So, each child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad. Now, Ted has 5 children coming to the picnic. To find the total amount of potato salad needed for the children, I can multiply the child's consumption by the number of children.

Total for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

Okay, so the children will need 25 lbs of potato salad. Now, moving on to the adults. There are 22 adults, and each adult eats 10 lbs. So, the total for the adults would be:

Total for adults = 22 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 220 lbs.

Wait, that seems right. 22 times 10 is 220. So, the adults will need 220 lbs of potato salad.

Now, to find the total amount Ted needs to bring, I should add the potato salad required for adults and children together.

Total potato salad needed = Total for adults + Total for children = 220 lbs + 25 lbs.

Let me add those numbers: 220 + 25. Hmm, 220 + 20 is 240, and then +5 is 245. So, 245 lbs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, child's consumption: 10 / 2 = 5 lbs. That's correct.

Number of children: 5. So, 5 * 5 = 25 lbs. That's correct.

Number of adults: 22. Each eats 10 lbs. So, 22 *10 = 220 lbs. That's correct.

Adding them together: 220 +25 = 245. Yeah, that seems right.

So, Ted needs to bring 245 lbs of potato salad.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating the total consumption per person and then multiplying by the number of people? But, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have calculated the total consumption for adults and children separately and then added them.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

Each adult eats 10 lbs, each child eats 5 lbs. So, for 22 adults, it's 22*10=220, and for 5 children, it's 5*5=25. Then, 220+25=245. Yeah, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total consumption as 10 lbs per person, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Because each person, whether adult or child, is eating a certain amount. So, 22 adults and 5 children, each with their own consumption.

Wait, that seems right. So, 22 +5=27 people, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
