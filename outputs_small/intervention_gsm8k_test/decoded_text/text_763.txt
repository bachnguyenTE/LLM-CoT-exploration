Q: Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rob, Royce, and Pedro who are contractors. They need to put on a new roof on three homes. The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me check: 250 cases in total. 

The problem says that the first house needs 1/2 of the second house, and the third house needs double the first. I need to find out how many cases the third house will need. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

Let me assign some variables to make it easier. Let's say the number of cases needed by the first house is x. Then, according to the problem, the second house needs 1/2 of the first house. So, the second house would need (1/2)x cases. 

Now, the third house needs double the first house. So, if the first house is x, the third house would need 2x cases. 

So, now I have expressions for all three houses in terms of x. Let me write that down:

- First house: x
- Second house: (1/2)x
- Third house: 2x

Now, the total number of cases needed is 250. So, if I add up all the cases needed by the three houses, it should equal 250. So, I can write the equation:

x + (1/2)x + 2x = 250

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. The first house is x, the second is half of that, so (1/2)x, and the third is double the first, so 2x. Adding them together gives the total. So, yes, that equation is correct.

Now, let me solve for x. So, let's combine like terms. First, x is the same as 1x, so 1x + 0.5x + 2x. Let me add those up.

1 + 0.5 is 1.5, and 1.5 + 2 is 3.5. So, 3.5x equals 250.

So, 3.5x = 250. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 3.5.

So, x = 250 / 3.5

Hmm, let me compute that. 250 divided by 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 goes into 250 how many times?

Well, 3.5 times 70 is 245, because 3.5 times 70 is 245. So, 250 minus 245 is 5. So, 5 divided by 3.5 is 1.42857... So, approximately 1.42857.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3.5 times 71.42857 is 250. So, x is approximately 71.42857.

But, that seems right. Let me check my math again.

Wait, that seems right. 3.5 times 71.42857 is 250. So, x is approximately 71.42857.

But, that seems right. So, x is approximately 71.42857. So, the first house needs approximately 71.42857 cases.

But, that seems right. Let me see if I can write that as a fraction. 250 divided by 3.5 is the same as 250 divided by 7/2, which is 250 multiplied by 2/7, which is 500/7, which is 78 and 4/7. So, 78 and 4/7.

So, x is 78 and 4/7 cases. So, the first house needs 78 4/7 cases.

Then, the second house needs half of that, so 1/2 of 78 4/7. Let me compute that.

Half of 78 is 39, and half of 4/7 is 2/7. So, the second house needs 39 2/7 cases.

Then, the third house needs double the first house, so 2 times 78 4/7. Let me compute that.

Double of 78 is 156, and double of 4/7 is 8/7, which is 1 1/7. So, the third house needs 157 1/7 cases.

Let me check if that adds up to 2
