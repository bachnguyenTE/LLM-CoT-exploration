Q: Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard. Then he threw a stone at them, and that scared away 1/3 of that number. Hmm, let me think about that. So, if there were 12 birds, and 1/3 of them were scared away, that means 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, 4 birds were scared away. That would leave 12 birds remaining, right? Because 12 minus 4 is 8, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 12 minus 4 is 8. Wait, that seems right. So, after throwing the stone, there are 8 birds left.

Then, a few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 more birds joined. So, 8 plus 20 is... 28. So, the total number of birds now is 28. So, the answer should be 28.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, 12 birds initially. 1/3 of 12 is 4, so 12 minus 4 is 8. Then, 20 more birds join, so 8 plus 20 is 28. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 28.

**Final Answer**
The total number of birds in the backyard is \boxed{28}.

Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard. When he threw a stone at them, 1/3 of the birds were scared away. 

First, we calculate 1/3 of 12:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]
So, 4 birds were scared away, leaving:
\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]
A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, we add 20 to the remaining 8 birds:
\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]
Thus, the total number of birds in the backyard is \boxed{28}.
