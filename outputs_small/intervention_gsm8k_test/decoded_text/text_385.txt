Q: Lisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?

Okay, so Lisa is part of a choir with 52 members. Half of them are boys and half are girls. Hmm, let me see. If there are 52 members total, then 50% are boys and 50% are girls. Wait, that seems right. So, 50% of 52 is the number of girls, and 45% is the number of boys. Let me calculate that.

First, 50% of 52. To find 50% of 52, I can do 52 divided by 2, which is 26. So, 50% is 26 plus 1, which is 27. So, there are 27 girls in the choir. Similarly, the number of boys would be 52 minus 27, which is 25. So, 25 boys and 27 girls.

Now, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. So, they are only using the 27 girls. But, that seems right. Then, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of 27 can't make it. Let me calculate that.

Half of 27 is 13.5, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 13.5 people can't make it. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 13.5 people can't make it. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 13.5 people can't make it. But, that seems right. So, how many people are left performing?

So, 27 girls minus 13.5 people who can't make it. So, 27 minus 13.5 is 13.5 people left. So, 13.5 people are left performing. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 13.5 people are left. But, that seems right. So, 13.5 people are left performing.

But, that seems right. So, now, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the 3 teachers are joining the 13.5 people left. So, how many people are singing in total?

So, 13.5 plus 3 is 16.5 people. So, 16.5 people are singing in the performance. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, the answer is 16.5 people. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people. But, that seems right. So, 16.5 people.
