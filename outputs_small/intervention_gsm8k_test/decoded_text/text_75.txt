Q: Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels, and each level below is half the size of the one above it. The top level is 16 square feet. I need to find the average square footage of each level. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the sandcastle. It has 4 levels, with each subsequent level being half the size of the one above. So, starting from the top, the first level is 16 square feet. Then the next level down would be half of that, which is 8, right? Then the third level would be half of 8, which is 4, and the bottom level would be half of 4, which is 2. So, the square footage for each level is 16, 8, 4, and 2.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

- Level 1 (top): 16 sq ft
- Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8 sq ft
- Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4 sq ft
- Level 4 (bottom): 4 / 2 = 2 sq ft

So, the square footage for each level is 16, 8, 4, and 2. Now, to find the average, I need to add up all the square footage and then divide by the number of levels, which is 4.

Let me calculate the total square footage first. So, 16 + 8 + 4 + 2. Let me add them step by step:

16 + 8 = 24

24 + 4 = 28

28 + 2 = 30

Wait, that seems right. So, the total square footage is 30.

Now, to find the average, I divide the total by the number of levels, which is 4. So, 30 divided by 4.

Hmm, 30 divided by 4 is 7.5. So, the average square footage per level is 7.5.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Top level: 16

Second level: 16 / 2 = 8

Third level: 8 /2 = 4

Fourth level: 4 /2 = 2

Total: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

Average: 30 /4 = 7.5

Yes, that seems correct. So, the average square footage per level is 7.5.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or something.

Since each level is half the size of the one above, this is a geometric sequence where each term is half the previous term. The first term is 16, and there are 4 terms.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 = 16, r = 1/2, n =4.

So, plugging in the values:

S = 16*(1 - (1/2)^4)/(1 - 1/2)

First, calculate (1/2)^4: that's 1/16.

So, 1 - 1/16 = 15/16.

Then, the denominator is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So, S = 16*(15/16)/(1/2)

Dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 2, so:

16*(15/8) = 16*(15/8) = (16/8)*5 = (3/4)*5 = 15/2 = 7.5

So, that confirms the total is 7.5, which is 15/2. So, the average is 15/2 divided by 4, which is 15/8? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
