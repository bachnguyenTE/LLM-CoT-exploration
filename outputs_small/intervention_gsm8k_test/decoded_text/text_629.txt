Q: James gets a job selling used cars.  He sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each.  The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars.  He got a 10% commission on the profits.  How much did he make?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much James made from selling those used cars. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, he sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. Hmm, that's a lot of money. Let me write that down. Each car is $25,000. So, 10 cars would be 10 times that amount. Let me calculate that: 25,000 multiplied by 10. Hmm, 25,00 times 10 is 250,000. So, he made $250,00 from selling the cars. 

But, that seems right. 10 cars at $25,000 each is 10 times 25,000, which is 250,000. Yeah, that makes sense. 

Now, the company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. So, the company bought the cars for 30% of $25,000 each. Let me figure out how much that is. 

First, 30% of 25,000. To calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 30% is 0.30. So, 0.30 multiplied by 25,000. Let me do that multiplication. 

25,000 times 0.30. Hmm, 25,000 times 0 is 7,500, and 25,000 times 0.30 is 7,500. Wait, that seems right. So, 25,000 times 0.30 is 7,500. So, the company paid $7,500 for the cars. 

Okay, so James sold the cars for a total of $250,000 and spent $7,500 on acquiring them. So, his profit is the selling price minus the cost price. Let me subtract the two: 250,000 minus 7,500. 

250,000 minus 7,500 is 242,500. So, his profit is $242,500. 

Now, he got a 10% commission on the profits. So, he gets 10% of $242,500. Let me calculate that. 

10% of 242,500 is 0.10 times 242,500. That's straightforward. 0.10 times 242,500 is 24,250. So, he makes $24,250 as a commission. 

Therefore, to find out how much James made in total, I need to add his profit and his commission. So, his total earnings are 242,500 plus 24,250. 

Let me add those two numbers: 242,500 plus 24,250. 

242,500 plus 24,250. Let me add the thousands first: 242,000 plus 24,000 is 266,000. Then, the remaining 500 plus 250 is 750. So, adding those together, 266,000 plus 750 is 266,750. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 242,500 plus 24,250 is 266,7500. So, James made $266,750. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, 10 cars at $25,000 each: 10 times 25,000 is 250,000. That's correct. 

Company paid 30% of that: 0.30 times 250,000 is 7,500. That's correct. 

Profit is 250,000 minus 7,500, which is 242,500. Correct. 

10% commission on that profit: 0.10 times 242,500 is 24,250. Correct. 

Total earnings: 242,500 plus 24,250 is 2
