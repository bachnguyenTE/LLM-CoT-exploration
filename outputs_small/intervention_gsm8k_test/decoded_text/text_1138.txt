Q: Melanie's father opens up an animal farm starting with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day and Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day, for three weeks. What's the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Melanie's father who opened an animal farm. Let me try to understand what's going on here. The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Then, there are two more sources of animals: Milkie Cows Limited brings in 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings in 10 chickens per day. This is for three weeks. I need to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the initial number of animals is 50 cows and 20 chickens. So that's 50 + 20 = 70 animals. Got that.

Now, Milkie Cows Limited is bringing in cows. They add 20 cows each day. Broilers Limited is bringing in chickens at 10 per day. So, each day, the number of cows increases by 20, and the number of chickens increases by 10.

Wait, that seems right. So, over three weeks, which is 21 days, each source will bring in their respective number of animals each day. So, I need to calculate how many cows and chickens are added over 21 days and then add that to the initial count.

Let me write this out step by step.

First, initial number of cows: 50.

Initial number of chickens: 20.

Daily cow addition: 20.

Daily chicken addition: 10.

Number of days: 21.

So, total cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 42 cows.

Total chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 20 chickens.

Therefore, total cows after three weeks: 50 + 42 = 92 cows.

Total chickens after three weeks: 20 + 20 = 40 chickens.

Total number of animals: 92 + 40 = 132 animals.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Starting with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Each day, 20 cows and 10 chickens are added.

Over 21 days, cows added: 20*21=420.

Chickens added:10*21=210.

Wait, that seems right. So, 50 + 420=92 cows.

20 +210=230 chickens.

92 +230=132 animals.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of animals is 132.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the initial number is 70 animals. Then, each day, 30 animals are added (20 cows +10 chickens). So, over 21 days, 30*21=630 animals added. So, 70 +630=700 animals.
