Q: Two cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars on a highway. The first car is going at 60 miles per hour, and the second one is going faster, at 70 miles per hour. They pass each other, and then both keep going at their constant speeds. The question is asking how many miles apart they'll be after 2 hours. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that speed is distance over time, so speed = distance / time. But, that seems right. So, if both cars are moving, their speeds will determine how far they go in a certain amount of time. Since they're moving in the same direction, the second car is going to be catching up to the first one, right? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, after 2 hours, the second car will have passed the first one and will be ahead by some distance.

Wait, that seems right. So, the key here is to figure out how much distance the second car gains on the first car in those 2 hours. Because if the second car is going faster, it will cover more ground than the first car in the same amount of time, so the difference in their distances will be the distance between them after 2 hours.

So, let me break it down. The first car is going at 60 mph, and the second at 70 mph. So, the second car is going 70 - 60 = 10 mph faster than the first car. That makes sense. So, every hour, the second car is gaining 10 miles on the first car. Therefore, over 2 hours, the total distance the second car will have gained is 10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. So, the distance between them will be 20 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me verify. Let's calculate how far each car has traveled in 2 hours.

First car: 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.

Second car: 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles.

So, the distance between them is 140 - 120 = 20 miles. Yeah, that matches what I thought earlier.

So, the answer is 20 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, the key was to find the relative speed between the two cars, which is the difference in their speeds, and then multiply that by the time to get the distance between them.

So, relative speed = 70 - 60 = 10 mph.

Distance apart = relative speed * time = 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

Yep, that's consistent.

So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be \boxed{20} miles.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 60 \text{ mph} = 10 \text{ mph} \]

After 2 hours, the distance between the two cars will be the relative speed multiplied by the time:

\[ 10 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours will be \boxed{20} miles.
