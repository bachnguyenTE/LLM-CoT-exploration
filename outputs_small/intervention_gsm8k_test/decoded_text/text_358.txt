Q: Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops that cost 25 cents each, so the total cost per day is 4 multiplied by 00.25 dollars.

Next, I'll calculate the daily savings by subtracting the total cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money of 5 dollars.

After finding the daily savings, I'll multiply this amount by 5 to find out how much she saves over 5 days.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the daily cost of lollipops:**
   
   Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 4 \times 0.25\,\text{dollars} = 1\,\text{dollar}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily savings:**
   
   Marisa saves the change from her pocket money.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily savings} = 5\,\text{dollars} - 1\,\text{dollar} = 4\,\text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total savings over 5 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 4\,\text{dollars/day} \times 5\,\text{days} = 20\,\text{dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20\,\text{dollars}}
\]
