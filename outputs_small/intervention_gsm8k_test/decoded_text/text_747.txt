Q: A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a tomato vendor who wants to switch vendors. Let me try to figure out how much he saves in a week. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. That's his daily production or sale volume. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, but, that seems right. Now, he's switching to a new vendor who sells them for $0.4 each. So, he's going to save some money each day, and we need to find out how much he saves in a week.

Alright, so let's think about the daily savings. If he used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, how much did he spend daily before switching? And now, with the new vendor, he's buying them at $0.4 each. So, the difference between these two amounts will be his daily savings. Then, to find out his weekly savings, we can multiply the daily savings by seven days.

Let me write this down to make it clearer.

First, calculate the daily cost before switching:
Number of tomatoes sold per day = 500
Price per tomato before = $0.5
So, daily cost before = 500 * 0.5

Let me compute that. 500 multiplied by 0.5. Hmm, 500 divided by 2 is 250. So, he used to spend $250 each day.

Now, calculate the daily cost after switching:
Price per tomato after = $0.4
So, daily cost after = 500 * 0.4

Calculating that: 500 multiplied by 0.4. Hmm, 500 * 0.4 is the same as 500 * 2/5, which is 200. So, he now spends $200 each day.

So, the daily savings would be the difference between the two daily costs. That is, 250 - 200 = $50 saved each day.

Now, to find out how much he saves in a week, we need to multiply the daily savings by 7 days.

So, weekly savings = 50 * 7

Calculating that: 50 * 7 is 350.

Therefore, he saves $350 a week by switching vendors.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each: 500 * 0.5 is indeed 250. Then, 500 tomatoes at $0.4 each: 500 * 0.4 is 200. The difference is 50, so that's correct. Then, 50 per day times 7 days is 350. Yeah, that seems solid.

I don't think I made any errors here. So, the answer should be $350 saved per week.

**Final Answer**
The tomato vendor saves \boxed{350} dollars a week.

The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each and now switches to a new vendor who sells them for $0.4 each. 

First, calculate the daily cost before switching:
\[
500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250
\]

Next, calculate the daily cost after switching:
\[
500 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200
\]

The daily savings is the difference between the two daily costs:
\[
\$250 - \$200 = \$50
\]

To find the weekly savings, multiply the daily savings by 7:
\[
\$55 \times 7 = \$385
\]

However, upon re-evaluating the calculations, it was found that the correct daily savings is $50, leading to:
\[
\$50 \times 7 = \$350
\]

Thus, the tomato vendor saves \boxed{350} dollars a week.
