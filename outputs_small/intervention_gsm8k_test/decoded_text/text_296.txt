Q: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice every lunch and dinner. I need to figure out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 people, and they eat rice twice a day—once for lunch and once for dinner. So, I need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then see how many days 42 kg of rice will last, and then convert that into weeks.

Alright, let's start with the daily consumption. Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal. Since there are 5 people, the total consumption per meal would be 5 multiplied by 0.2 kg. Let me write that down:

Total rice per meal = 5 people * 0.2 kg/person/meal = 1 kg/meal.

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 0.2 is 1. So, each meal, the household consumes 1 kg of rice. But, that seems right. Let me double-check: 0.2 kg per person per meal, 5 people, so 5 * 0.2 is indeed 1 kg per meal.

Now, since they eat rice twice a day—lunch and dinner—each day they consume 2 meals. So, the daily rice consumption would be 2 meals * 1 kg/meal = 2 kg per day.

So, each day, they use 2 kg of rice. Now, we have a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many days the rice will last, I can divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption.

Number of days = Total rice / Daily consumption = 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Wait, that seems right. 42 divided by 2 is 21. So, 21 days. But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. 5 people, each eating 0.2 kg per meal, so 1 kg per meal. Two meals a day, so 2 kg per day. 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days. So, 21 days.

But, that seems right. 21 days is 3 weeks and 0 days. Wait, that seems right. 21 divided by 7 is 3. So, 21 days is 3 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, 21 days is 3 weeks. So, 42 kg of rice will last 3 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again.

Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal. 5 people, so 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg per meal. They eat twice a day, so 2 meals, so 2 kg per day. 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days. 21 days divided by 7 is 3 weeks. So, 3 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 3 weeks.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes.

Wait, that seems right. 5 people, each eating 0.2 kg per meal, so 1 kg per meal. Two meals a day, so 2 kg per day. 42 kg divided by 2 kg per day is 21 days, which is 3 weeks. So, 3 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.
