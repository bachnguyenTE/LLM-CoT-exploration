Q: Every month, Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if there are 4 weeks in a month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the weekly cost for Madeline's dog food. The food costs $25 per week.

Next, I'll calculate the monthly cost for food by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4. So, 4 weeks multiplied by $25 per week equals $100 per month.

Then, I'll add the monthly cost for treats, which is $200, to the monthly food cost. This gives a total of $120 per month for food and treats.

After that, I'll add the monthly cost for medicine, which is $100, to the previous total. This brings the total monthly cost to $220.

Finally, to find the annual cost, I'll multiply the monthly total by 12, resulting in $2640 per year.

To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog's annual expenses, let's break down the costs month by month and then annualize them.

### Monthly Costs:
1. **Food:**
   - **Cost per week:** \$25
   - **Number of weeks in a month:** 4
   - **Total monthly cost for food:** 
     \[
     25 \, \!00 \times 4 = 100
     \]
   
2. **Treats:**
   - **Cost per month:** \$200
   - **Total monthly cost for treats:** 
     \[
     200
     \]
   
3. **Medicine:**
   - **Cost per month:** \$100
   - **Total monthly cost for medicine:** 
     \[
     100
     \]

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   \[
   100 \, (\text{food}) + 200 \, \!00 + 100 = 400
   \]

### Annual Costs:
- **Total monthly cost:** \$400
- **Number of months in a year:** 12
- **Total annual cost:**
  \[
  400 \times 12 = 4800
  \]

\[
\boxed{4800}
\]
