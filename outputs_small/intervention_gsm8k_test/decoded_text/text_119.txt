Q: Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Adrien and Lylah's salaries. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, it says Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Hmm, okay. So if I let Lylah's salary be some amount, Adrien's would be 30% more than that. Maybe I can represent Lylah's salary as L and Adrien's as A. So, A = L + 30% of L, which is the same as A = 1.30L. That makes sense.

Then, four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. Wait, that seems right. So, four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000. So, four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000. So, four years later, his salary is 40% higher than that. So, I need to calculate 40% more than $40,000.

Let me write that down. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, then four years later, it's 40% more. So, 40% of $40,000 is... let me calculate that. 40% is 0.40 in decimal, so 0.40 * 40,000. Let me do that: 0.40 * 40,000. Hmm, 0.4 * 40,000 is 16,000, so 0.40 * 40,000 is 16,000. So, 40% of 40,0000 is 16,000. So, adding that to the original amount, 40,000 + 16,000 is 56,000. So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

Okay, so Adrien's salary is now $56,000. Now, the question is asking for the total salary the two were receiving four years later. So, I need to find Lylah's salary four years later as well, and then add that to Adrien's.

But, that seems right. So, I need to figure out Lylah's salary four years later. But, that seems right. So, I need to figure out Lylah's salary four years ago, and then figure out how his salary has changed over the four years.

Wait, that seems right. So, let's see. So, four years ago, Adrien was making 30% higher than Lylah. So, if Adrien was making 40,000 four years ago, then Lylah's salary four years ago was less. So, let me figure that out.

So, A = 1.30L, so L = A / 1.30. So, four years ago, Adrien was making 40,000, so Lylah was making 40,000 / 1.30. Let me compute that. 40,000 divided by 1.30. Hmm, 1.30 goes into 40,000 how many times?

Well, 1.30 times 30,000 is 40,000, because 1.30 * 30,000 = 40,000. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 1.30 * 30,000. 1.30 * 30,000. 1.30 * 30,000 is 40,000. So, yes, 30,0000. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,000.

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,000. Now, we need to figure out how his salary has changed over the four years. The problem says that both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, but, that seems right. So, we need to figure out how much Lylah's salary increased over those four years.

But, that seems right. So, the problem doesn't specify how much Lylah's salary increased, only that Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, perhaps we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by some percentage,
