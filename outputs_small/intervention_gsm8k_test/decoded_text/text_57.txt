Q: A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Okay, so I have this problem about a wooden bridge that can carry no more than 5000 pounds. There's a delivery truck that's going to carry identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds. The driver and the empty truck together weigh 3755 pounds. I need to figure out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the given information. The bridge can hold up to 5000 pounds. The truck, when empty, plus the driver, weighs 3755 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, the total weight the truck can carry is 5000 minus the weight of the driver and empty truck. That makes sense because the bridge's limit is the maximum combined weight.

So, let me write that down:

Maximum bridge weight = 5000 pounds

Weight of driver + empty truck = 3755 pounds

Therefore, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is 5000 - 3755. Let me calculate that.

5000 minus 3755. Hmm, 5000 minus 3755. Let me subtract:

5000 - 3755. Let's do this step by step.

5000 minus 3000 is 2000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
