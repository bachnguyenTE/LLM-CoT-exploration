Q: Travis had 61 apps on his tablet. He deleted 9 apps he didn't use anymore and downloaded 18 more. How many apps are on his tablet now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Travis starts with 61 apps on his tablet.

He deletes 9 apps that he no longer uses, so we subtract 9 from 61, which gives 52 apps remaining.

Then, he downloads 18 new apps, so we add 18 to the current number of apps, resulting in 70 apps on his tablet.
</think>

**Solution:**

Travis initially has **61 apps** on his tablet.

1. **Deleting Apps:**
   - Travis deletes **9 apps** that he no longer uses.
   - **Apples left after deletion:**  
     \( 61 - 9 = 52 \) apps.

2. **Downloading New Apps:**
   - Travis downloads **18 new apps**.
   - **Total apps after downloading:**  
     \( 52 + 18 = 70 \) apps.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{70}
\]
