Q: Ralph has a record store where people can trade their own records for new ones. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one. 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them. How many old records did the 5 people bring in?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of new records brought in by the 5 people. According to the problem, 5 people end up with 7 new records.

Next, I'll calculate how many old records were traded for these new ones. Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, I can set up a proportion to find the number of old records needed for 7 new records.

Finally, I'll solve the proportion to find that 14 old records were brought in by the 5 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many old records the 5 people brought in.

**Given:**
- **2 old records** can be traded for **1 new record.**
- **5 people** bring in **old records** and leave with **7 new records.**

**Step 1: Determine the number of old records needed for 7 new records.**

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, we can set up a proportion to find the number of old records needed for 7 new records.

\[
\frac{2 \text{ old records}}{1 \text{ new record}} = \frac{x \text{ old records}}{7 \text{ new records}}
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( x \).**

\[
x = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The 5 people brought in **14 old records**.

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
