A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of cookies the Adams family has made, which is 7995.

Next, I'll add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies they've already made. The rainbow cookies amount to 2595, and the oatmeal cookies are 3075.

Adding these together: 2595 + 3075 equals 5670.

Finally, to find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, I'll subtract the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the overall total. So, 7995 minus 5670 equals 2325.

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.
