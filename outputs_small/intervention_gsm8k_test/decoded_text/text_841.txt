Q: Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. How much money does he still need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of Gabriel's desired items. He wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. Adding these together gives a total cost of $10,880.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has available. He has $5,000 from his weekend work and his brother contributed an additional $200. Adding these amounts together results in $5,220.

Finally, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, I'll subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items. This calculation shows that Gabriel still needs $5,660.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the desired items:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$10,\!000 + \$800 = \$10,\!880
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money Gabriel has:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Money} = \$5,\!000 + \$200 = \$5,\!220
   \]

3. **Find out how much more money Gabriel needs:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount Needed} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Total Money} = \$10,\!880 - \$5,\!220 = \$5,\!660
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$5,\!660}
\]
