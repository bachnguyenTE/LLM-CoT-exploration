Q: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about porcupines in a park. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the population is 50 porcupines. Hmm, that's the total number. Then it says the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, I need to find out how many female porcupines there are.

Alright, so if the total population is 50, and the females are 3/5 of that, I can calculate the number of females by multiplying 50 by 3/5. Let me write that down: 50 * (3/5). Hmm, 50 divided by 5 is 10, and 10 times 3 is 30. So, there are 33 female porcupines. Wait, that seems right. 3/5 of 50 is 33. Let me check: 50 divided by 5 is 10, 10 times 3 is 33. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, I need to find out how many babies are born in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, each female will have 4 babies per month. So, for one female, the number of babies in a year would be 4 * 12. Let me calculate that: 4 times 12 is 48. So, each female gives birth to 48 babies in a year.

But, that seems right. 4 per month, 12 months, so 4*12=48? Wait, that seems right. 4*12 is 48. Yeah, that's correct. So, each female produces 48 babies.

Now, how many total babies are born in the park in a year? Since there are 33 female porcupines, each giving birth to 48 babies, the total number of babies would be 33 * 48. Let me compute that. 33 times 48. Hmm, 30*48 is 1200, and 3*48 is 144, so adding them together, 1200 + 144 is 1344. So, 1344 babies are born in a year.

But, that seems right. 33 females times 48 babies each is 1344. So, 1344 babies in a year.

Now, the original population is 50 porcupines. So, after a year, the total number of porcupines would be the original 50 plus the 1344 babies. Let me add them: 50 + 1344. Hmm, 50 + 1344 is 1394. So, 1394 porcupines in total after a year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 3/5 of 50 is 33, correct. 4 babies per female per month, so 4*12=48 per female, correct. 33*48=1344, correct. 50+1344=1394, correct.

But, that seems right. So, the answer should be 1394 porcupines after a year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 3/5 of 50 is 33, correct. Each female gives 4 per month, so 4*12=48 per year. 33*48=1344, correct. 50+1344=1394, correct.

So, yeah, I think that's the answer. So, the number of porcupines after a year is 1394.

**Final Answer**
The number of porcupines in the park after a year will be \boxed{1394}.

The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population. 

First, we calculate the number of female porcupines:
\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 33
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born in a year is:
\[
4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ babies per female}
\]

The total number of babies born in the park in a year is:
