Q: Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden. After 15 days, how many flowers does he have if 5 did not grow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total number of flowers Ryan plants over 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers each day, multiply 2 by 15 to get 30 flowers.

Next, account for the 5 flowers that did not grow. Subtract 5 from the total number of planted flowers to find the number of flowers that successfully grew.

Finally, subtract the 5 non-growing flowers from the 30 that grew to find the final number of flowers in the garden.

**Solution:**

Ryan plants **2 flowers** every day for **15 days**. To find the total number of flowers he plants, multiply the number of flowers per day by the number of days:

\[
2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
\]

Out of these 30 flowers, **5 did not grow**. To find the number of flowers that actually grew, subtract the 5 non-growing flowers from the total:

\[
30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ non-growing flowers} = 28 \text{ flowers}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{28}
\]
