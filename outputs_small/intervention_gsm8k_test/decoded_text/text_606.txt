Q: Every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a car's tires and how many years before they need to be replaced. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that every 2 miles, a car drives its tires and they rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. I need to find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced. Hmm, okay.

Let me break this down. I think I need to find out how many rotations Jeremy's tires undergo in a year and then see how many years it takes for them to reach the maximum number of rotations before replacement. That makes sense.

So, first, let's find out how many rotations happen per mile. The problem says every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, if I can find rotations per mile, that might help. 

If every 2 miles, it's 725 rotations, then per mile, it would be 725 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 725 ÷ 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile. Okay, so every mile, the tires rotate 362.5 times.

Now, Jeremy drives 4000 miles a month. So, to find the number of rotations per month, I can multiply the rotations per mile by the number of miles driven each month. That would be 362.5 rotations/mile × 4400 miles/month. Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me compute that.

Wait, that seems right. So, 362.5 multiplied by 4400. Let me do that step by step. Maybe I can break it down. 362.5 × 4400. Hmm, 362.5 × 4400. Let me think about how to compute this.

Alternatively, maybe I can write both numbers in terms of thousands or something. 362.5 is 362.5, and 4400 is 4.4 × 1000. So, 362.5 × 4.4 × 1000. Let me compute 362.5 × 4.4 first.

362.5 × 4.4. Let me compute 362.5 × 4 first, which is 1450, and then 362.5 × 0.4, which is 145. So, adding those together, 1450 + 145 = 1595. So, 362.5 × 4.4 is 1595. Then, multiply by 1000, so 1,595,000. So, 362.5 × 4400 is 1,595,000. So, that's the number of rotations per month.

Wait, that seems right. So, Jeremy's tires rotate 1,595,000 times each month. Now, each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement. So, how many months until they reach that?

So, if each month is 1,595,000 rotations, and each tire can handle 10,440,000, then the number of months is 10,440,000 ÷ 1,595,000. Let me compute that.

First, let me write it as 10,440,000 divided by 1,595,000. Let me see, both numbers are in thousands, so 10,440,000 is 10.44 million, and 1,595,000 is 1.595 million. So, 10.44 / 1.595. Let me compute that.

10.44 ÷ 1.595. Hmm, let me see. 1.595 goes into 10.44 how many times? Let me do the division.

1.595 × 6 = 9.57. 1.595 × 7 = 11.595 + 9.57 = 11.165. Hmm, 11.165 is less than 11.44. So, 6 times with a remainder. 11.44 - 9.
