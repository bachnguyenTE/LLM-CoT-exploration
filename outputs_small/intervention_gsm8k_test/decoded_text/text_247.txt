Q: Isabelle bought party supplies for her little sister’s birthday party. She spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for the party guests. She split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?

Okay, so Isabelle bought some party supplies for her little sister's birthday party. I need to figure out how much each person—Isabelle and her two parents—paid in total. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me list out all the expenses she incurred:

1. Ingredients for the cake: $12
2. Birthday presents: $43
3. Decorations: $15
4. Invitations: $4
5. Goodie bags: $22

I think I need to add up all these costs to find the total amount spent. Let me write them down:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)

Hmm, let me add them one by one.

Starting with the first two: $12 + $43. That should be $55, right? Because 12 plus 40 is 50, and then plus 3 is 53. Wait, that seems right. So, $12 + $43 = $55.

Next, add the decorations: $55 + $15. That's straightforward, $55 + $15 = $60.

Then, the invitations: $60 + $4. That's $64.

Now, the goodie bags: $64 + $22. Hmm, 64 plus 20 is 84. So, total cost is $84.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check:

12 + 43 = 55

55 + 15 = 60

66 + 4 = 70? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
