Q: Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. How many girl Pomeranians does Jana have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jana and her puppies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, Jana has 27 puppies in total. Two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. Then, one-third of those Pomeranians are girls. I need to find out how many girl Pomeranians Jana has. Alright, let's break this down.

First, the total number of puppies is 27. Two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. So, I think I need to calculate two-thirds of 27 to find out how many Pomeranians there are. Let me write that down: (2/3) * 27. Hmm, 27 divided by 3 is 9, right? So, 2 times 9 is 18. So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, of those 18 Pomeranians, one-third are girls. So, I need to find one-third of 18. Let me calculate that: (1/3) * 18. Well, 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, there are 6 girl Pomeranians. That seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 27 divided by 3 is 9, so two-thirds is 18. Then, 18 divided by 3 is 6. Yeah, that adds up. So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions all the way through. So, starting with 27 puppies, two-thirds are Pomeranians. So, 27 * (2/3). Let me compute that: 27 * 2 is 54, divided by 3 is 18. So, 18 Pomeranians. Then, one-third of 18 is 6. So, same result. Okay, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as ratios. Two-thirds are Pomeranians, so the ratio of Pomeranians to total puppies is 2:3. So, for every 3 puppies, 2 are Pomeranians. So, 27 puppies would have (2/3)*27 Pomeranians, which is 18. Then, of those 18, one-third are girls, so 1/3*18=6. Yeah, same answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, is there any chance I made a mistake in the initial step? Let me see. If I have 27 puppies, two-thirds are Pomeranians. So, 27 divided by 3 is 9, so 2*9 is 18. So, 18 Pomeranians. Then, one-third of that is 6. So, 6 girl Pomeranians. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions of fractions. So, the number of girl Pomeranians is (1/3)*(2/3)*27. Let me compute that: 1/3 of 2/3 is 2/9, and 2/9 of 27. 27 divided by 9 is 3, so 2*3 is 6. So, same answer. So, that's another way to get 6.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2/3 of the total are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of those are girls. So, 2/3 * 1/3 is 2/9, and 2/9 of 27 is 6. So, that's another way to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as percentages. Two-thirds is approximately 66.666...%, so 66.666...% of 27 is 18. Then, one-third of 18 is 6. So, same result.

Wait, that seems right. So, all the different ways I'm calculating it, I get 6. So, I think that's the correct answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using equations.

Let me denote the total number of puppies as T, which is 27. Let me denote the number of Pomeranians as P, which is (2/3)*T. Then, the number of girl Pomeranians is (1/3)*P. So, substituting, (1/3)*(2/3)*T. So, that's (2/9)*T. So,
