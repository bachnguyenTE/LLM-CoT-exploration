Q: Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 multiplied by 8, which equals 56 slices.

Next, I should find out how many people are sharing the pizza. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

Finally, to find out how many slices each person can have, I divide the total number of slices by the number of people. So, 56 slices divided by 4 people equals 14 slices per person.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza} = 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of people sharing the pizza:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of people} = \text{Henry} + \text{3 friends} = 1 + 3 = 4 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Find out how many slices each person can have:**
   
   \[
   \text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ slices per person}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
