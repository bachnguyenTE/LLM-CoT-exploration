Q: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Ron has a pothole in front of his house, and if it doesn't get fixed, it's going to cost his car $450 worth of damage. That seems like a significant expense. On the other hand, the city council won't fix it themselves, and if Ron fixes it himself, he'll get fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. Additionally, Ron has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. 

So, the question is asking how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole. That means I need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then subtract that from the potential damage to find the savings.

Let me list out the costs:

1. **Damage to the car if the pothole doesn't get fixed:** $450
2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance if Ron fixes it:** $120
3. **Cost of asphalt:** 3 buckets * $25 per bucket

I think the total cost Ron will incur if he fixes the pothole is the sum of the fine and the asphalt cost. Then, the savings would be the difference between the potential damage and this total cost.

Let me calculate the asphalt cost first. 3 buckets at $25 each would be 3 * 25 = $75.

So, the total cost if he fixes the pothole is $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $195.

Now, the potential damage is $450. So, the savings would be $450 (damage) - $195 (total cost) = $255.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Asphalt: 3 * 25 = 75. Correct.

Total cost: 120 + 75 = 195. Correct.

Savings: 450 - 195 = 255. Yes, that seems correct.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.

**Final Answer**
The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is \boxed{255}.

Ron has a pothole in front of his house that will cost $450 worth of damage if it doesn't get fixed. If he fixes it himself, he will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance and will need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the asphalt:
\[ 3 \text{ buckets} \times \$25 \text{ per bucket} = \$75 \]

Next, we add the fine and the cost of the asphalt to find the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole:
\[ \$120 \text{ (fine)} + \$75 \text{ (asphalt)} = \$195 \]

The potential damage to the car is $450. Therefore, the savings by fixing the pothole is:
\[ \$450 \text{ (damage)} - \$195 \text{ (total cost)} = \$255 \]

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is \boxed{255}.
