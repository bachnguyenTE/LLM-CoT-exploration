A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, and then started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour. The question is asking how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. Teddy worked on two different puzzles. The first one was a 500-piece puzzle, and he finished half of it. Then, he started another puzzle, which was 500 pieces, and finished it within an hour. So, we need to find out how many pieces he placed during that hour.

Alright, so let's break it down. The first puzzle is 500 pieces. He finished half of it. So, half of 500 is... let me calculate that. Half of 500 is 250. So, he placed 250 pieces on the first puzzle.

Then, he started the second puzzle, which is also 500 pieces, and finished it. So, he placed all 500 pieces on the second puzzle.

Now, the question is, how many pieces did he place during that hour? So, we need to add the pieces from both puzzles he worked on during that hour.

Wait, that seems right. So, he placed 250 pieces on the first puzzle and 500 pieces on the second puzzle. So, total pieces placed during the hour would be 250 + 500.

Let me add those numbers. 250 plus 500. Hmm, 250 + 500. Let's see, 250 + 500 is 750, right? So, 250 + 500 is also 750. So, that would be 750 pieces.

Wait, that seems right. So, he placed 250 pieces on the first half of the first puzzle and 500 pieces on the second puzzle, totaling 750 pieces in an hour.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The first puzzle is 500 pieces, half is 250, so he placed 250 pieces on the first puzzle. Then, he started the second puzzle, which is 500 pieces, and finished it, so he placed 500 pieces on the second puzzle. So, 250 + 500 is 750. So, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 750 pieces. So, 750.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, half of 500 is 250, so he placed 250 on the first puzzle. Then, he worked on the second puzzle, which is 500, and finished it, so he placed 500 on the second puzzle. So, 250 + 500 is 750. So, 750 pieces in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 750.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is \boxed{750}.

Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle, placing all 500 pieces. 

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \]

Thus, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is \(\boxed{750}\).
