Okay, so I have this problem here about a train with 172 people on it. Then, at the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. After that, at the next stop, another 38 people get off. I need to figure out how many people are on the train after these stops. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the train starts with 172 people. That's straightforward. Now, at the first stop, 47 people get off. So, I should subtract 47 from 172 to find out how many are left after that. Let me do the math: 172 minus 47. Hmm, 172 minus 40 is 168, and then minus 3 more is 165. So, after the first stop, there are 165 people on the train.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 47 is a bit less than half of 172, so subtracting that should leave a decent number. Okay, moving on on. Then, at the first stop, 13 more people get on. So, I need to add 13 to the current number of people on the train, which is 165. Let me calculate that: 165 plus 13. 165 plus 10 is 175, and then plus 3 is 178. So, after the first stop, there are 178 people on the train.

Wait, that seems right. So, 172 minus 47 is 165, plus 13 is 178. Okay, moving on to the next stop. At the next stop, another 38 people get off. So, I need to subtract 38 from 178. Let me do that: 178 minus 38. Hmm, 178 minus 30 is 148, and then minus 8 more is 140. So, after the second stop, there are 140 people on the train.

Wait, that seems right. So, 178 minus 38 is 140, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 178 minus 38 is 140? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
