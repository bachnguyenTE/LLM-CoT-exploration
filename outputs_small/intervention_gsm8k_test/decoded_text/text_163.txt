Q: In a room, there are various toys: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll. The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of each type of toy. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. Therefore, the doll costs 3 times $5, which is $15.

Next, I know that each red car costs $4. There are 5 red cars, so the total cost for all the red cars is 5 multiplied by $4, which equals $20.

The action figures are already given as $5 each, and there are 3 of them, so their total cost is 3 times $5, which is $15.

Finally, to find the total cost of all the toys, I add the cost of the dolls, red cars, and action figures together: $15 (doll) + $20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) equals $50.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the cost of each type of toy and then find the total cost of all the toys.

1. **Cost of the Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs \$5.
   - Therefore, the cost of the doll is:
     \[
     3 \times \$5 = \$15
     \]

2. **Cost of the Red Cars:**
   - Each red car costs \$4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all the red cars is:
     \[
     5 \times \$4 = \$20
     \]

3. **Cost of the Action Figures:**
   - Each action figure costs \$5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all the action figures is:
     \[
     3 \times \$5 = \$15
     \]

4. **Total Cost of All Toys:**
   - Add the costs of the doll, red cars, and action figures:
     \[
     \$15 (\text{doll}) + \$20 (\text{red cars}) + \$15 (\text{action figures}) = \$50
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
