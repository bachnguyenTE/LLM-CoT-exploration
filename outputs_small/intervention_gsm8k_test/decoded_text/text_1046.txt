Okay, so I have this problem here: A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's asking for the total number of hours each painter worked. So, I guess I need to calculate the total work done by all the painters combined and then divide that by the number of painters to find out how much each one contributed.

Alright, let's break it down. The team consists of 4 painters. They worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks. I need to find the total hours each painter worked.

Wait, that seems right. So, first, I should figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. Since a week has 7 days, 3 weeks would be 3 times 7, which is 21 days. Let me write that down: 3 weeks = 3 * 7 = 21 days.

So, the painters worked for 21 days in total. Each day, they worked 3/8 of a day. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of days they worked, which is 21 days, and then multiply that by the fraction of of a day they worked each day.

Wait, that seems right. So, total work done in days is 21 days. Each day, they worked 3/8 of a day. So, total work in days is 21 * (3/8). Let me compute that.

21 multiplied by 3 is 63, and 63 divided by 8 is... let me see, 8 goes into 63 seven times with a remainder of 7, so that's 7 and 7/8 days. So, 7.875 days in total.

But, that seems right. So, 21 days times 3/8 is 63/8 days, which is 7.875 days.

Now, I need to convert this total work time into hours because the question is asking for hours. So, how many hours are in 7.875 days?

I know that 1 day is 24 hours, so I can multiply 7.875 by 24 to get the total hours.

Let me compute that. 7.875 * 24. Hmm, let's break that down.

First, 7 * 24 is 168. Then, 0.875 *24. Let me compute 0.875 *24.

0.875 is the same as 7/8, right? So, 7/8 *24. 24 divided by 8 is 3, so 7 *3 is 21. So, 0.875 *24 is 21.

So, adding that to the 168, we get 168 +21=189 hours.

So, the total work done is 189 hours.

But, that seems right. So, 7.875 days is 189 hours.

Now, since there are 4 painters, each painter worked an equal amount of time. So, to find out how many hours each painter worked, I need to divide the total hours by 4.

So, 189 divided by 4. Let me compute that.

4 goes into 189 how many times? 4*47=188, which is less than 189. 4*47=188, so 47 with a remainder of 1. So, 47.25.

Wait, that seems right. 189 divided by 4 is 47.25.

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 3 weeks is 21 days. Each day, they worked 3/8 of a day. So, 21 * 3/8 = 63/8 days. 63 divided by 8 is 7.875 days. Then, 7.875 days multiplied by 24 hours per day is 189 hours. Divided by 4 painters is 47.25 hours per painter.

Wait, that seems right. So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I did everything correctly.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3/8 of a day is less than a day, so
