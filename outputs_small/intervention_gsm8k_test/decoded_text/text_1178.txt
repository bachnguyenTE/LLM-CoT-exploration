Q: Mike bought 5 face masks while Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. How many face masks did Johnny buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many face masks Johnny bought. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

"Mike bought 5 face masks while Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. How many face masks did Johnny buy?"

Alright, so Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought more than that, specifically 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out what "thrice as many as Mike" means. If Mike bought 5 masks, then thrice as many would be 3 times 5. Let me write that down:

3 * 5 = 15

So, Johnny bought 15 more masks than that. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if Mike bought 5, thrice that is 15, and then Johnny bought 2 more than that. So, 15 plus 2. Let me write that:

15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Mike bought 5 masks. Then, thrice as many as Mike would be 3 times 5, which is 15. Then, Johnny bought 2 more than that, so 15 + 2 is 17. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 17. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I can use algebra to represent the problem. Let me let M represent the number of masks Mike bought, which is 5. Then, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, in algebraic terms, that would be:

Johnny's masks = 3 * M + 2

Plugging in M = 5:

Johnny's masks = 3 * 5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17

So, that's the same answer as before. So, that seems to confirm that the answer is 17.

Wait, that seems right. So, is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.

Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, thrice as many as Mike is 3*5=15, and 2 more than that is 15+2=17? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
