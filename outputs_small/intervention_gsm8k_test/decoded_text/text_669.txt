Q: For every muffin, Svetlana needed 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 of a tablespoon of salt. How many tablespoons of dry ingredients would Svetlana need to make 16 muffins?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Svetlana and her muffins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how many tablespoons of dry ingredients she would need to make 16 muffins. The ingredients mentioned are flour, sugar, and salt. 

First, I need to understand the quantities required for one muffin. The problem states that for each muffin, she needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 tablespoons of salt. So, for each muffin, these are the amounts. 

Now, since she's making 16 muffins, I guess I need to multiply each of these quantities by 16 because 16 is 10 times 16. Wait, that seems right. So, for each ingredient, I'll multiply the per-muffin amount by 16.

Let me write this down to keep track:

For flour: 5 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins
For sugar: 3 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons per muffin * 16 muffins

Okay, so let's compute each of these.

Starting with flour: 5 * 16. Hmm, 5 times 10 is 50, and 5 times 6 is 30, so 50 + 30 is 85. Wait, that seems right. 5*16 is 30? Wait, that seems right. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 + 30 is 80. Wait, that seems right. 5*16 is 30? Wait, that seems right. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 + 30 is 80. Wait, that seems right. 5*16 is 30? Wait, that seems right. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, so 50 + 30 is 80. So, 5*16 is 80 tablespoons of flour.

Wait, that seems right. 5 per muffin, 16 muffins, so 5*16 is 80. Okay, so 80 tablespoons of flour.

Next, sugar: 3 tablespoons per muffin *16 muffins. So, 3*16. Let me compute that. 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, so 30 +18 is 48. So, 48 tablespoons of sugar.

Then, salt: 0.25 tablespoons per muffin *16 muffins. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so 16 times a quarter. A quarter of 16 is 4, because 16 divided by 4 is 4. So, 0.25*16 is 4 tablespoons of salt.

So, now, adding up all the dry ingredients: 80 tablespoons of flour, 48 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 tablespoons of salt.

Let me add them together. 80 + 48 is 128, and 128 +4 is 132. So, 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each calculation.

Flour: 5*16. 5*10 is 50, 5*6 is 30, 50+30 is 80. Correct.

Sugar: 3*16. 3*10 is 30, 3*6 is 18, 30+18 is 48. Correct.

Salt: 0.25*16. Wait, that seems right. 0.25 is a quarter, so 16 divided by 4 is 1.5, so 1.5 tablespoons. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, 0.25*16 is 1.5. So, 1.5 tablespoons of salt.

Wait, that seems right. So, 1.5 tablespoons of salt.

So, adding up: 80 +48 is 136, plus 1.5 is 137.5 tablespoons. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
