Q: Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds in the sky while she eats her lunch outside at school. On Monday she counts just 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?

Okay, so Alice likes to count the puffs of clouds every day while she's eating lunch. On Monday, she counts just 3 puffs. Then, each day after that, from Tuesday to Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before. The question is, how many clouds will she have counted in total from Monday to Friday?

Hmm, let me break this down. So, she starts on Monday with 3 puffs. Then, each subsequent day, the number doubles. That means each day, the count is 2 times the previous day's count. So, it's like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 each time.

Let me write down the days and the number of puffs she counts each day. Maybe that will help me visualize it better.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Wait, that seems right. So, each day, the number of puffs is doubling. So, starting from 3, each day it's multiplied by 2.

Now, the question is asking for the total number of clouds she has counted across all five days. So, I need to add up the puffs from Monday to Friday.

Let me list them out:

- Monday: 3
- Tuesday: 6
- Wednesday:12
- Thursday:24
- Friday:48

So, adding these up: 3 + 6 + 12 +24 +48.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3 + 6 is 9.

Then, 9 +12 is 21.

Wait, that seems right. 3 +6 is 9, plus 12 is 21.

Then, 21 +24 is 45.

Wait, that seems right. 21 +24 is 45.

Then, 45 +48 is 53.

Wait, that seems right. 45 +48 is 53.

So, the total number of puffs she counts from Monday to Friday is 53.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my addition.

3 (Monday) +6 (Tuesday) =9.

9 +12 (Wednesday) =11.

11 +24 (Thursday) =15.

15 +48 (Friday) =23.

Wait, that seems right. 3+6=9, 9+12=11, 11+24=15, 15+48=63.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3+6+12+24+48=63.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of puffs is 63.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

The formula is S_n = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a1 is 3, r is 2, and n is 5 days.

So, plugging into the formula: S_5 = 3*(2^5 -1)/(2 -1) = 3*(32 -1)/1 = 3*31=93.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of puffs over five days is 93.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 53 earlier? Because I was adding each day individually, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 3+6+12+24+48=93.

Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 53 before? Because I added them incorrectly.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3+6 is 9, 9+12 is 21, 21+24 is 45, 45+48 is 53. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 53 is the sum of the first five terms.

But, that seems right. So, why is the formula giving me 93? Because 3*(2^5 -1)/(2-1)=3*(32-1)/1
