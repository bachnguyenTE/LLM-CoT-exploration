Okay, so I have this problem here about Kenny selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Kenny has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He wants to buy a ticket that costs $100. He also keeps 1/3 of the cards he sells and goes to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. The question is, how many cards did he start with?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Kenny is selling his cards, getting $1.5 per card. He sells some number of them, keeps 1/3 of those, and uses $50 for spending cash. He needs $100 for the amusement park ticket. So, I think I need to figure out how many cards he sold, then add the ones he kept to get the total he started with.

Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the number of cards he starts with is N. He sells some of them, let's say he sells S cards. So, the total money he gets from selling S cards is 1.5 * S dollars. 

He keeps 1/3 of the cards he sells, so he keeps (1/3) * S cards. But, that seems right. So, the number of cards he has left is the original number minus the ones he sold plus the ones he kept. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of cards he has after selling is N - S + (1/3)S. 

But, that seems right. So, the total number of cards he has is N - S + (1/3)S. Which simplifies to N - (2/3)S. Hmm, okay.

Now, he also uses $50 in spending cash. So, the total amount of money he has after selling the cards and spending $50 is the money he got from selling the cards minus the $50 he spent. So, that would be 1.5S - 50.

But, that seems right. So, the total money he has is 1.5S - 50. But, that seems right. So, he needs $100 for the amusement park ticket. So, 1.5S - 50 = 100.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that equation down:

1.5S - 50 = 100

So, solving for S, we can add 50 to both sides:

1.5S = 150

Then, divide both sides by 1.5:

S = 150 / 1.5

Let me compute that. 150 divided by 1.5. Hmm, 1.5 goes into 150 how many times? Well, 1.5 times 100 is 150, so S is 100.

So, he sold 100 cards. So, he sold 100 cards at $1.5 each, so he got 100 dollars. Then, he keeps 1/3 of the cards he sold, which is 1/3 of 100, which is approximately 33.333... but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he keeps 33 and 1/3 cards? Hmm, but, that seems right. So, he started with N cards, sold 100, kept 33.333, so total cards he has is N - 100 + 33.333. So, N - 66.6667.

But, that seems right. So, the total money he has is 1.5*100 -50 = 150 -50=100, which is the ticket price. So, that's correct.

But, that seems right. So, he started with N cards, sold 100, kept 33.333, so total cards he has is N -66.6667. But, that seems right. So, the total money he has is 100, which is the ticket price.

But, that seems right. So, the total money he has is 100, which is equal to 1.5*S -50, which is 150 -50=100. So, that's correct.

But, that seems right. So, he started with N cards, sold 100, kept 33.333, so total cards he has is N -66.6667
