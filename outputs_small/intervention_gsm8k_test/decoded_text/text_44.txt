Q: Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Okay, so Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles, and I need to figure out his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles. Hmm, so the number of candles depends on the amount of beeswax he has. But, that seems right. So, if he has more beeswax, he can make more candles.

Next, it mentions that one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. Wait, that seems right. So, the cost per pound of beeswax and wicks together is $10.00. So, if he buys a certain amount of beeswax, he can make 10 candles per pound, and the total cost for each pound is $10.00.

He sells each candle for $2.00. So, each candle brings in $2.00. So, if he makes 20 candles, he can make $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 in revenue.

But, that seems right. So, the total revenue is $40.00.

Now, the cost part. The cost is for the beeswax and the wicks. So, for each pound, it's $10.00. So, if he makes 20 candles, how much does he spend on make them?

Wait, that seems right. So, if he makes 20 candles, how much does he need to spend on beeswax and wicks?

Wait, that seems right. So, if he makes 20 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax, because for each pound, he can make 10 candles. So, 20 candles would require 20 /10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 pounds of beeswax would cost him 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.

So, his total cost is $20.00 for the beeswax and wicks.

He sells each candle for $2.00, so 20 candles would bring in 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

So, his total revenue is $40.00, and his total cost is $20.00. So, his net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the net profit is $20.00.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

He makes 20 candles, which requires 2 pounds of beeswax. Each pound costs $10.00, so 2 pounds cost $20.00.

He sells each candle for $2.00, so 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

So, total cost is $20.00, total revenue is $40.00, so profit is $20.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the net profit is $20.00.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is $20.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Charlie's net profit is \boxed{20} dollars.

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles and needs to determine his net profit. Here are the key steps to find the solution:

1. **Candles per pound of beeswax**: Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax.
2. **Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks**: Each pound costs $10.00.
3. **Number of candles sold**: Charlie sells 20 candles.
4. **Revenue from selling candles**: Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is \(20 \times 2.00 = 40.00\) dollars.
5. **Cost calculation**: To make 20 candles, Charlie needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost for 2 pounds is \(2 \times 10.00 = 20.00\) dollars.
6. **Net profit**: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue: \(40.00 - 20.00 = 20.00\) dollars.

Thus, Charlie's net profit is \boxed{20} dollars.
