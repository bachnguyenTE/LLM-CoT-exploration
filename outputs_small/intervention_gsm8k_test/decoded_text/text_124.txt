Q: Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

Okay, so Jennie is helping at her mom's office, and she has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She's going to put stamps on one-third of them. After that, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The question is asking how many letters were in that pile when Jennie began.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, initially, there are 60 letters needing stamps. Jennie is putting stamps on one-third of them. So, first, I need to figure out how many letters she's actually stamping. One-third of 60 is... let me calculate that. 60 divided by 3 is 22. So, she's stamping 22 letters.

Now, she's adding these 22 letters to the pile that's already stamped. So, the pile that was already stamped must have been 22 letters before she started stamping. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if she started with a pile of already-stamped letters, let's call that number X. Then, after stamping 22 letters, the pile becomes X + 22. And according to the problem, after stamping, the pile has 30 letters. So, X + 22 = 30.

So, to find X, which is the original number of letters in the pile before any stamping, we can subtract 22 from 30. So, 30 minus 22 is 11. So, X is 11. Therefore, there were 11 letters in that pile when Jennie began.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If there were 11 letters already stamped, and she adds 22 more, that makes 11 + 22 = 33. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
