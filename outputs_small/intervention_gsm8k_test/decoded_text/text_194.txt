Q: Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and prepared $20 for this purchase. One crayon costs $2. How much change will she get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the 5 crayons Violetta wants to buy. Each crayon costs $2, so the total cost is 5 multiplied by $2, which equals $10.

Next, Violetta has prepared $20 for her purchase. To find out how much change she will receive, I subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she has prepared. That is, $20 minus $10 equals $10.

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change after purchasing the 5 crayons.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost of the crayons:**
   
   - Number of crayons needed: 5
   - Cost per crayon: \$2
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2/\text{crayon} = \$10
   \]

2. **Calculate the change Violetta will receive:**
   
   - Amount Violetta has prepared: \$20
   - Total Cost of crayons: \$10
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$10}
\]
