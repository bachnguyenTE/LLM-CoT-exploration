Q: A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a basket of oranges, and I need to figure out how many are good. Let me read it again: "A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?" Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I understand all the parts.

First, the basket has 25 oranges. Out of these, 1 is bad. So, that's straightforward. Then, 20% are unripe. Hmm, 20% is a bit confusing because it's not a standard percentage. Maybe it's a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be 20%, which is 20%? Or maybe it's 20%, which is 20 percent? Wait, that seems right. So, 20% of the oranges are unripe. Then, 2 are sour. The rest are good. So, I need to find how many are good.

Let me break this down step by step. First, total oranges: 25. Bad ones: 1. Unripe ones: 20% of 25. Sour ones: 2. Good ones: the rest.

Wait, that seems right. So, if I can find the number of unripe and sour oranges, I can subtract those from the total to find the number of good oranges.

But, that seems right. Let me write this down.

Total oranges: 25

Bad oranges: 1

Unripe oranges: 20% of 25

Sour oranges: 2

Good oranges: ?

So, first, let's calculate the number of unripe oranges. 20% of 25 is... 0.20 * 25. Let me compute that. 0.20 * 25 is 5. So, 5 oranges are unripe.

Then, sour oranges: 2. So, now, let's add up the bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Bad: 1

Unripe: 5

Sour: 2

Total of these: 1 + 5 + 2 = 8

So, 8 oranges are either bad, unripe, or sour. Therefore, the rest must be good.

Total oranges:25

Subtract the 8 that are not good: 25 - 8 = 17

So, 17 oranges are good.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the number of unripe and sour separately and then see.

Wait, that seems right. So, 20% of 25 is 5, 2 is 2, so 5+2=7, plus 1 is 8. So, 8 oranges are not good. So, 25-8=17.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the percentages. 20% unripe, 2% sour, and 1% bad? Wait, that seems right. Because 20% + 2% +1% =23%, so the rest are good, which is 77%.

So, 77% of 25 is 19.25, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
