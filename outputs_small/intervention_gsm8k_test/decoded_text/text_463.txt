Q: Ashley's pizza delivery costs $15. What is the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man if she wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, which includes the cost of the pizza and the tip.

The pizza costs $15, and the tip is 1/5 of the pizza's price. Calculating 1/5 of $15 gives $3.

Finally, adding the pizza cost and the tip together, the total amount Ashley should give is $18.

**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip and add it to the cost of the pizza.

1. **Calculate the Tip:**
   
   The tip is **1/5** of the pizza's cost.
   
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times \$15 = \$3
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Amount:**
   
   Add the cost of the pizza and the tip.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \$15 + \$3 = \$18
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
