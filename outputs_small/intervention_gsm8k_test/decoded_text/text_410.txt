Okay, so Sally went to the seashore for vacation and her parents gave her $10. That's the starting amount. She went to a trinket shop and bought some taffy. The deal there was "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." Hmm, so for every pound she buys, she gets another pound at half price. She scooped up 2 pounds. Let me figure out how much she spent on the taffy.

First, the deal is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." So for every 1 pound she buys, she pays $3, and then gets another pound at half price. Half of $3 is $1.50. So for each pound she takes, she's paying $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 per 2 pounds. Since she bought 2 pounds, that would be 2 times $4.50, which is $9. So she spent $9 on the taffy.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she buys 1 pound for $3, then gets another pound at half price, which is $1.50. So total for 2 pounds is $4.50. Yeah, that's correct.

Then, she also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50. So that's an additional expense. And she bought 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. Let me calculate that. 4 times $0.25 is $1.00. So the magnets cost $1.00.

Now, let's add up all her expenses. The taffy was $9, the seashells were $1.50, and the magnets were $1.00. So total spent is $9 + $1.50 + $1.00. Let me add that up.

First, $9 + $1.50 is $10.50. Then, $10.50 + $1.00 is $11.50. So she spent a total of $11.50.

She started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, I subtract the total spent from the initial amount. So $10 - $11.50. Hmm, that would be negative, which doesn't make sense because she can't have negative money. Wait, that seems right. Did I make a mistake in calculating the taffy?

Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. The deal is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." So for each pound she buys, she gets another at half price. So for 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound, and then gets another pound at $1.50, so total is $4.50 for 2 pounds. So that's correct.

So, taffy: $4.50, seashells: $1.50, magnets: $1.00. Total: $4.50 + $1.50 is $6.00, plus $1.00 is $7.00. Wait, that seems right. So she spent $7.00 in total.

Wait, that seems right. So starting with $10, subtract $7, so she has $3 left. Wait, that seems right. So the answer is $3.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure.

Wait, that seems right. So Sally started with $10, spent $4.50 on taffy, $1.50 on seashells, and $1.00 on magnets. So total spent is $4.50 + $1.50 is $6.00, plus $1.00 is $7.00. So $10 - $7.00 is $3.00.

So she has $3 left. So the answer is $3.

Wait, that seems right. So I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
Sally has \boxed{3} dollars left.

Sally started with $10. She bought taffy at a deal where she pays $3 for 1 pound and gets another pound at half price ($1.50). For 2 pounds, this totals $4.50. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each, which totals $1.00. 

Adding up all her expenses:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
