Q: Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, if there are 25 kilograms of rice per sack, how many kilograms does she gave to her cousin and brother?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. I need to find out how many kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother combined. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out how many kilograms are in each sack. The problem says there are 25 kilograms per sack. So, each sack is 25 kg. That makes sense.

Now, Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin. So, to find out how many kilograms that is, I need to multiply the number of sacks by the kilograms per sack. That would be 3 sacks multiplied by 25 kg per sack. Let me write that down: 3 * 25. Hmm, 3 times 25 is 15. Wait, that seems right. So, 3 sacks equal 15 kilograms. So, her cousin got 15 kg of rice.

Next, she gave 4 sacks to her brother. Again, I need to multiply the number of sacks by the kilograms per sack. So, 4 * 25. Let me calculate that. 4 times 25 is 100. Wait, that seems right. 4 times 25 is 100. So, her brother got 100 kg of rice.

Now, to find the total kilograms she gave to both her cousin and brother, I need to add those two amounts together. So, 15 kg (cousin) plus 100 kg (brother). Let me add those: 15 + 100. That equals 115. So, altogether, she gave 115 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 3 sacks times 25 kg is 75 kg, and 4 sacks times 25 kg is 100 kg. Adding those together, 75 + 100 is 175. Wait, that seems right.
