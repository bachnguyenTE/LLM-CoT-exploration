Q: Peter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?

Okay, so Peter has $700 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. That means he's going to spend the same amount every day, right? A week has 7 days, so I guess he's going to spend $700 divided by 7 each day. Let me calculate that first.

So, $700 divided by 7 is... let me see, 7 goes into 70 ten times, so that's $100 each day. Wait, that seems right. 7 times 100 is 700, which is $700, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So each day, he's spending $100.

Now, from Sunday through Wednesday, that's 5 days, right? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Thursday? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, Sunday to Wednesday is 5 days, and then Thursday to Sunday is 3 days? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he's spending on wooden action figures on those 5 days.

He buys wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, each wooden action figure is $5. So, how much does he spend on wooden action figures each day? He's spending $100 each day, right? So, each day, he's spending $100 on wooden action figures.

So, for 5 days, how much does he spend on wooden action figures? That would be 5 times $100, which is $500. So, he spends $500 on wooden action figures over 5 days.

Then, for the rest of the week, which is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, that's 4 days, right? So, he's buying plastic action figures for those 4 days. Each plastic action figure is $2 each.

So, how much does he spend on plastic action figures? He's spending $100 each day, so 4 days would be 4 times $100, which is $400.

So, total amount he spends on plastic action figures is $400.

Wait, that seems right. So, total amount he spends in a week is $500 + $400, which is $900. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he started with $700, and he's spending $100 each day for 7 days, so he's spending $700 in total. So, he ends up with $0. So, he has no money left.

But, that seems right. So, he's spending all his money on action figures. So, how many action figures does he have by the end of the week?

He buys wooden action figures on 5 days, each costing $5, so how many wooden action figures does he get? That's 5 times 100 divided by 5, which is 100 divided by 5, which is 20. So, 20 wooden action figures.

Then, plastic action figures on 4 days, each costing $2, so 4 times 100 divided by 2, which is 400 divided by 2, which is 200. So, 200 plastic action figures.

So, total action figures he has is 20 + 200, which is 220.

Wait, that seems right. So, he ends up with 220 action figures.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

So, he has $700. Each day, he spends $100. So, 7 days times $100 is $700. So, that's correct.

He spends $500 on wooden action figures over 5 days. 5 times 500 is 2500? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
