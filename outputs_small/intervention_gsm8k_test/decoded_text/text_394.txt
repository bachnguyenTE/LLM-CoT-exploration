Q: Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Wendy wants to add 20 more than double the number of books to her shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many books are currently in the system. Since it's a 6x6 grid, that means there are 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of books, I should multiply the number of rows by the number of columns. So, 6 multiplied by 6. Let me write that down:

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books.

Wait, that seems right. 6 times 6 is 36. So, the system currently holds 36 books. But, that seems right. Yeah, 6 rows each with 6 books would be 36.

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. Hmm, okay, so first, I need to find double the number of books. That would be 2 times 36. Let me calculate that:

2 * 36 = 72.

So, double the number of books is 72. But, that seems right. 36 doubled is 72. Now, she wants to add 20 more than that. So, I need to add 20 to 72.

72 + 20 = 94.

Wait, that seems right. So, she wants to add 94 books to the system. But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

She wants to place 20 more than double the number of books. So, double the number is 72, and then add 20. So, 72 + 20 is indeed 94. So, she needs to add 94 books.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. The system has 36 books. She wants to add 20 more than double that. So, double is 72, plus 20 is 94. So, total books after adding would be 36 + 94 = 130. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of books she will need to carry is 94.

Wait, that seems right. So, the question is asking how many books will she need to carry to complete her task. So, she needs to add 94 books. So, the answer is 94.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the question. It says, "Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?"

So, the number of books she needs to add is 20 more than double the current number. So, if the current number is 36, double is 72, plus 20 is 94. So, she needs to add 94 books. So, the answer is 94.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 94. So, I think that's correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the question. Maybe she wants to have a total of 20 more than double the number of books, so the total number of books is 20 more than double the current number. So, if the current number is 36, double is 72, plus 20 is 92. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of books she will have is 92. But, that seems right. So, she needs to add 92 - 36 = 94 books. So, same answer.

So, yeah, 94 is the number of books she needs to carry. So, the answer is 94.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
Wendy will need to carry \boxed{94} books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. 

First, we calculate the current number of books in the system:
\[ 6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ books} \]

Next, we find double the number of books:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 more than this double:
\[ 72 + 20 = 94 \]

Thus, Wendy will need to carry \boxed{94} books.
