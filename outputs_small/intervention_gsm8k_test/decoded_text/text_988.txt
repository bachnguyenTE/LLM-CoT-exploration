Okay, so Jessica makes $2,000 a month. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me check: 2,000 dollars a month. She sets 25% of her paycheck aside to buy fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. So, each pair is $1,000. How many shoes can she buy in a year?

Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how much money Jessica saves each month. She saves 25%, so I need to calculate 25% of $2,000. 

To find 25% of a number, I can multiply that number by 0.25. So, 2,000 multiplied by 0.25. Let me do that calculation. 2,000 times 0.25. Hmm, 2,000 times 0.2 is 500, and 2,000 times 0.05 is 1,000. So, adding those together, 500 + 1,000 is 1,500. So, she saves $1,500 each month.

Now, each pair of shoes costs $1,000. So, how many pairs can she buy each month? That would be the amount she saves divided by the cost per pair. So, 1,500 divided by 1,000. Let me compute that. 1,500 divided by 1,000 is 1.5. So, she can buy 1.5 pairs of shoes each month.

Wait, that seems right. 1.5 pairs per month. But, that seems right. So, each month, she can buy 1.5 pairs. But, that seems right. So, over a year, how many shoes can she buy? Well, a year has 12 months, so I need to multiply the number of pairs per month by 12.

So, 1.5 pairs/month times 12 months. Let me calculate that. 1.5 times 12 is 18. So, she can buy 18 pairs of shoes in a year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 2,000 a month, 25% is 1,500 saved. Each pair is 1,000, so 1,500 divided by 1,000 is 1.5 per month. 1.5 times 12 is 18. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 18 pairs of shoes in a year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 2,000 a month, 25% is 1,500 saved. Each pair is 1,000, so 1,500 divided by 1,000 is 1.5 per month. 1.5 times 12 is 18. So, yeah, 18 pairs.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 25% of 2,000 is 1,500, and each pair is 1,000, so 1,500 divided by 1,000 is 1.5 per month. So, 1.5 times 12 is 18. So, yeah, 18.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 18.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18}

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

First, calculate 25% of $2,000.00:
\[
2,000.00 \times 0.25 = 1,500.00
\]
So, Jessica saves $1,500.00 each month.

Next, determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy each month:
\[
1,500.00 \div 1,000.00 = 1.5
\]
She can buy 1.5 pairs of shoes each month.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, multiply the monthly amount by 12:
\[
1.5 \times 12 = 18
\]

Thus, Jessica can buy \boxed
