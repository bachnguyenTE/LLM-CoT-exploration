Q: The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?

Okay, so I have this problem where the local firefighters are doing a "fill the boot" fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they've already raised $2100. I need to figure out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal, assuming they raise the same amount every hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. They have a total goal of $6300. After 3 hours, they've raised $2100. So, they've already done 3 hours and have $2100. Now, they want to know how many more hours they need to work to reach the total goal of $6300. So, essentially, they need to raise the remaining amount after the first 3 hours.

Let me write down the given information:

- Total goal: $6300
- Amount raised after 3 hours: $2100
- Hours already worked: 3
- Rate of fundraising: equal amount per hour

So, the first thing I should do is find out how much more money they need to raise. That would be the total goal minus the amount already raised. Let me calculate that.

Remaining amount = Total goal - Amount raised
Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100

Hmm, let me subtract these numbers. 6300 minus 2100. Let me do this step by step.

6300 minus 2000 is 4300, and then minus 100 more is 4200. So, the remaining amount is $4200.

Okay, so they need to raise another $4200. Now, since they're raising the same amount every hour, I can find out how many more hours they need to work by dividing the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour.

Let me denote the amount raised per hour as 'r'. So, r = $2100 / 3 hours.

Calculating that, 2100 divided by 3. Let me do that division.

3 goes into 2 once, with a remainder of 1. Bring down the 1, making it 11. 3 goes into 11 three times, which is 9, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 3 goes into 20 six times, which is 18, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the next 0, making it 20. 3 goes into 20 six times again, with a remainder of 2. Wait, that seems right. So, 2100 divided by 3 is 700. So, r = $700 per hour.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 3 hours times $700 per hour is 3*700=2100, which matches the amount they've already raised. So, that's correct.

So, now, they need to raise $4200 more, and they raise $700 each hour. So, the number of additional hours needed is 4200 divided by 700.

Let me compute that. 4200 divided by 700. Hmm, 700 goes into 4200 how many times?

Well, 700 times 6 is 4200, because 700*5 is 3500, and 700 more is 4200. So, 700*6=4200.

Therefore, they need 6 more hours to raise the remaining $4200.

So, in total, they've already worked 3 hours, and they need 6 more hours. So, the total hours they need to fundraise is 3 + 6 = 9 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Total goal: $6300

Amount raised after 3 hours: $2100

Remaining amount: 6300 - 2100 = 4200

Amount per hour: 2100 / 3 = 700

Additional hours needed: 4200 / 700 = 6

Total hours: 3 + 6 = 9

Yes, that all adds up. So, they need to work a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total amount raised is the amount after 3 hours plus the amount raised in the additional hours. So,
