Q: John arm wrestles 20 people.  He beats 80%.  How many people did he lose to?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many people John lost to in his wrestling matches. He arm wrestled a total of 20 people and won 80% of them.

To find the number of people he won, I'll calculate 80% of 20. This is done by multiplying 22 by 0.80, which equals 17.6. Since the number of people must be a whole number, I'll round this to 18 people.

Next, to find out how many people he lost to, I'll subtract the number of people he won from the total number of people he wrestled. So, 22 minus 18 equals 4.

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

**Solution:**

John arm wrestled a total of **20** people and won **80%** of them. To find out how many people he lost to, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of people John won:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of wins} = 80\% \text{ of } 22 = 0.80 \times 22 = 17.6
   \]
   
   Since the number of people must be a whole number, we'll round this to **18** people.

2. **Determine the number of people John lost to:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of losses} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of wins} = 22 - 18 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
