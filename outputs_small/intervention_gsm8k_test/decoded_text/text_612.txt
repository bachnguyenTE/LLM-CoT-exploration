Q: The basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many ounces of meat the basketball team consumed in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes. 

First, let's list out all the players and what they ate:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each weighing 8 ounces. Wait, that seems right. So, each beef tip is 8 ounces? Hmm, that's a lot. I wonder if that's correct. Maybe it's 8 grams? But, that seems right. I'll go with 8 ounces per beef tip.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Hmm, a pound is 16 ounces, right? So, that's 16 ounces of steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals. But, that seems right. The problem doesn't specify how much meat they ate, so I guess we can assume they didn't eat any meat. So, they probably just had vegetables or something else.

Alright, so now I need to add up all the meat consumed. Let's list them out:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces per beef tip. Wait, that seems right. So, how many beef tips did they eat? The problem says "8 beef tips, each an ounce in size." So, each beef tip is 1 ounce. So, 8 beef tips would be 8 ounces. So, that's 8 ounces.
- Third player: 16 ounces
- Fourth and fifth players: 0 ounces each, since they didn't eat any meat.

So, now let's add them up:

First player: 6 ounces

Second player: 8 ounces

Third player: 16 ounces

Fourth player: 0 ounces

Fifth player: 0 ounces

So, total meat consumed is 6 + 8 +16 +0 +0.

Let me compute that:

6 + 8 is 14.

14 +16 is 20.

20 +0 is 20.

20 +0 is 20.

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 20 ounces.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

First player: 6 ounces steak.

Second player: 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so 8 ounces.

Third player: 16 ounces steak.

Fourth and fifth: 0.

So, 6 +8 is 14, plus 16 is 20. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to make sure I understood how much each player ate. The second player had 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The first and third players had steaks, which are 6 and 16 ounces respectively. The fourth and fifth didn't eat any meat, so they contribute nothing.

Adding them up: 6 +8 +16 = 20. Yep, that's 20 ounces total meat consumed.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem. The beef tips are 8 per tip, each 1 ounce, so 8 ounces. The steaks are 6 and 16 ounces. So, 6 +8 +16 is 20. Fourth and fifth players didn't eat meat, so no addition there.

So, I'm confident that the total is 20 ounces.

**Final Answer**
The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \boxed{20}.
</think>

The basketball team consumed meat in the following amounts:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a 16-ounce steak.
4. The fourth and fifth players did not eat any meat.

Adding these amounts together:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces
- Fourth player: 0 ounces
- Fifth player: 0 ounces

Total ounces of meat consumed: \(6 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 20\)

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{20}\).
