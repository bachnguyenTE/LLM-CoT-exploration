Q: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Andrew bakes some mini pastries, and I need to figure out the total calories of all the pastries he baked. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. So, that's 200 of one thing and 300 of another. Each of these mini pastries has a certain number of calories. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each mini cinnamon roll is 600 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin is 450 calories.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each mini cinnamon roll is 600 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin is 450 calories. So, that's the calorie content per mini pastry.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each mini cinnamon roll is 600 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin is 450 calories. So, that's the calorie count per mini pastry.

But, that seems right. So, now, the problem says, "If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?"

Wait, that seems right. So, each mini pastry is 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. So, that means that each mini cinnamon roll is 1/3 of 600 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin is 1/3 of 450 calories.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me compute that.

First, let's compute the calories per mini pastry.

For the cinnamon roll: 600 calories per normal, so 1/3 of that is 600 / 3 = 200 calories per mini cinnamon roll.

For the blueberry muffin: 450 calories per normal, so 1/3 of that is 450 / 3 = 150 calories per mini blueberry muffin.

So, each mini cinnamon roll is 200 calories, and each mini blueberry muffin is 150 calories.

Now, Andrew baked 200 of the mini cinnamon rolls and 300 of the mini blueberry muffins.

So, to find the total calories, I need to compute the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the calories from the blueberry muffins separately, and then add them together.

So, let's compute the calories from the cinnamon rolls first.

Number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200

Calories per mini cinnamon roll: 200

So, total calories from cinnamon rolls: 200 * 200.

Wait, that seems right. 200 times 200 is 40,000 calories.

Wait, that seems right. 200 * 200 is 40,000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 200 * 200 is 40,000. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, moving on to the blueberry muffins.

Number of mini blueberry muffins: 300

Calories per mini blueberry muffin: 150

So, total calories from blueberry muffins: 300 * 150.

Hmm, let me compute that.

300 * 150. Let's break that down.

First, 300 * 100 is 30,000.

Then, 300 * 50 is 16,500.

So, adding those together: 30,000 + 16,500 = 46,500.

Wait, that seems right. 300 * 150 is 46,500.

So, total calories from blueberry muffins: 46,500.

Now, to find the total calories from all pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins.

So, 40,0000 (from cinnamon rolls) + 46,500 (from blueberry muffins) = 86,500.

So, the total calories are 86,500.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 200 * 200: 200 * 200 is 40,000. Correct.

Then
