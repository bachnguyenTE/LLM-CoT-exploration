Q: Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. How many points did Pierson and Nikita have in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Pierson and Nikita's bowling scores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Pierson scored 278 points in one game. That seems straightforward. So, Pierson's score is 278. Got that down. 

Now, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. Hmm, okay, so I need to break this down. Let me think about what "half as many as Pierson" means. If Pierson scored 278, half of that would be... let me calculate that. 

Half of 278 is 278 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 278 divided by 2. Well, 2 goes into 2 once, 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, and then 2 goes into 18 nine times. So, 278 divided by 2 is 139. So, half of Pierson's score is 139. 

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 139 times 2 is 278, yes, that's correct. So, half of Pierson's score is 139. 

Now, Nikita scored 11 more than that. So, Nikita's score is half of Pierson's score plus 11. So, that would be 139 plus 11. Let me add those together. 139 plus 11 is 140. So, Nikita scored 140 points. Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 1 is 140. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, Pierson scored 278, and Nikita scored 140. The question is asking for the total points they had together. So, I need to add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. 

Let me write that out: 278 plus 140. Let me add those numbers. Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place. 8 plus 0 is 8. Then, the tens place: 7 plus 4 is 11. So, I write down 1 and carry over 1. Then, the hundreds place: 2 plus 1 is 3, plus the carried over 1 is 4. So, putting it all together, 278 plus 140 is 418. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. 278 plus 140. If I add 200 and 100, that's 300. Then, 78 plus 40 is 118. So, 300 plus 118 is 418. Yeah, that checks out. 

So, Pierson scored 278, Nikita scored 140, and together they have 418 points. 

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Pierson's score is 278. Half of that is 139. Nikita scored 11 more than that, so 139 plus 11 is 140. Then, adding 278 and 140 gives 418. That all seems correct. 

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The steps are straightforward: half of Pierson's score, add 11, then add both scores together. So, I think 418 is the correct total. 

Just to be thorough, let me write it out in another way. 

Pierson: 278  
Half of Pierson: 278 / 2 = 139  
Nikita: 139 + 11 = 150  
Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 10 is 149, plus 1 is 150. So, Nikita scored 150. Wait, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 11 is 150. So, Nikita's score is 150. Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 11 is 150. Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 11 is 150? Wait, that seems right. 139 plus 10 is 149, plus 1 is 150. So, Nikita's score is 150.
