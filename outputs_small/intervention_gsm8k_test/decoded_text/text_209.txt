Q: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup." Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. It says twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. I need to find the total cost of each cup. Hmm, okay.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the cost of one cup as C. Then, the total cost for twenty dozen cups would be 20 times 12 times C, right? Because a dozen is 12, so twenty dozen is 20*12=240 cups. So, total cost for cups is 240*C.

Now, the other part is the total cost of half a dozen plates. Wait, that seems right. Half a dozen is 6 plates, right? So, half a dozen plates would be 6 plates. Each plate is sold at $6000. So, the total cost for the plates is 6*6000. Let me calculate that. 6*6000 is 36000? Wait, that seems right. 6*6000 is 36000. So, the total cost for the plates is $36000.

Now, the problem says that the total cost of the cups is $1200 less than the total cost of the plates. So, the cost of the cups is equal to the cost of the plates minus $1200. So, 240*C = 36000 - 1200.

Let me compute 36000 - 1200. 36000 minus 1200. Hmm, 36000 minus 1000 is 34900, and then minus 200 more is 34700. So, 240*C = 34700.

Now, to find the cost of each cup, I need to divide 34700 by 240. Let me do that. 34700 divided by 240. Hmm, let me see. 240 goes into 34700 how many times?

First, let me simplify the division. 34700 divided by 240. Let me write it as 34700 / 240. I can divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 3470 / 24. So, 3470 divided by 24.

Let me compute 24 into 3470. 24*100 is 2400. 3470 minus 2400 is 1070. 24*40 is 960. 1070 minus 960 is 110. 24*4 is 96. 110 minus 96 is 14. So, so far, I have 100 + 40 + 4 = 144, and the remainder is 14. So, 3470 /24 is 144 with a remainder of 14, which is 144 and 14/24, which simplifies to 144.35.

Wait, that seems right. So, 34700 divided by 240 is 144.35. So, each cup costs $144.35.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again.

First, 20 dozen cups: 20*12=240 cups. So, 240*C.

Half a dozen plates: 6 plates, each at $6000, so 6*6000=36000.

Total cost of cups is 1200 less than that, so 36000 -1200=34800? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
