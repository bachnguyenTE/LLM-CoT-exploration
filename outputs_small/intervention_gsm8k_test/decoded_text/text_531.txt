Q: 48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?

Okay, so I have this problem here about passengers getting on and off a bus. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 48 people on the bus initially. That seems straightforward. Then, on the first stop, 8 passengers get off. Hmm, okay, so I need to subtract those 8 from the total. Let me write that down.

After the first stop:
Number of passengers = 48 - 8 = 40.

Alright, so now there are 40 passengers left on the bus. Now, the next part says that 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Wait, that seems right. So, 5 times 8, which is 40. So, 40 people get on the bus.

Let me calculate the new number of passengers after the first stop. So, 40 passengers got on, so we add that to the remaining passengers.

After the first stop:
Number of passengers = 40 + 40 = 88.

Wait, that seems right. So, after the first stop, there are 88 passengers on the bus. Hmm, that's a lot. Let me double-check. 48 minus 8 is 40, then 40 plus 40 is 80? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 48 - 8 is 40, then 400 + 40 is 88. Yeah, that's correct.

Okay, moving on to the second stop. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, subtracting 21 from the current number of passengers.

After the second stop before any new passengers get on:
Number of passengers = 88 - 21 = 67.

Alright, so now there are 67 passengers on the bus. Then, the problem says that 3 times fewer passengers get on. Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. So, 3 times fewer than... what? It says 3 times fewer passengers get on. So, does that mean 3 fewer than something? Or is it 3 times the number of passengers who got off?

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 times fewer passengers get on. So, if 21 got off, then 3 times fewer would be 3*21? Wait, that seems right. So, 3 times fewer is 3*21, which is 63. So, 63 passengers get on the bus.

Wait, that seems right. So, adding 63 to the current number of passengers.

After the second stop:
Number of passengers = 67 + 63 = 130.

Wait, that seems right. 67 plus 63 is 130. Let me check that. 60 + 60 is 120, and 7 + 3 is 10, so 120 + 10 is 130. Yeah, that's correct.

So, after the second stop, there are 130 passengers on the bus. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Start: 48 passengers.

First stop: 8 get off, so 48 - 8 = 40. Then, 5 times as many get on, which is 5*8=40. So, 40 + 40 = 80? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
