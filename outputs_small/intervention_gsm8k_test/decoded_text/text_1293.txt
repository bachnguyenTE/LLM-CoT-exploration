Q: A company produces chocolate in bars. In one day, it can produce 5000 bars. The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. How much money will the company receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a company that makes chocolate bars. Let me try to figure out how much money they'll make in two weeks. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the company produces 5000 bars in one day. That's a lot! I guess I need to calculate how much they make each day and then multiply that by the number of days in two weeks. Wait, that seems right. So, if they make 5000 bars each day and sell each for $2, then the daily revenue should be 5000 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down.

Daily production: 5000 bars
Price per bar: $2
Daily revenue: 5000 * 2

Let me compute that. 5000 times 2 is... 10000. So, they make $10000 each day. Hmm, that's a lot! But, that seems right. 5000 bars times $2 is 10000 dollars. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the question is asking for the total money received during two weeks. So, I need to find out how much they make in two weeks. Since they make $10000 each day, I can multiply that daily amount by the number of days, which is 14 days (two weeks). Let me write that.

Total revenue: 10000 * 14

Hmm, okay, so 10000 multiplied by 14. Let me think about how to compute that. Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts. 10000 times 14 is 140000, and 1000 times 14 is 14000. Wait, that seems right. So, 10000 *14 is 140000, and 1000*14 is 4000. Wait, that seems right. So, adding those together, 140000 + 4000 is 144000. So, the total revenue is $144000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 5000 bars a day times $2 is $10000 per day. Then, over two weeks, which is 14 days, so 10000 *14 is 40000, and 10000 *10 is 100000.
