Q: Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that 1 Mb has 1000 kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?

Okay, so Ashley has an internet speed of 20 kilobits per second. Hmm, I need to figure out her speed in megabits per hour. Let me think about how to convert this. 

First, I know that 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits. Wait, that seems right. So, 1 Mb is 1000 kb. That makes sense because the prefix 'M' stands for million, and 'k' stands for thousand. So, 1 Mb is 1,000 kb. 

Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second. I need to convert this to megabits. Since 1 Mb is 1,000 kb, then 1 kb is 1/1,000 Mb. So, 20 kb per second would be 20 / 1,000 Mb per second. Let me calculate that. 

20 divided by 1,000 is... let me see, 20 divided by 1,000. Hmm, 20 divided by 1,000 is 0.002. Wait, that seems right. Because 1,000 divided by 1000 is 1, so 20 divided by 1,000 is 0.02. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 kb/s is 0.02 Mb/s. 

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 20 divided by 1,000 is 0.02. So, 20 kb/s is 0.02 Mb/s. Wait, that seems right. 

But, that seems right. So, 0.02 Mb per second. Now, I need to find out how much that is per hour. So, I need to convert seconds to hours. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 times 60 is 3,600 seconds in an hour. So, to get the speed in Mb per hour, I need to multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour. 

So, 0.02 Mb/s multiplied by 3,600 seconds. Let me calculate that. 

0.02 times 3,600. Hmm, 0.02 times 3,600. Well, 0.02 is the same as 1/5, so 3,600 divided by 5 is 720. So, 0.02 times 3,600 is 720. 

So, Ashley's internet speed is 720 Mb per hour. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 

Starting with 20 kb/s. Convert to Mb/s: 20 / 1,000 = 0.02 Mb/s. Then, multiply by 3,600 to get per hour: 0.02 * 3,600 = 720. Yeah, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of unit conversions. 

20 kb/s * (1 Mb / 1,000 kb) * (3,600 s / 1 h) = 20 * (1 / 1,000) * 3,600 Mb/h. 

Calculating that: 20 * 3,600 = 72,000. Then, 72,000 / 1,000 = 72. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 kb/s is 0.02 Mb/s, which is 720 Mb/h. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 kb/s is 0.02 Mb/s, which is 0.02 * 3,600 = 720. So, 720 is the same as 720.000. So, 720.000 is 720.000. So, 720.000 is 720.000. So, 720.000 is 720.000. So, 720.000 is 720. So, 720.000 is 720.000
