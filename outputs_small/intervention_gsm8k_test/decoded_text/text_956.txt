Okay, so I have this problem here about Robyn sending emails, and I need to figure out how many she sends to her boyfriend. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Seven are work emails, and two-thirds of the remainder are to family. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. How many emails a day does she send to her boyfriend?"

Alright, so Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. Then, the rest are divided between family and her boyfriend. Specifically, two-thirds of the remainder are to family, and one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, I need to find out how many emails go to her boyfriend.

Let me break this down step by step. First, total emails: 16. Work emails: 7. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
