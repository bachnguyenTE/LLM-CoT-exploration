A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Andrea saved some money, then she spent the rest on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. She started with $36. The question is, how much did Andrea save? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Andrea had some money saved up, and then she spent part of it on a sweater and gave her brother some money. The total she had at the beginning was $36. So, she saved some amount, let's call that amount "S," and then she spent $11 on a sweater and $4 on her brother. So, the total amount she spent is $111 + $4, which is $15. 

Wait, that seems right. So, she started with $36, spent $15, so the amount she saved, S, must be the difference between what she had and what she spent. So, S = 36 - 15. Let me calculate that. 36 minus 15 is 21. So, Andrea saved $21. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. If she had $36, and she spent $15, then she has $1 left. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she saved $21, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $21. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that down.

Let me define the variables:

Let S be the amount Andrea saved.

She started with $36, so after saving, she had S dollars.

Then, she spent $11 on a sweater and $4 on her brother, so total spent is $15.

Therefore, the amount she has left is S - 15.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the amount she has left is S -15, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the problem is, she had $36, she spent $15, so she has $21 left. So, that means S is $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, Andrea saved $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me think again.

She started with $36.

She saved some money, which is S.

Then, she spent $11 on a sweater and $4 on her brother, so total spent is $15.

Therefore, the amount she has left is 36 -15 = 21.

Therefore, the amount she saved is 21.

So, the answer is $21.
