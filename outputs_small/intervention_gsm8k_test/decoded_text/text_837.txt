Q: Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?

Okay, so Erika is saving up for a new laptop that costs $600. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me check: $600? Yeah, that's 600 dollars. So, she needs $600 in total.

Now, the sales assistant said that if she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. So, that means instead of paying the full price, she can pay $200 less. So, if she takes the trade-in, the new laptop would cost her $600 minus $200, which is $400. But, that seems right. So, she's getting a discount of $200.

But, that seems right. So, she's agreeing to do it, so she can get the discounted price. So, she's going to pay $400 instead of $600.

Now, she already has some savings in her purse. She's been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. So, that's $150. And her mom is giving her $80 to help. So, that's $80.

So, let me break this down. She needs $600 in total. But, that seems right. So, she's going to pay $400 for the laptop because of the trade-in. So, she's going to pay $400 instead of $600.
