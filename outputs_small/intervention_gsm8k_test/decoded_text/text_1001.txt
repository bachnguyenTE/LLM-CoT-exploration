Q: Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?

Okay, so Jordan wants to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake. She needs to figure out the latest time she can start making the cake so that it's ready to serve at 5:00 pm. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the cake-making process has several steps: making the batter, baking the cake, cooling it, and frosting it. Each of these steps takes a certain amount of time. Let me list out the times for each step:

1. Baking the batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Wait, that seems right. So, the batter takes 20 minutes, which is 20 minutes, then the cake takes 30 minutes to bake. After that, it needs to cool for 2 hours, and then frost it for 10 minutes. So, the total time from start to finish is 20 + 30 + 2h + 10m. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total time is 20 + 30 + 2h + 10m. Let me compute that.

First, 20 minutes is 20 minutes, 30 minutes is 30 minutes, 2 hours is 120 minutes, and 10 minutes is 10 minutes. So, adding all these up: 20 + 30 is 50 minutes, plus 120 minutes is 170 minutes, plus 10 minutes is 180 minutes. So, the total time from start to finish is 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total time is 3 hours. So, if she wants the cake to be ready at 5:00 pm, she needs to start it 3 hours before that. So, 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm. So, she can start making the cake at 2:00 pm.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 2:00 pm.
