Q: A bag of buttons had 21 buttons in it. Seven buttons had two holes and the rest had four holes. How many holes were in all the buttons in the bag?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a bag of buttons. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says there are 21 buttons in the bag. Wait, that seems right. Seven buttons had two holes, and the rest had four holes. I need to find out how many holes are in all the buttons in the bag.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the total number of buttons is 21. Wait, that seems right. Seven buttons have two holes each, and the remaining buttons have four holes each. So, I need to find the total number of holes.

Alright, so maybe I can start by figuring out how many buttons have four holes. If there are 21 buttons in total and seven of them have two holes, then the rest must have four holes. So, subtracting the seven buttons with two holes from the total should give me the number of buttons with four holes.

Let me write that down. Total buttons = 21. Number of buttons with two holes = 7. So, number of buttons with four holes = 21 - 7. Let me calculate that. 21 minus 7 is 14. So, there are 14 buttons with four holes.

Now, each of the seven buttons has two holes, so the total number of holes from those buttons is 7 multiplied by 2. Let me compute that. 7 times 2 is 14. So, the seven buttons contribute 14 holes.

Similarly, each of the 14 buttons has four holes, so the total number of holes from those buttons is 14 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that. 14 times 4 is 56. So, the 14 buttons contribute 56 holes.

Now, to find the total number of holes in the bag, I need to add the holes from the two groups together. So, 14 holes from the seven buttons plus 56 holes from the remaining buttons. Let me add those together. 14 plus 56 is 70.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 21 buttons total, 7 have two holes, so 21 - 7 is 14 buttons with four holes. 7 times 2 is 14, and 14 times 4 is 56. 14 plus 56 is 70. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If all 21 buttons had two holes, the total number of holes would be 22 times 2, which is 42. But, that seems right. But, that seems right.
