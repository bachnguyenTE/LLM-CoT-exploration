Q: Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mark taking two tests. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Mark took a test yesterday that had 75 questions. He completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test with 100 questions, also at the same rate. He had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours for the second one. The question is asking how many questions he left incomplete.

Alright, so I need to find out how many questions Mark couldn't finish on both tests combined. Let me break this down.

First, let's tackle yesterday's test. It had 75 questions, and Mark was doing them at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete it. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many questions he actually finished in those 8 hours.

To do that, I can use the formula: number of questions = rate × time. So, if his rate is 5 questions per hour, and he worked for 8 hours, then the number of questions he completed is 5 multiplied by 8. Let me write that down:

Number of questions completed yesterday = 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions.

Wait, that seems right. So, he completed 40 questions in 8 hours. But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 5 times 8 is 40, yes. So, he started with 75 questions, so the number of incomplete questions would be 75 minus 40. Let me calculate that:

Incomplete yesterday = 75 - 40 = 35 questions.

Okay, so he left 35 questions incomplete on the first test.

Now, moving on to today's test. It had 100 questions, and he was also doing them at 5 questions per hour. But, that seems right. He had 6 hours to complete it. So, again, using the same formula, the number of questions he completed today is 5 questions/hour × 6 hours.

Let me compute that:

Number of questions completed today = 5 × 6 = 30 questions.

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 6 is 30. So, he completed 30 questions in 6 hours. Therefore, the number of incomplete questions today would be 100 minus 30.

Incomplete today = 100 - 30 = 70 questions.

So, today, he left 70 questions incomplete.

Now, to find the total number of incomplete questions, I need to add the incomplete ones from both tests together.

Total incomplete = incomplete yesterday + incomplete today = 35 + 70.

Let me add those up. 35 plus 70 is 105. So, 35 + 70 = 105.

Therefore, Mark left a total of 105 questions incomplete.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First test: 75 questions, 5 per hour, 8 hours. 5×8=40. 75-40=35. Correct.

Second test: 100 questions, 5 per hour, 6 hours. 5×6=30. 100-30=70. Correct.

Total incomplete: 35+70=105. That seems correct.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the total time he spent and the total number of questions he could have completed, then subtracting from the total number of questions.

Let me try that approach to verify.

Total time spent on both tests: yesterday he spent 8 hours, today he spent 6 hours. So, total time is 8 + 6 =14 hours.

His rate is 5 questions per hour, so total questions he could have completed is 5×14=70 questions.

Wait, that seems right. 5×14=70. So, he could have completed 70 questions in total.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of questions he could have completed is 70, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
