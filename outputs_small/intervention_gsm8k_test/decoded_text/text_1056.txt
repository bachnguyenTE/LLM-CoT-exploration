Q: Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Greg is putting clean sheets on different beds every week. Specifically, he's using 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed each week. So, that's a total of 5 beds. Now, each of these beds has multiple sheets, right? I think each twin bed has 2 sides, so that's 2 sheets per twin bed. And the king size bed has 2 sides as well, so that's 2 sheets. So, let me calculate the total number of sheets he uses each week.

For the twin beds: 4 beds * 2 sheets each = 8 sheets. For the king bed: 1 bed * 2 sheets = 2 sheets. So, adding those together, Greg uses 8 + 2 = 10 sheets per week. Wait, that seems right. 4 twin beds times 2 sheets each is 8, plus 2 sheets for the king bed, so 10 sheets in total each week.

Now, he has a laundry machine that can handle 2 sets of twin sheets at a time and 1 set of king sheets at a time. Hmm, so each load can cover 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets. But, that seems right. So, each load is 2 twin sets and 1 king set.

Wait, that seems right. So, each load is 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets. So, each load uses 2*2 = 4 sheets for the twins and 2 sheets for the king. So, each load uses 4 + 2 = 6 sheets.

But, that seems right. So, each load is 6 sheets. So, if Greg uses 10 sheets per week, how many loads does he do each week? Let me calculate that.

So, 10 sheets per week divided by 6 sheets per load. So, 10 / 6 is approximately 1.6666... So, that's about 1 and 2/3 loads per week. Hmm, but, that seems right. So, each week, he does about 1.666 loads.

But, that seems right. So, over a year, how many loads does he do? Let's figure out how many weeks are in a year. I think it's 52 weeks, so 52 weeks in a year. So, 52 weeks.

So, 52 weeks times 1.666 loads per week. Let me calculate that. 52 * 1.666. Hmm, 52 * 1 is 52, and 52 * 0.666 is approximately 52 * 2/3, which is about 34.666. So, adding those together, 52 + 34.666 is 86.666. So, approximately 86.666 loads per year.

But, that seems right. So, 86.666 loads. But, that seems right. So, 86.666 is roughly 87 loads. But, that seems right. So, the answer is approximately 87 loads.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, let me double-check my calculations.

First, sheets per week: 4 twin beds * 2 sheets = 8, 1 king bed * 2 sheets = 2, total 10 sheets. Each load uses 2 twin sets and 1 king set. Each twin set is 2 sheets, so 2 sets would be 4 sheets, and 1 king set is 2 sheets. So, each load is 4 + 2 = 6 sheets. So, 10 sheets per week divided by 6 sheets per load is 10/6 ≈1.6666667 loads per week.

Then, 52 weeks in a year, so 52 * 1.6666667. Let me compute that more accurately. 52 * 1.66666667. 52 * 1 is 52, 52 * 0.66666667 is 52 * 2/3, which is 34.6666667. So, 52 + 34.6666667 is 86.6666667. So, 86.6666667 loads per year.

So, that's 86 and two-thirds loads. So, approximately
