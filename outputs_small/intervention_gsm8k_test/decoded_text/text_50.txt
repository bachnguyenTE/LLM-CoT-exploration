Q: Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Lloyd makes from his egg farm each week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that his chickens produce 252 eggs every day. That seems straightforward. Now, he sells them for $2 per dozen. Wait, that seems right. A dozen is 12, so if he sells them at $2 per dozen, that means each dozen is $2. 

But, that seems right. So, if he sells 252 eggs a day, how much does he make each day? I think I need to figure out how many dozens are in 252 eggs because the price is per dozen. 

Let me calculate that. If one dozen is 12 eggs, then 252 divided by 12 should give me the number of dozens. Let me do that: 252 ÷ 12. Hmm, 12 times 21 is 252, right? Because 12 times 20 is 24, and 12 more is 36, so 24 + 36 is 60? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 12 times 21 is 252. So, 252 eggs is 21 dozen. 

So, each day, he sells 21 dozen eggs. And each dozen is $2. So, the daily revenue would be 21 dozen times $2 per dozen. Let me compute that: 21 * 2 = $42. So, he makes $42 each day from selling eggs. 

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 21 times 2 is 42. So, yes, $42 per day. 

Now, the question is asking for how much he makes per week. So, I need to find out how much he makes in a week. Since a week has 7 days, I can multiply the daily revenue by 7. 

So, $42 per day times 7 days. Let me calculate that: 42 * 7. Hmm, 40 * 7 is 280, and 2 * 7 is 14, so 280 + 14 is 294. So, $294 per week. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 252 eggs per day divided by 12 is 126 dozen per day. Wait, that seems right. 252 divided by 12 is 126. So, 126 dozen per day. Then, 126 * 2 is 252. Wait, that seems right. So, 252 eggs per day is 126 dozen. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 126 dozen per day. Then, 126 * 2 is 252? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 126 * 2 is 252. So, that's correct. So, 252 eggs per day is 126 dozen. So, 126 * 2 is 252. So, that's correct. 

So, 252 eggs per day is 126 dozen. So, 126 * 2 is 252. So, that's correct. So, 252 eggs per day is 126 dozen. So, 126 * 2 is 252. So, that's correct. 

So, each day, he sells 126 dozen eggs, which is 252 eggs. So, 126 * 2 is 252. So, that's correct. 

So, each day, he makes 252 eggs, which is 126 dozen, which is 126 * 2 = $252. So, that's correct. 

So, per day, he makes $252. So, per week, that's 7 days. So, 252 * 7. Let me compute that again. 252 * 7. 

Let me break it down: 200 * 7 is 1400, 50 * 7 is 350, and 2 * 7 is 14. So, adding those together: 1400 + 350 is 1750, plus 14 is 1764. Wait, that seems right. 252 * 7 is 1
