Q: Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. She gave the cashier $10. What is the amount of change Theo received?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Theo received after buying a pen and a piece of paper. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Theo bought a pen for $2. That part is straightforward. So, the pen costs $2. 

Next, it mentions that the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the cost of the paper based on the pen's price. Let me write that down.

The pen costs $2, so three times that would be 3 multiplied by 2. Let me do that math: 3 * 2 = 6. So, three times the pen's price is $6.

But, that seems right. Three times $2 is $6. Now, the paper costs $1 less than that. So, I need to subtract $1 from $6. Let me write that: 6 - 1 = 5. So, the paper costs $5.

Wait, that seems right. So, pen is $2, paper is $5. Let me just double-check that. Three times the pen's price is 3*2=6, minus $1 is 5. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the total amount Theo spent is the sum of the pen and the paper. So, that's $2 + $5. Let me add those up: 2 + 5 = 7. So, Theo spent a total of $7.

She gave the cashier $10. So, she gave $10, and she spent $7. To find out how much change she received, I need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she gave. So, that's $10 - $7.

Let me do that subtraction: 10 - 7 = 3. So, the change she received is $3.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Pen: $2. Paper: 3*2 -1 = 5. Total spent: 2 + 5 = 7. Given: $10. Change: 10 -7 = 3. Yeah, that all adds up.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I think the change Theo received is $3.

**Final Answer**
Theo received a change of \boxed{3} dollars.

Theo bought a pen for $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

First, calculate three times the price of the pen:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the paper:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

The total amount spent by Theo is the sum of the pen and the paper:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

The cashier gave Theo $10, so the change she received is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Thus, the amount of change Theo received is \boxed{3} dollars.
