Q: Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Shawna, Aliya, and their father. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: "Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?" 

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to find the age of Shawna's father. To do that, I probably need to find Shawna's age first because the problem relates her age to her father's age. 

The problem also mentions Aliya's age, which is given as 3 years old. So, if I can find Shawna's age in terms of Aliya's age, I can then find her age and subsequently her father's age. 

Let me write down what I know:

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, if I let Shawna's age be S, then her father's age is 5S.

2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. Aliya is 3 years old. So, if I let Aliya's age be A, then Shawna's age is 3A.

Wait, that seems right. So, since Aliya is 3, then Shawna's age is 3 times 3, which is 9. So, Shawna is 9 years old. 

Then, her father is five times as old as Shawna, so that would be 5 times 9, which is 45. So, the father is 45 years old. 

Let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes here. 

Aliya is 3, so three times that is 9. That makes Shawna 9. Then, five times that is 45. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using variables for each person's age and setting up equations. 

Let me try that. Let's denote:

- Let A be Aliya's age. So, A = 3.

- Let S be Shawna's age. The problem says Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so S = 3A.

- Then, Shawna's father's age, let's call it F, is five times Shawna's age, so F =5S.

So, substituting A =3 into S =3A, we get S =3*3=9. Then, F=5*9=45. 

So, that's the same result as before. 

Alternatively, maybe I can write all the relationships in equations:

1. F =5S

2. S =3A

3. A=3

So, substituting equation 3 into equation 2: S=3*3=9.

Then, substituting S=9 into equation 1: F=5*9=45.

So, that's consistent. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the father is 45 years old. 

Is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.

"Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. If Aliya is 3 years old, how old is Shawna's father?"

Yes, that's exactly what it says. So, no, I think I interpreted it correctly. 

So, Aliya is 3, so Shawna is 3 times that, which is 9. Then, her father is five times that, so 45. 

I think that's the answer. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the relationships are not as straightforward. 

Is it possible that "Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna" could mean something else? Like, maybe the father is five times older in terms of age difference or something? But, that seems right. 

The problem says, "is five times as old as Shawna," which usually means five times her age, not the age difference. So, that would be 5S. 

Similarly, "Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya" is straightforward. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct.

So, I think the answer is 45. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if I can represent this in another way. Maybe using ratios or something.

So, the ratio of Shawna's age to her father's age is 1:5. The ratio of Shawna's age to Aliya's age is 3:1. So, if Aliya is
