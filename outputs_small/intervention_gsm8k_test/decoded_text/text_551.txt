Q: Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can.  How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much change Carly gets back after buying these hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, let's see what each item costs. She ordered five hamburgers, each costing $4. Hmm, so I should multiply the number of hamburgers by the price per hamburger. That would be 5 times $4. Let me write that down: 5 * $4. Hmm, 5 times 4 is 20, so that's $20. Okay, so the hamburgers cost her $20 in total.

Next, she bought ten packs of potato fries. Each pack is $0.30. So, I need to calculate the total cost for the potato fries. That would be 10 packs multiplied by $0.30 per pack. So, 10 * $0.30. Let me do that multiplication. 10 times 0.3 is 3. So, the potato fries cost her $3 in total.

Then, she bought five cans of fruit drinks, each costing $2. So, similar to the hamburgers, I need to multiply the number of drinks by the price per drink. That's 5 * $2. Let me calculate that. 5 times 2 is 10, so that's $10 for the fruit drinks.

Now, I need to add up all these costs to find the total amount Carly spent. So, the hamburgers were $20, the potato fries were $3, and the fruit drinks were $10. Let me add them together: $20 + $3 + $10. 

Starting with $20 plus $3 is $23. Then, adding $10 to that gives me $33. So, the total amount Carly spent is $33.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Hamburgers: 5 * $4 = $20. That's correct. 

Potato fries: 10 * $0.30. Hmm, 10 times 0.3 is 3, so that's $3. Correct. 

Fruit drinks: 5 * $2 = $10. That's right. 

Adding them up: 20 + 3 is 23, plus 10 is 33. So, total is $33. 

Wait, that seems right. So, she gave one fifty-dollar bill. So, the amount she gave is $50. 

To find out how much change she gets back, I need to subtract the total cost from the amount she gave. So, $50 minus $33. 

Let me do that subtraction. 50 minus 33. 50 minus 30 is 20, and then minus 3 more is 17. So, $17 change. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify again. 

$50 minus $33. 

Starting from $50, subtract $30 to get $20, then subtract the remaining $3 to get $17. Yes, that's correct. 

So, the change she gets back is $17.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 

Hamburgers: 5 * 4 = 20. Correct. 

Potato fries: 10 * 0.30. 0.30 is 30 cents, so 10 times 30 cents is 3 dollars. Correct. 

Fruit drinks: 5 * 2 = 10. Correct. 

Total: 20 + 3 + 10 = 33. Correct. 

Amount given: 50. 

Change: 50 - 33 = 17. Correct. 

So, yeah, I think that's right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $17. 

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe adding the costs differently? 

Alternatively, I can add the costs of the hamburgers and fruit drinks first, then add the potato fries. 

Hamburgers: 5 * 4 = 20. 

Fruit drinks: 5 * 2 = 10. 

So, 20 + 10 = 33. 

Then, add the potato fries: 33 + 3 = 36. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems
