Q: Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. How many miles farther did Shandy drive than Matteo?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Matteo and Shandy are traveling at different speeds for different amounts of time, and I need to figure out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that distance is equal to speed multiplied by time. The formula is D = S × T. So, I can use this formula for both Matteo and Shandy to find out how far each of them traveled.

Starting with Matteo: he traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, plugging into the formula, his distance should be 55 mph × 4 hours. Let me calculate that. 55 times 4 is... 220. So, Matteo drove 220 miles.

Now, moving on to Shandy: she traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula, her distance is 45 mph × 10 hours. Hmm, 45 times 10 is 450. So, Shandy drove 450 miles.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 55 times 4: 50 times 4 is 200, plus 5 times 4 is 20, so 220. Yeah, that's correct. And 45 times 10 is 450. Yeah, that's right too.

Now, the question is asking how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. So, I need to subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled. That would be 450 miles minus 220 miles. Let me do that subtraction: 450 - 220. Hmm, 450 minus 200 is 230, and then minus another 20 is 210. Wait, that seems right. So, 450 - 220 is 230? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 450 minus 220 is 230. Wait, that seems right. Let me verify: 220 plus 230 is 450. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. Therefore, the answer should be 230 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, Matteo: 55 mph for 4 hours is 220 miles. Shandy: 45 mph for 10 hours is 450 miles. 450 minus 220 is 230. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 230 miles. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Shandy drove \boxed{230} miles farther than Matteo.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. Using the formula for distance, \( D = S \times T \), we calculate:

\[
D_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \,000 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles}
\]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula, we calculate:

\[
D_{\text{Shandy}} = 45,000 \text{ mph} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles}
\]

To find how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[
450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, Shandy drove \boxed{230} miles farther than Matteo.
