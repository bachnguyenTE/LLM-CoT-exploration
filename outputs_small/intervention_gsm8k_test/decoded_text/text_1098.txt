Q: Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha. Martha, on the other hand, is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike. If Mike is 24 years old, how old is Jeff?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jeff, Martha, and Mike. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha. Then, Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike. And we know that Mike is 24 years old. The question is asking how old Jeff is.

Hmm, let me break this down. Maybe I can start by figuring out Martha's age first because the problem gives us a relationship between Martha and Mike. If I can find out how old Martha is, then I can use that information to find out Jeff's age.

So, Mike is 24 years old, and Martha is 4 years younger than him. That means Martha's age is Mike's age minus 4. Let me write that down:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4

Since Mike is 24, substituting that in:

Martha's age = 24 - 4

Let me do the subtraction. 24 minus 4 is 20. Wait, that seems right. So Martha is 20 years old. Hmm, 20? That seems a bit young for a 10-year-old, but, that seems right. Maybe I should double-check. If Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, who is 24, then yes, 24 minus 4 is 20. So, Martha is 20.

Okay, now that I know Martha is 20, I can figure out Jeff's age. The problem says Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha. So, Jeff's age is Martha's age plus 10.

So, Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10

Substituting the value we found for Martha's age:

Jeff's age = 20 + 10

Let me add those together. 20 plus 10 is 30. So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, Mike is 24, Martha is 4 years younger, so 24 minus 4 is 20. Then, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so 20 plus 10 is 30. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. The steps are straightforward: subtract 4 from Mike's age to get Martha's age, then add 10 to Martha's age to get Jeff's age. So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Just to make sure, let me visualize the relationships. Mike is the oldest, then Jeff, then Martha. So, Mike is 24, Jeff is 30, Martha is 20. That makes sense because 30 is 10 more than 20, and 20 is 4 less than 24. So, the relationships all check out.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, Jeff must be 30 years old.

**Final Answer**
Jeff is \boxed{30} years old.
</think>

Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike. Since Mike is 24 years old, Martha's age is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
\]

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Thus, Jeff is \boxed{30} years old.
