Q: John wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?

Okay, so I have this problem here where John won an award at work. The award gives him a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in his salary. He makes $2000 a week, and he gets this raise every week throughout the year. The award was given on the first day of the year. The question is asking how much money John made that year. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the components of John's earnings. He gets a one-time monetary reward of $5000. That seems straightforward. Then, he gets a 5% raise every week. So, his salary increases by 5% each week. He makes $2000 a week, and this happens every week throughout the year. The award was given on the first day of the year, so I assume that means he gets the raise on the first day, and then continues to get the raise every week after that.

Wait, that seems right. So, he gets the 5% raise on the first day, and then every subsequent week, he gets a 5% raise on his current salary. So, his salary increases each week, which means his weekly salary is increasing by 5% each week.

So, to calculate his total earnings for the year, I need to consider two parts: the one-time monetary reward and the total salary he earned throughout the year with the weekly raises.

Let me break it down.

First, the monetary reward is $5000, which is a one-time payment. So, that's easy. Now, the salary part. He makes $2000 a week, and every week, his salary increases by 5%. So, this is a weekly raise, meaning that each week, his salary is 5% higher than the previous week.

So, this is a case of compound interest, where each week, his salary is multiplied by 1.05. So, starting from $2000, each week it's 2000 * 1.05, then the next week, that amount is multiplied by 1.05 again, and so on.

So, to find his total salary for the year, I need to calculate the sum of his weekly salaries for 52 weeks (assuming a year has 52 weeks). Wait, that seems right. So, 52 weeks in a year.

But, that seems right. So, the total salary is the sum of a geometric series where each term is 1.05 times the previous term, starting from 2000.

So, the formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of of terms.

In this case, a1 is 2000, r is 1.05, and n is 52 weeks.

So, plugging in the numbers, the sum S would be 2000*(1.05^52 - 1)/(1.05 - 1). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute 1.05^52. That's a big exponent. I might need to use logarithms or a calculator for that. Alternatively, I can approximate it, but, that seems right. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step, but, that seems right. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

Wait, that seems right. So, the sum S is 2000*(1.05^52 - 1)/0.05.

So, let me compute 1.05^52.

Hmm, 1.05^52. Let me see, 1.05^10 is approximately 1.741, 1.05^20 is about 3.3929, 1.05^30 is about 6.0, 1.05^40 is about 7.04, 1.05^52 is 1.05^44 *1.05^8. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms.

Alternatively, I can use the rule of 72 to estimate how long it takes for the salary to double. But, that seems right. Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest.

Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the future value of a single sum, which is FV = P*(1 + r)^n.

So, in this case, the future value of his salary after 52 weeks is 2
