Q: Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Tasha making money from two jobs: selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Last month, she made a total of $80. The question is asking how much she made from lemonade sales. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand the information given. Tasha made $80 in total. That's the sum of her earnings from lemonade sales and mowing lawns. So, if I can find out how much she made from mowing lawns, I can subtract that from the total to find out how much she made from lemonade.

The problem also mentions two weeks: the first week and the following week. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's. In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. It also says that Joe paid her $6 for her work. So, Joe's work is a separate job, and he paid her $6. That means Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns.

Wait, that seems right. So, Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns. So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, if Joe did, say, x times, then Kamala did 3x times. Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's, so that would be 5x times.

But, that seems right. So, Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns. So, the $6 is from Joe's work, and the rest of the money she made from mowing lawns. So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is $80 minus $6, which is $74. So, she made $74 from mowing lawns.

But, that seems right. So, if she made $74 from mowing lawns, and that was over two weeks, with the first week being three times as much as Joe's work and the following week being five times as much as Joe's work.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me think about this. So, Joe's work is $6, and that's separate from the mowing lawns. So, the mowing lawns total is $80 - $6 = $74.

So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's. So, if Joe did x times, then Kamala did 3x times. So, the total mowing from the first week is x (Joe) + 3x (Kamala) = 4x. Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's, so that's 5x. So, total mowing from the following week is 5x.

So, total mowing from both weeks is 4x + 5x = 9x. And that's equal to $74. So, 9x = 74. So, x = 74 / 9. Let me compute that. 74 divided by 9 is approximately 8.222... So, x is about $8.22.

Wait, that seems right. So, Joe did x times, which is approximately $8.22, and Kamala did 3x, which is about $24.66, and Alba did 5x, which is about $41.11. So, adding those up: 8.22 + 24.66 + 41.11 is approximately 74, which matches the total mowing lawns.

But, that seems right. So, Joe's work is $6, and the mowing lawns are $74, so the rest is lemonade sales. So, lemonade sales would be total $80 minus mowing lawns $74, which is $6. So, she made $6 from lemonade sales.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $6. But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

So, Joe's work is $6. Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as much as Joe's. So, if Joe did x, then Kamala did 3x. So, total mowing from first week is x + 3x = 4x. Similarly, in the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as Joe's, so that's 5x. So, total mowing from the
