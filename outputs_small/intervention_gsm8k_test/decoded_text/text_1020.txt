Q: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. How many bananas does John have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John picking bananas over three days: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. That seems straightforward. So, on Wednesday, he has 4 bananas. Got that. 

Then, on Thursday, he picks 6 bananas. Hmm, so that's another day, and he's picking more bananas on Thursday than he did on Wednesday. So, Wednesday was 4, Thursday is 6. I need to keep track of how many bananas he has each day.

Now, the tricky part is Friday. It says he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Okay, so triple of Wednesday's amount. Since Wednesday was 4, triple of that would be 4 multiplied by 3. Let me write that down: 4 bananas on Wednesday, 6 on Thursday, and on Friday, 3 times 4. 

So, 3 times 4 is 12. That means on Friday, he picks 12 bananas. 

Now, to find out how many bananas John has in total, I need to add up the bananas he picked each day. So, Wednesday is 4, Thursday is 6, and Friday is 12. Let me add them up.

First, 4 plus 6. That's 10. Then, 10 plus 12. Hmm, 10 plus 10 is 21, and then plus 2 more is 23. So, 4 + 6 +12 equals 23. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 4 on Wednesday, 6 on Thursday, 12 on Friday. 4+6 is 10, 10+12 is 22, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 4+6 is 10, 10+12 is 22?
