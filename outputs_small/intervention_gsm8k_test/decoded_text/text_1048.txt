Q: Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007, and it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. I need to find out how much the car will be worth in 2010. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that depreciation means the value of the car decreases over time. Since it's depreciating at a constant rate, I think this is an example of exponential decay. The formula for exponential decay is:

\[ V = P \times (1 - r)^t \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value after time \( t \),
- \( P \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Let me write down the given values:
- Initial price \( P = \$20000 \),
- Depreciation rate \( r = 21\% \) per year,
- Time \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

So, plugging these into the formula:

\[ V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute the inside part first. \( 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \). So, the formula becomes:

\[ V = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, I need to calculate \( 0.79^3 \). Let me do that step by step.

First, compute \( 0.79 \times 0.79 \). Hmm, 0.79 times 0.79. Let me calculate that:

0.79
x0.79
--------
First, multiply 0.79 by 0.79:
- 0.79 * 0.79
- 0.79 * 0.7 = 0.553
- 0.79 * 0.09 = 0.0711
Wait, that seems right. So, adding those together:

0.553 + 0.0711 = 1.264

Wait, that seems right. So, 0.79 squared is 0.6241? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
