Q: Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?

Okay, so I have this problem about Brittany's quilted comforter, and I need to figure out how many square feet it is. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says: Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. So, each square is 1 square foot, right? That means the total area in square feet will just be the number of squares, since each square is 1x1. So, if I can find the total number of squares, that will give me the total area in square feet.

Alright, let's list out the information given:

- 14 red squares
- 4 more blue squares than red squares
- 6 more green squares than blue squares
- 12 fewer white squares than green squares

So, starting with the red squares: 14. That's straightforward.

Next, blue squares: 4 more than red. So, if red is 14, blue is 14 + 4. Let me calculate that: 14 + 4 is 18. So, blue squares are 18.

Then, green squares: 6 more than blue. So, blue is 18, so green is 18 + 6. That's 24. So, green squares are 24.

Finally, white squares: 12 fewer than green. Green is 24, so white is 24 - 12. That's 12. So, white squares are 12.

Now, let me add up all these squares to get the total number.

Red: 14

Blue: 18

Green:24

White:12

So, total squares = 14 + 18 +24 +12.

Let me compute that step by step.

14 + 18: 14 +18 is 22.

22 +24: 22 +24 is 46.

46 +12: 46 +12 is 58.

Wait, that seems right. 14 +18 is 22, 22 +24 is 46, 46 +12 is 58. So, total squares are 58.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check:

14 red, 18 blue, 24 green, 12 white.

14 +18 is 12, 18 +24 is 42, 24 +12 is 6. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
