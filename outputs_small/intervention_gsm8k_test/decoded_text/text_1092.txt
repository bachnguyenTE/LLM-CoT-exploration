Q: A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a Tyrannosaurus rex eating a triceratops. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate it. Hmm, okay.

First, the problem says that the T-Rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. So, let me parse that. If the T-Rex ate half, that means the remaining meat is half of what it had. But, that seems right. So, if the T-Rex ate half, then the triceratops had some amount, and after the T-Rex ate half, there was half left.

Wait, that seems right. So, if the triceratops had, let's say, X kilograms of meat, then the T-Rex ate half of that, which is X/2, and left with X/2. So, the triceratops had X, T-Rex ate X/2, and left with X/2.

Then, the next part says that when the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, after the T-Rex ate, there was X/2 left. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, so they took (X/2)/2 = X/4, leaving X/4 for the Allosaurus.

Then, a group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. So, the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which was the remaining X/4. So, X/4 = 270 kg.

Therefore, to find X, I can solve for X. So, X = 4 * 270. Let me compute that.

4 times 270. 4 times 200 is 800, and 4 times 70 is 280, so 800 + 280 is 1080. So, X is 1080 kg.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

So, triceratops had X kg. T-Rex ate half, so left with X/2. Then, velociraptors took half of that, so left with X/4. Then, Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which was X/4. So, X/4 = 270, so X = 1080. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the triceratops had X kg. T-Rex ate half, so left with X/2. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, so left with X/4. Then, the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, so X/4 = 270, so X = 1080. Yeah, that seems to add up.

Wait, that seems right. So, the triceratops had 1080 kg before the T-Rex ate it.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I interpreted the problem correctly.

The problem says: "A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted." So, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops it had. So, if the triceratops had X, T-Rex ate X/2, leaving X/2. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, so took (X/2)/2 = X/4, leaving X/4. Then, the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which was X/4. So, X/4 = 270, so X = 1080. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 1080 kg.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. So, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops it had. So, if the triceratops had X, T-Rex ate X/2, leaving X/2. Then, the velociraptors took half of that, so took (X/2)/2 = X/4, leaving X/4. Then, the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which was X/4. So, X/4 = 270, so X = 1080. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the triceratops had 1080 kg before the T-Rex ate it.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.
