Q: Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost Rose incurred by purchasing the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. 

Next, I'll calculate the total number of eggs she has. Five dozens equal 60 eggs.

Then, I'll find out how much she sells each group of three eggs for. She sells them at $1 for 3 eggs.

After that, I'll determine how many groups of three eggs she can sell from her 60 eggs. Dividing 60 by 3 gives 20 groups.

Finally, I'll calculate the total revenue from selling 20 groups of three eggs at $1 each, which equals $20.

To find the profit, I'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost was $14.40, and the total revenue is $20.000. Subtracting these gives a profit of $5.60.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   
   Rose bought five dozens of eggs at \$2.40 per dozen.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Number of Eggs:**
   
   \[
   5 \text{ dozens} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   
   Rose sells the eggs at \$1 for 3 eggs.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of groups of 3 eggs} = \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per group}} = 20 \text{ groups}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ groups} \times \$1 \text{ per group} = \$20.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the Profit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$5.60
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$5.60}
\]
