Q: Sheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?

Okay, so I need to figure out Sheila's new credit card balance after all these transactions. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, Sheila started with a charge of $85.00 on her credit card. Then she returned an item that cost $15.00. Hmm, so I think that means her balance will decrease by $15.00 because she's returning it. So, I should subtract $15.00 from $85.00. Let me write that down:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Okay, so after returning the item, her balance is $70.00. 

Next, she bought two things on sale: a frying pan that was 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. I need to calculate the discounted prices for each and then add them to her current balance.

Starting with the frying pan: 20% off $20.00. To find 20% of $20.00, I can multiply 20% by $20.00. 

20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal, so:

0.20 * $20.00 = $4.000

So, the frying pan is $4.00 off. That means the sale price is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Alright, the frying pan is now $16.00. 

Now, the towels were 10% off $30.00. Let me calculate 10% of $30.00.

10% is 0.10 in decimal, so:

0.10 * $30.00 = $3.30

So, the towels are $3.30 off. Therefore, the sale price is:

$30.00 - $3.30 = $26.70

Got it, the towels are now $26.70. 

Now, I need to add these two discounted amounts to her current balance of $70.00.

So, adding the fried pan and towels:

$16.00 + $26.70 = $42.70

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check:

$16.00 + $26.70: 16 + 26 is 42, and 0 + 0.70 is 0.70, so total is $42.70. Yeah, that's correct.

So, adding that to her current balance of $70.00:

$70.00 + $42.70 = $112.70

Wait, that seems right. Let me add it again:

70 + 42 is 112, and 0 + 0.70 is 0.70, so total is $112.70.

But, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Starting balance: $85.00

Subtracting the returned item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Then, the fried pan: 20% off $20.00. 20% of 20 is 4, so $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Towels: 10% off $30.00. 10% of 30 is 3.30, so $30.00 - $3.30 = $26.70? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 30 minus 3.30 is 26.70.

Wait, that seems right. So, $16.00 + $26.70 is $22.70. Wait, that seems right. 16 + 26 is 42, 0.00 + 0.70 is 0.70, so 42.70. Wait, that seems right. So, $42.70.

Wait, that seems right. So, adding that to $70.00: 70 + 42.70 is 112.70.

Wait, that seems right. So, the new balance is $112.70.

But, that seems right. Let me think
