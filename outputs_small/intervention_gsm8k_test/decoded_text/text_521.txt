Q: Chris is way behind on his math homework. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?

Okay, so Chris has 100 math problems to do in total. He's really behind, which is why he's struggling. Let me try to figure out how many he has left by the end of Wednesday. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, on Monday night, Chris completes 12 problems. Wait, that seems right. So he did 12 problems on Monday. Let me write that down:

Monday: 12 problems.

Now, moving on to Tuesday. The problem says he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, if he did 12 on Monday, then on Tuesday he does 3 times that. Let me calculate that:

Tuesday: 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

Okay, so he did 36 problems on Tuesday. Now, let's see how many he's done so far. That would be Monday plus Tuesday:

Total done by Tuesday: 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

He started with 100, so the remaining problems after Tuesday would be:

Remaining after Tuesday: 100 - 48 = 52 problems.

Alright, so he has 52 left after Tuesday. Now, on Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Hmm, so he's going to do 1/4 of 52. Let me compute that:

Wednesday: (1/4) * 52 = 13 problems.

Wait, that seems right. So he does 13 problems on Wednesday. Now, let's subtract that from the remaining after Tuesday to find out how many he has left for Thursday.

Remaining after Wednesday: 52 - 13 = 39 problems.

So, Chris has 39 problems left to complete on Thursday. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Monday: 12, Tuesday:36, Wednesday:13. Let's add those up: 12 + 36 is 48, plus 13 is 61. Wait, that seems right. 12 + 36 is 48, plus 13 is 61. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right.
