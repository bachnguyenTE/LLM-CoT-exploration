Q: Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?

Okay, so Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions. He currently has 600 movies. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, he has 600 movies in total. The problem says that a third of these are in various series. So, I need to figure out how many of these are series and how many are normal movies.

A third of 600 is 600 divided by 3, which is 220. So, 220 movies are in various series. The rest must be normal movies. So, 600 minus 220 is 380. So, 380 normal movies.

Now, the problem says that for the series movies, Mike can get them for only $6 each, which is the cost of a normal movie by buying the series together. Wait, that seems right. So, each series movie is $6, and a normal movie is $10. So, the cost for each series movie is $6, which is a third of the normal cost.

Then, it says 40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5. So, the remaining movies after the series are 380. 40% of 380 is... let me calculate that. 40% is 0.4, so 0.4 times 380. Let me do that: 0.4 * 380. 0.4 times 300 is 120, and 0.4 times 80 is 32, so 120 + 32 is 152. So, 152 older movies are $5 each.

So, the rest of the movies are normal movies, which are $10 each. So, how many normal movies are left? Total normal movies are 380, minus 152 older ones, which is 228. So, 228 normal movies at $10 each.

So, now, let me calculate the total cost. For the series movies, each is $6, so 220 times 6. Let me compute that: 200*6 is 1200, and 20*6 is 120, so 1200 + 120 is 1320. So, the series movies cost $1320.

For the older movies, each is $5, so 152 times 5. 150*5 is 750, and 2*5 is 10, so 750 + 10 is 760. So, older movies cost $760.

For the remaining normal movies, which are 228, each is $10, so 228*10 is 2280. So, normal movies cost $2280.

Now, let me add up all these costs: $1320 (series) + $760 (older) + $2280 (normal). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 1320 + 760. 1320 + 700 is 2020, and 20 + 60 is 80, so 2020 + 80 is 2100. Wait, that seems right. 1320 + 760 is 2020 + 80? Wait, that seems right. 1320 + 760: 1320 + 700 is 2020, plus 60 is 2086. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
