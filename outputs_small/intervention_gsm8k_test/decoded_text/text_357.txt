She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

Morgan's dad said she has $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. 

First, let me note down all the information given:

- Total budget: $90
- Amount for mini-golf: $5
- Amount for arcade tokens: $5
- Number of go-kart rides: 2, each costing $10

Wait, that seems right. So, she wants to spend $5 on mini-golf, $5 on tokens, and $10 each for two go-kart rides. So, let me calculate the total amount she needs to spend on the party.

Total expenses = Mini-golf + Arcade tokens + (Number of go-karts * Cost per go-kart)

Plugging in the numbers:

Total expenses = $5 + $5 + (2 * $10)

Let me compute that:

First, 2 * $10 is $20.

Then, adding the other amounts: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

So, she needs $30 for the party.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check:

- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20
Total: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Yes, that adds up correctly.

Now, she has a total budget of $90. So, the amount she can spend on her friends and herself is the total budget minus the expenses for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts.

So, let's compute that:

Amount available for herself and friends = Total budget - Total expenses

Which is:

$90 - $30 = $60

Wait, that seems right. $90 minus $30 is $60.

So, $60 is the amount she can spend on herself and her friends.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, she wants to spend $30 on mini-golf, tokens, and go-karts, so the remaining $60 is for herself and her friends.

But, that seems right. So, now, how many friends can she invite?

Wait, that seems right. So, the question is, how many friends can she invite? So, the total number of people she can invite is the number of friends plus herself.

So, let me denote the number of friends as 'f'. So, the total number of people is f + 1 (including herself).

Each person will get one mini-golf, one arcade token, and two go-kart rides.

Wait, that seems right. So, each person will consume:

- $5 for mini-golf
- $5 for arcade tokens
- 2 * $10 = $20 for go-karts

So, each person will cost $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Wait, that seems right. So, each person costs $30.

But, that seems right. So, if each person costs $30, and she has $60 available, then the number of people she can invite is $60 divided by $30 per person.

So, number of people = $60 / $30

Let me compute that:

60 divided by 30 is 2.

So, that would mean she can invite 2 people, which is herself and one friend.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 people, each costing $30, so 2 * $30 = $60.

So, that uses up all her budget.

But, that seems right. So, she can invite 1 friend, making the total number of people 2.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 1 friend.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me just recap.

Total budget: $90

Total expenses:

- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: 2 * $10 = $20
Total: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

So, $30 is spent on mini-golf, tokens, and go-karts.

Therefore, remaining budget: $90 - $30 = $60

Each person (including herself) will cost $30.

So, number of people = $60 / $30 = 2

So, 2 people, which is herself and one friend.

Therefore, the number of friends she can
