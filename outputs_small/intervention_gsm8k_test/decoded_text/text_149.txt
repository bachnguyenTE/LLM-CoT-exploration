Q: Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, how many Facebook friends does James have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Charlie, Dorothy, and James's Facebook friends. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Then it also mentions that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. It tells me that Charlie has 12 friends, and I need to find out how many friends James has. 

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out how many friends Dorothy has because both Charlie and James are related to her. The problem says Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So if I let the number of friends Dorothy has be some variable, maybe D, then Charlie's friends would be 3 times D. 

Wait, that seems right. So if I write that out, it would be:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends

And we know Charlie's friends are 12. So plugging that in:

12 = 3 * D

Hmm, okay, so to find D, I need to divide both sides by 3. Let me do that.

D = 12 / 3

So D is 4. That means Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. 

Now, the problem also says that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So similar to Charlie, I can set up another equation here. Let me let J represent the number of friends James has. So:

James's friends = 4 * Dorothy's friends

We already found that Dorothy's friends are 4, so plugging that in:

J = 4 * 4

Which is 16. So James has 16 friends on Facebook. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, I set Dorothy's friends as D. Then, since Charlie has three times as many, 3D = 12, so D=4. Then, James has four times as many as Dorothy, so 4D=16. Yeah, that seems consistent. 

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. 12 divided by 3 is definitely 4, and 4 times 4 is 16. So, James has 16 friends on Facebook. 

I guess that's it. It wasn't too bad once I broke it down. I just had to figure out the relationship between the number of friends each person has and set up the equations accordingly. 

**Final Answer**
James has \boxed{16} Facebook friends.

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 12 = 3 \times D \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Dorothy has 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we set up the equation:

\[ J = 4 \times D \]

Substituting \( D = 4 \):

\[ J = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has \boxed{16} Facebook friends.
