Q: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Freda cooking canned tomatoes into sauce. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Hmm, so if she starts with a certain amount of tomatoes, after cooking, only half of that volume remains as sauce. That makes sense because cooking usually reduces the volume, right?

Next, it mentions that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes she uses contains three tomatoes. So, for every can she uses, she has 16 ounces of tomatoes, and that's equivalent to 3 tomatoes. I need to figure out how many tomatoes she used in her last batch, which resulted in 32 ounces of sauce.

Let me break this down. If each can gives her 16 ounces of tomatoes, and each can has 3 tomatoes, then each can gives her 16 ounces of sauce after cooking, because she loses half the volume. Wait, that seems right. So, each can gives her 16 ounces of sauce.

But, that seems right. So, if she made 32 ounces of sauce, how many cans did she use? Well, each can gives 16 ounces of sauce, so I can divide 32 by 16 to find out how many cans she used. Let me do that: 32 divided by 16 is... 5 and 1/3. Hmm, that's not a whole number. That doesn't make sense because she can't use a third of a can. So, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, that seems right. If each can gives 16 ounces of sauce, then 32 ounces would require more than one can. Let me calculate that again. 32 divided by 16 is 5.333... So, that's 5 and 1/3 cans. But, that seems right. So, she used 5 and 1/3 cans of tomatoes. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, each can has 3 tomatoes, so 5 and 1/3 cans would be 5.333... times 3 tomatoes. Let me compute that.

5.333... multiplied by 3. Well, 5 times 3 is 15, and 0.333... times 3 is 1. So, 15 + 1 is 16. So, 16 tomatoes. Wait, that seems right. So, she used 16 tomatoes.

But, that seems right. Let me check my steps again. Each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes, which becomes 8 ounces of sauce because she loses half. So, each can gives 8 ounces of sauce. Wait, that seems right. So, 32 ounces of sauce is 32 divided by 8, which is 4 cans. Wait, that seems right. So, 4 cans, each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 times 3 is 12 tomatoes. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 16 before? Maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation.

Wait, that seems right. So, if each can gives 8 ounces of sauce, then 32 ounces is 4 cans. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 times 3 is 12. So, 12 tomatoes. So, why did I get 16 before? Maybe I confused the volume.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me clarify. Each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes. When she cooks them, she loses half the volume, so she gets 8 ounces of sauce per can. So, 32 ounces of sauce is 4 cans. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 cans times 3 tomatoes is 12 tomatoes. So, 12 tomatoes.

Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 16 before? Maybe I confused the volume. So, let me think again.

Each can is 16 ounces of tomatoes. When she cooks them, she loses half the volume, so she gets 8 ounces of sauce. So, 32 ounces of sauce is 4 cans. Each can has 3 tomatoes, so 4 times 3 is 12. So, 12 tomatoes.

Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 16 before? Maybe I thought each can gives 16 ounces of sauce, but, that seems right. So, 32 ounces is 5 and 1/3 cans, which is 16.333... tomatoes. But, that seems right. So, 16.333... is 16 and 1/
