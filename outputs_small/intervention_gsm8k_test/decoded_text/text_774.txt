Q: Jack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home.  He drives 75 mph there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.  How long is he gone from home?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Jack is visiting a museum that's 150 miles away from his home. He drives 75 mph both to get to the museum and then back home. He spends 6 hours at the museum. The question is asking how long he's gone from home. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It's about the total time Jack spends traveling and at the museum. So, he leaves home, drives to the museum, stays there for 6 hours, and then drives back home. I need to calculate the total time from when he leaves home until he gets back.

Alright, so let's break it down. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives there and back, so that's a round trip. He drives at 75 mph both ways. So, I need to calculate the time it takes for each leg of the trip and then add the 6 hours he spends at the museum.

Let me recall the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. So, time = distance / speed. That should help me find out how long each leg of the trip takes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to go to the museum. The distance is 150 miles, and his speed is 75 mph. So, time going to the museum is 150 divided by 75. Let me do that calculation.

150 divided by 75. Hmm, 75 times 2 is 150, so that's 2 hours. So, it takes him 2 hours to get to the museum. Since he's driving back, that's another 2 hours. So, the total driving time for the round trip is 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

He spends 6 hours at the museum. So, to find the total time he's gone from home, I need to add the driving time and the museum visit time.

So, 4 hours driving + 6 hours at the museum = 10 hours total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Distance to museum: 150 miles. Speed: 75 mph. Time = 150 / 75 = 2 hours. That's correct. So, going there takes 2 hours, coming back also takes 2 hours, so 4 hours total driving. Then, he spends 6 hours at the museum. So, 4 + 6 is 10 hours. Yeah, that seems to add up.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe calculate the total distance he travels and then divide by his speed to get the total time? Let's try that.

Total distance: He goes 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back, so that's 150 + 150 = 300 miles. His speed is 75 mph. So, total time is 300 / 75. Let me compute that.

300 divided by 75. 75 times 4 is 300, so that's 4 hours. Wait, that seems right. So, total time is 4 hours driving, and he spends 6 hours at the museum. So, 4 + 6 is 10 hours. So, same answer.

Hmm, so both methods give me 10 hours. That makes me more confident that 10 hours is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, he leaves home, drives for 2 hours to the museum, spends 6 hours there, and then drives another 2 hours back home. So, 2 + 6 + 2 is 10 hours total. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods of calculating the total time—either by adding the driving time and the museum visit time or by calculating the total distance and dividing by speed—give the same result. So, I think 10 hours is the correct answer.

Just to recap:

- Distance one way: 150 miles
- Speed: 75 mph
- Time one way: 150 / 75 = 2 hours
- Round trip driving time: 2 + 2 = 4 hours
- Museum visit time: 6 hours
- Total time: 4 + 6 = 10 hours

Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 10 hours.

**Final Answer**
The total time Jack is gone from home is \boxed{10} hours.
