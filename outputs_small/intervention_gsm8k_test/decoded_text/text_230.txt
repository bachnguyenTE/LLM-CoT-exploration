Okay, so Mark is buying a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car costs $20,000. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. Each car is $20,000. So, 12 cars. He has to pay 10% tax on the cars and then another $1,000 for registration on each of them. I need to figure out how much he pays in total.

First, let me break this down. He's buying 12 cars, each costing $20,000. So, the total cost before any taxes or registration would be 12 multiplied by $20,000. Let me write that out.

Total cost of cars = 12 * $20,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 times 22,000. Let me calculate that. 12 times 20,000. Hmm, 10 times 22,000 is 220,000, and 2 times 22,000 is 44,000. So, adding those together, 220,000 + 44,000 is 264,000. So, the total cost of the cars is $264,000.

But, that seems right. 12 cars at $22,000 each is 12*22,000. Let me double-check that. 22,000 * 10 is 220,000, and 22,000 * 2 is 44,000. So, 220,000 + 44,000 is indeed 264,000. Okay, so that's the first part.

Now, he has to pay 10% tax on the cars. So, 10% of $264,000. Let me calculate that. 10% is the same as 0.10, so 0.10 * 264,000. That would be 26,400. So, the tax is $26,400.

So, now, adding that tax to the total cost of the cars. So, 264,000 + 26,400. Let me add those together. 264,000 + 26,400 is 290,400. So, after tax, the total cost is $290,400.

But, that seems right. 10% of 264,000 is 26,400, so adding that to 264,000 gives 290,400. Okay, so that's the total after tax.

But, that seems right. So, now, he also has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car. So, 12 cars, each with $1,000 registration. So, total registration cost is 12 * 1,000.

Let me calculate that. 12 * 1,000 is 12,000. So, $12,000 for registration.

So, now, we have to add that to the total after tax. So, total cost is 290,400 + 12,000.

Let me add those together. 290,400 + 12,000. 290,400 + 10,000 is 30,000, and then +2,000 is 32,000. Wait, that seems right. 290,400 + 12,000 is 306,4000? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 290,400 + 12,000 is 306,400? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 290,400 + 12,000 is 302,400? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that
