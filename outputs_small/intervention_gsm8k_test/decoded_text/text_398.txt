Q: Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Nancy is cleaning her old woodshed, and she found some creepy creatures: spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs. The question is asking how many bugs she counted in total. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, it says she saw 90 spiders. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, spiders = 90. Let me write that down:

Spiders = 90

Next, it mentions that she saw a number of millipedes equal to one-third as many as spiders. So, millipedes are 1/3 of the number of spiders. Let me calculate that.

Millipedes = (1/3) * Spiders
Millipedes = (1/3) * 90
Millipedes = 30

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 divided by 3 is 30. Okay, so millipedes = 30.

Now, the stink bugs. It says the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Hmm, okay, so stink bugs = 2 * Millipedes - 12.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
Stink bugs = 60 - 12
Stink bugs = 48

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 times 30 is 60, minus 12 is 48. So, stink bugs = 48.

Now, the question is asking for the total number of bugs she counted. So, that would be the sum of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

Total bugs = Spiders + Millipedes + Stink bugs
Total bugs = 90 + 30 + 48

Let me add those up. 90 plus 30 is 120, and 120 plus 48 is 168.

Wait, that seems right. 90 + 30 is 120, and 120 + 48 is 168. So, total bugs = 168.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Spiders: 90, that's given.

Millipedes: 1/3 of 90 is 30, correct.

Stink bugs: 2*30 is 60, minus 12 is 48, correct.

Total bugs: 90 + 30 + 48. 90 + 30 is 120, 120 + 48 is 168. Yeah, that seems right.

So, I think the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168.

**Final Answer**
The total number of bugs Nancy counted is \boxed{168}.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is one-third of the number of spiders:

\[
\text{Millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[
\text{Stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

The total number of bugs is the sum of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[
\text{Total bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is \boxed{168}.
