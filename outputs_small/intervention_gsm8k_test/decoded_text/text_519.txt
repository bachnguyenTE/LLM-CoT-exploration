Q: Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house. If Rob takes 2 hours, how many minutes does Royce take?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time to shingle a house. If Rob takes 2 hours, how many minutes does Royce take? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. That's 120 minutes, right? Because 2 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 120 minutes. So, Rob's time is 120 minutes.

Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, I need to calculate double Rob's time first. Double of 120 minutes is 240 minutes. Then, Royce takes 40 minutes more than that. So, 240 minutes plus 40 minutes is 284 minutes. So, Royce takes 284 minutes to shingle the house.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Rob takes 120 minutes, double that is 240. Then, 40 minutes more than that is 240 + 40 = 284. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using algebra. Let me denote Rob's time as R and Royce's time as Y.

Given that R = 120 minutes.

The problem says Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, in equation form, that would be Y = 2R + 40.

Substituting R = 120, we get Y = 2*120 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
