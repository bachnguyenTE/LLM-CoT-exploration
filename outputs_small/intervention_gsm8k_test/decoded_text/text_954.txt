Q: Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.

Okay, so I have this problem here: Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday. I need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Jonathan has two dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so two dozen would be 24 cups. That part seems straightforward. So, he has 24 measuring cups. Now, he also has measuring spoons, and the number of measuring spoons is 2/3 as many as the measuring cups. So, if he has 24 cups, the number of spoons should be 2/3 of that.

Let me write that down. Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) * number of measuring cups. So, substituting the number of cups, that would be (2/3) * 24. Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 3 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 2 is 16. So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

Now, he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, I need to subtract those 6 from his total number of spoons. So, 16 subtracted from 16? Wait, that seems right. So, 16 measuring spoons minus 6 would be 0. So, he gives away all his measuring spoons.

Wait, that seems right. So, he had 16 measuring spoons, gave away 6, so he has 10 left? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 16 minus 6 is 10. So, he has 10 measuring spoons left.

But, that seems right. So, he started with 24 cups, 16 measuring spoons, so total utensils he had before giving any away would be 24 + 16 = 40 utensils. Then, he gives away 6 measuring spoons, so he gives away 6 utensils, so total remaining would be 40 - 6 = 34.

Wait, that seems right. So, 24 cups, 16 measuring spoons, total 40. After giving away 6 measuring spoons, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left, so total utensils would be 24 cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34.

Wait, that seems right. So, 24 cups and 10 measuring spoons, so 34 total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 34.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

He has two dozen cups, which is 24. He has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups, so 2/3 of 24 is 16. So, 16 measuring spoons. Then, he gives Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left. So, total utensils he has is 24 cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the total number of utensils he has remaining is 34.

Wait, that seems right. So, 34 is the answer.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \boxed{34}.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. The number of measuring spoons is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

He gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the remaining measuring spoons are:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of the remaining cups and measuring spoons:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \boxed{34}.
