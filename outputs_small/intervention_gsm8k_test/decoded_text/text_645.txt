Q: A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?

Okay, so I have this problem here: "A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. How much flour (in kilograms) was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says there's a bag of flour that's divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, each bag is split into 8 parts, each part being 2 kg. Then, the question is asking how much flour was in three bags in total before they were divided into portions. So, essentially, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags, each of which is divided into 8 portions of 2 kg each.

Wait, that seems right. So, each bag is 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag must be 8 times 2 kg, right? Let me calculate that. 8 portions times 2 kg per portion is 16 kg per bag. So, each bag is 16 kg. Then, if there are three bags, the total flour would be 3 times 16 kg. Let me compute that: 3 times 16 is 48. So, 48 kg.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. Each bag is 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, 8 times 2 is 16 kg per bag. Then, three bags would be 3 times 16, which is 48 kg. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the total number of portions? So, each bag is divided into 8 portions, so three bags would have 8 times 3 portions, which is 24 portions. Each portion is 2 kg, so 24 portions times 2 kg is 48 kg. Yeah, same answer.

So, both methods give me 48 kg. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 48 kilograms.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I'm missing anything. The problem says a bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. So, each bag is 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 16 kg. So, three bags would be 48 kg. So, that's the total flour before it was divided into portions.

Wait, that seems right. So, the key here is that each bag is divided into 8 portions, each 2 kg. So, each bag is 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 times 16, which is 48 kg.

Alternatively, if I think about it as 8 portions per bag, each portion is 2 kg, so each bag is 16 kg. So, three bags would be 3 times 16, which is 48 kg.

So, both ways, I get 48 kg. So, that must be the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident that 48 kg is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of flour in three bags is \boxed{48} kilograms.

A bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, each weighing 2 kilograms. To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we first determine the weight of one bag. 

Each bag is divided into 8 portions, so the weight of one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of three bags:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Thus, the total amount of flour in three bags is \boxed{48} kilograms.
