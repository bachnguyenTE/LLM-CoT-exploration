Q: Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethal has $8, how much money is Jimmy having?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, identify the amount of money Ethel has, which is $8.

Next, calculate twice the amount Ethel has by multiplying 8 by 2, resulting in $16.

Then, add $2 to this amount to find out how much Jimmy has: 16 + 2 = $18.

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

**Solution:**

Let's determine how much money Jimmy has based on the given information.

1. **Ethel's Money:**
   - Ethel has **\$8**.

2. **Jimmy's Money:**
   - Jimmy has **\$2 more than twice the money Ethel has.**
   - First, calculate twice the amount Ethel has:
     \[
     2 \times \$8 = \$16
     \]
   - Then, add \$2 to this amount:
     \[
     \$16 + \$2 = \$18
     \]

**Final Answer:**
