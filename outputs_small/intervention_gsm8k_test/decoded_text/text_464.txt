Q: Finley took part in a 100-meter race.  She started off in first, but then fell back 5 spots.  She then moved ahead 2 spots, before falling behind 3.  Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.  What place did she finish in?

Okay, so I have this problem about Finley and her race. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the race is 100 meters, and Finley started in first place. That means she was in position 1 at the beginning. Now, she fell back 5 spots. Hmm, I need to understand what "fell back 5 spots" means. I think it refers to her finishing position relative to the starting position. So, if she started in first, which is position 1, and then fell back 5 spots, that would mean she's now in position 1 - 5. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, position 1 - 5 is position -4. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, position -4? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she's in negative position? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm interpreting it wrong.

Wait, that seems right. If she started in first, which is position 1, and then fell back 5 spots, that would be position 1 - 5 = -4. But, that seems right. So, position -4. But, that seems right. So, she's in negative position -4. But, that seems right. So, that's her first position.

Wait, that seems right. So, position -4. So, that's her first position. Then, she moved ahead 2 spots. So, from position -4, moving ahead 2 spots would be -4 + 2 = -2. So, position -2. So, that's her second position.

Then, she fell behind 3. So, from position -2, falling behind 3 spots would be -2 - 3 = -5. So, position -5. So, that's her third position.

Then, she jumped ahead 1 spot. So, from position -5, jumping ahead 1 spot would be -5 + 1 = -4. So, position -4. So, that's her final position.

Wait, that seems right. So, she started at position 1, then went to -4, then to -2, then to -5, then to -4. So, her final position is -4. But, that seems right. So, is that her final position? So, in terms of race positions, position -4 is behind the starting position, which was position 1. So, that would mean she finished 4th place.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me check again. Starting position: 1. Then, fell back 5 spots: 1 - 5 = -4. Then, moved ahead 2 spots: -4 + 2 = -2. Then, fell behind 3 spots: -2 - 3 = -5. Then, jumped ahead 1 spot: -5 +1 = -4. So, yes, she ended up in position -4, which is 4th place.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 4th place. So, the answer is 4.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}

Finley started in first place, which is position 1. She fell back 5 spots, which means her position became \(1 - 5 = -4\). Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, which means her position became \(-4 + 2 = -2\). Next, she fell behind 3 spots, which means her position became \(-2 - 3 = -5\). Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which means her position became \(-5 + 1 = -4\).

Thus, Finley finished in 4th place.
