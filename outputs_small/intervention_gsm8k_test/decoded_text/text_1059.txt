Q: Imma has 3 cats. She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. How many days will 720 grams of cat food last?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of cat food Imma uses per day. She feeds her 3 cats twice a day, consuming 60 grams each time. So, the daily consumption is 60 grams multiplied by 2, which equals 120 grams per day.

Next, I have 720 grams of cat food available. To find out how many days this will last, I divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption. That is, 720 grams divided by 120 grams per day, resulting in 6 days.

To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cat food consumption:**
   
   - **Number of cats:** 3
   - **Feeding times per day:** 2
   - **Amount of cat food per feeding:** 60 grams

   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = \text{Number of cats} \times \text{Feeding times per day} \times \text{Amount per feeding}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 3 \times 2 \times 60\ \text{grams} = 360\ \text{grams per day}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days 720 grams will last:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Daily consumption}} = \frac{720\ \text{grams}}{360\ \text{grams per day}} = 2\ \text{days}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
