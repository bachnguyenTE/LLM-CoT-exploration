Q: A boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has. How many cards do they have together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many cards the boy's brother has. The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 fewer than that. So, I subtract 3 from 5 to find out the brother's total.

Next, I add the number of cards the boy has to the number his brother has to find the total number of cards they have together.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cards the brother has:**
   
   - The boy has **5** cards.
   - His brother has **3** fewer cards than the boy.
   
   So, the brother's cards = Boy's cards - 3
   \[
   \text{Brother's cards} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cards they have together:**
   
   - Total cards = Boy's cards + Brother's cards
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
