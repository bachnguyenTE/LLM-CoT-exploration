Okay, so I need to figure out how much Greg will spend on buy enough jello for his son's birthday party. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, one box makes 10 cups. But, that seems right. Maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be 10 cups? Because 10 cups seems a lot for a jello box, but, that seems right. So, 1 box = 10 cups.

Greg wants to make small jello cups for 30 kids, and he wants each kid to have 4 cups. So, let me calculate how many cups he needs in total. If there are 30 kids and each kid gets 4 cups, that's 30 times 4. Let me write that down:

Total cups needed = 30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups.

Wait, that seems right. 30 times 4 is 120. So, Greg needs 120 cups of jello.

Now, each box makes 10 cups. So, how many boxes does he need to buy? Well, if one box makes 10 cups, then 120 cups would require 120 divided by 10. Let me calculate that:

Number of boxes needed = 120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes.

So, Greg needs to buy 12 boxes of jello. Each box costs $1.25, so the total cost would be 12 boxes multiplied by $1.25 per box. Let me compute that:

Total cost = 12 boxes * $1.25/box.

Hmm, 12 times 1.25. Let me think. 10 boxes would be $12.50, and 2 boxes would be $2.50, so adding those together: $12.50 + $2.500 = $15.00. Wait, that seems right. 12 times 1.25 is 2.50, so 12 boxes would be 2.50, and 10 boxes would be 12.50, so 12 boxes is 2.50, so 12 boxes is 2.50, so 12 boxes is 2.50, so 12 boxes is 2.50. Wait, that seems right. So, 12 boxes would be 12 * 1.25 = 15.00.

Wait, that seems right. 1.25 times 10 is 12.50, and 1.25 times 2 is 2.50, so 12.50 + 12.50 is 15.00. So, total cost is $15.00.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 12 boxes at $1.25 each. 10 boxes would be 11.25, and 1 box is 1.25, so 11.25 + 1.25 is 2.50, so 12 boxes would be 12.50? Wait, that seems right.
