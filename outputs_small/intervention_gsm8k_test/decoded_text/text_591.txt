Q: Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?

Okay, so I have this problem about four dogs sitting in a line, each with different weights. I need to figure out how much the Mastiff weighs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are four dogs: an Affenpinscher, a Dachshund, a Papillon, and a Mastiff. They are sitting in a line, so their weights are related in a sequence. Let me list out the information given:

1. The first dog is the Affenpinscher, and it weighs 10 pounds. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So Affenpinscher = 10 pounds.

2. Next to him is a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Okay, so Dachshund is 2 times the weight of the Affenpinscher. Since the Affenpinscher is 10 pounds, the Dachshund must be 10 * 2 = 20 pounds. That makes sense.

3. Next to the Dachshund is a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the weight of the Papillon is (1/4) of the Dachshund's weight. The Dachshund is 20 pounds, so the Papillon is 20 * (1/4) = 5 pounds. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 20 divided by 4 is indeed 5. So, Papillon is 5 pounds.

4. At the end of the line is a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff is 44 times the weight of the Papillon. The Papillon is 5 pounds, so the Mastiff is 5 * 44. Let me calculate that: 5 * 44. Hmm, 5*40 is 200, and 5*4 is 20, so 200 + 20 = 220. So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Affenpinscher: 10 pounds. That's given.

2. Dachshund: twice the Affenpinscher. 10 * 2 = 20 pounds. Correct.

3. Papillon: one-fourth the Dachshund. 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. That's correct.

4. Mastiff: 44 times the Papillon. 5 * 44. Let me compute 5*44. 5*4 is 20, 5*40 is 200, so 200 + 20 = 220. Yep, that's 220 pounds.

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds. Hmm, that seems a bit heavy, but, that seems right. Let me think if I interpreted the ratios correctly.

The Dachshund is twice the Affenpinscher, so that's 2:1. The Papillon is one-fourth the Dachshund, so that's 1:4. So, the order is Affenpinscher (10), Dachshund (20), Papillon (5), and then the Mastiff (220). So, 10, 20, 5, 220. That seems to make sense.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, the weights are increasing, but, that seems right. The Affenpinscher is the lightest, then the Dachshund is heavier, then the Papillon is a bit heavier, and the Mastiff is the heaviest.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So, 10, 20, 5, 220. So,
