Q: Three people divided an amount of $1920. The second took $80 more than the first and the third took twice what the second took. Calculate the share of the first one.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where three people divided $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first, and the third took twice what the second took. I need to find out how much the first person got. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably assign variables to each person's share to make it easier to work with. Let me call the first person's share "x." That seems like a good start. So, the first person took x dollars.

Now, the second person took $80 more than the first. Since I called the first person's share x, the second person must have taken x plus $80. So, the second person's share is x + 80. Wait, that seems right. So, second person: x + 80.

Then, the third person took twice what the second took. Since the second person took x + 80, the third person must have taken 2 times that amount. So, the third person's share is 2*(x + 80). Let me write that down: 2*(x + 80).

Now, the total amount they all took together is $1920. So, if I add up all three shares, it should equal 1920. Let me write that as an equation:

x (first person) + (x + 80) (second person) + 2*(x + 80) (third person) = 1920.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second person's share. The problem says the second took $80 more than the first. So, if the first took x, the second took x + 80. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, let me simplify this equation step by step. First, I'll expand the third person's share:

2*(x + 80) = 2x + 160.

So, now the equation becomes:

x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920.

Let me combine like terms. Let's see, the x terms: x + x + 2x. That's 4x. Then the constants: 80 + 160. That's 240.

So, the equation simplifies to:

4x + 240 = 1920.

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1920 - 240.

Calculating that, 1920 minus 240 is 1680. So, 4x = 1680.

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find x:

x = 1680 / 4.

Calculating that, 1680 divided by 4 is 420. So, x is 420.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First person: 420.

Second person: 420 + 80 = 500.

Third person: 2*500 = 1000.

Now, adding them all up: 420 + 500 + 1000.

420 + 500 is 920, and 920 + 1000 is 1920. That matches the total amount given, so that seems correct.

So, the first person took $420.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake.

1. Let x be the first person's share.

2. Second person's share is x + 80.

3. Third person's share is 2*(x + 80) = 2x + 160.

4. Total is x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920.

5. Combine like terms: x + x + 2x = 4x; 80 + 160 = 240.

6. So, 4x + 240 = 1920.

7. Subtract 240: 4x = 1680.

8. Divide by 4: x = 420.

Yep, that's consistent. So, the first person took $420.

Wait, that seems right. So, the first person got $420, the second got $500, and the third got $1
