Q: Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Wendy and Colin's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these age problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. How old is Colin now?"

Alright, so we have two pieces of information here. The first one is about their current ages, and the second one is about their ages in the future. I need to find Colin's current age.

Let me break it down. Let's assign variables to their current ages to make it easier. Let me say:

Let C = Colin's current age.

Then, since Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, I need to express Wendy's current age in terms of C.

Wait, that seems right. So, in seven years, Colin will be C + 7 years old. Therefore, Wendy is five times that age. So, Wendy's current age would be 5*(C + 7). Let me write that down.

Wendy's current age = 5*(C + 7)

Okay, that's the first equation.

Now, the second piece of information is about their ages in 25 years. It says, "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now." Hmm, okay. So, in 25 years, Colin's age will be C + 25, and that will be equal to a third of Wendy's current age.

So, in equation form, that would be:

C + 25 = (1/3)*Wendy's current age

But, that seems right. So, let me write that as the second equation.

Equation 2: C + 25 = (1/3)*Wendy's current age

But, that seems right. So, now, I have two equations:

1) Wendy's current age = 5*(C +7)

2) C +25 = (1/3)*Wendy's current age

So, now, I can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for C.

Let me write that out.

From equation 1: Wendy's current age = 5*(C +7)

So, equation 2 becomes: C +25 = (1/3)*(5*(C +7))

Let me compute that.

First, compute 5*(C +7): that's 5C +35.

So, equation 2 becomes: C +25 = (1/3)*(5C +35)

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that:

C +25 = (1/3)*(5C +35)

Wait, that seems right. So, let me compute the right-hand side.

(1/3)*(5C +35) = (5C)/3 + 35/3

So, equation 2 is:

C +25 = (5C)/3 + 35/3

Now, let me solve for C.

First, let me get rid of the fractions to make it easier. Let me multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators.

3*(C +25) = 3*(5C/3 +35/3)

Simplify both sides:

Left side: 3C +75

Right side: 5C +35

So, now, equation is:

3C +75 = 5C +35

Now, let's get all the C terms on one side and constants on the other.

Subtract 3C from both sides:

75 = 2C +35

Now, subtract 35 from both sides:

75 -35 = 2C

Which is:

40 = 2C

So, divide both sides by 2:

C = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, let's verify the first statement: Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.

If Colin is 20 now, in 7 years, he'll be 27. So, five times that is 135. So, Wendy is 135 now.

Now, let's check the second statement: In 25 years, Colin will be 20 +25 =45. And Wendy is currently 135, so a third of that is 45. So, 45 equals 45, which is correct.

So, both statements are satisfied. So, Colin is
