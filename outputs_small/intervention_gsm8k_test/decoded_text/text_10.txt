Q: A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a program's downloads over three months. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that in the first month, the program had 60 downloads. That seems straightforward. So, month 1: 60 downloads.

Then, it says that in the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, but, that seems right. So, if the first month was 60, then three times that would be... let me calculate that. 3 times 60 is... 3*60. Hmm, 3*60 is 180. So, month 2: 180 downloads.

Wait, that seems right. So, the second month is triple the first month. So, 60*3=180. Okay, so far so good.

Now, the third month is a bit trickier. It says the number of downloads was reduced by 30% in the third month. Hmm, so that means it's 70% of the previous month's downloads, right? Because if you reduce by 30%, you're left with 100% of the original.

So, let me think. If the second month was 180 downloads, then the third month would be 180 minus 30% of 180. Alternatively, it's 70% of 180. Either way, I can calculate it.

Let me do both to make sure I get the same answer. 

First, 30% of 180. 30% is 0.3, so 0.3*180. Let me compute that. 0.3*180. Hmm, 0.3*100 is 30, 0.3*80 is 24, so 30+24=54. So, 30% of 180 is 54. Therefore, 180 minus 54 is 126. So, 126 downloads in the third month.

Alternatively, 70% of 180. 70% is 0.7, so 0.7*180. 0.7*100 is 70, 0.7*80 is 56, so 70+56=126. So, same result. 126 downloads in the third month.

So, now, to find the total downloads over the three months, I need to add up the downloads from each month.

First month: 60

Second month: 180

Third month: 126

So, total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126.

Let me add them up step by step.

60 + 180 is 240.

240 + 126 is... let's see, 240 + 100 is 340, plus 26 is 366.

So, total downloads over three months is 366.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First month: 60

Second month: 3*60=180

Third month: 180 - 30% of 180=180 -54=126

Total: 60+180+126=366.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 60 + 180 + 126.

60 + 180 is 240, plus 126 is 366.

Same result.

So, I think 366 is the correct total downloads over the three months.

**Final Answer**
The total number of downloads over the three months is \boxed{366}.

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, which means it was 70% of the downloads in the second month. Calculating 70% of 180:

\[ 0.7 \times 180 = 126 \]

Adding up the downloads from all three months:

\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed
