Q: Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two trains leaving San Rafael. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, it says both trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. The question is asking for the distance each train covered in the two days.

Hmm, okay. So, each train is making two trips: one westward for 80 miles and then one northward for 150 miles. I need to figure out the total distance each train has covered over these two days.

Wait, that seems right. So, each train goes west for 80 miles and then north for 150 miles. So, the total distance each train has covered is the sum of these two legs.

Let me write that down. The distance westward is 80 miles, and the distance northward is 150 miles. So, the total distance each train has traveled is 80 + 150.

Let me calculate that. 80 plus 150. Hmm, 80 plus 150. Let me add the tens first: 80 is 80, and 150 is 150. So, 80 + 150. 80 + 150. Wait, that seems right. 80 + 150 is 238. So, each train has covered 238 miles in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, each train went west for 80 miles and then north for 150 miles, so 80 + 150 is 238. So, the total distance is 238 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't misread the numbers. The problem says 80 miles and 150 miles. So, 80 + 150 is 238. Yeah, that's correct.

So, each train has covered 238 miles in total over the two days. So, the answer is 238 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, each train went west for 80 miles, then north for 150 miles, so 80 + 150 is 238. So, yeah, that's the total distance.

I think that's it. So, the distance each train covered is 238 miles.

**Final Answer**
The distance covered by each train in the two days is \boxed{238} miles.

Each train leaves San Rafael at the same time and travels westward for 80 miles and then northward for 150 miles. To find the total distance each train has covered, we add the distances traveled in each direction.

The distance traveled westward is 80 miles, and the distance traveled northward is 150 miles. Therefore, the total distance each train has covered is:

\[
80 + 150 = 238
\]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is \boxed{238} miles.
