Q: Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits her friend Anna who has twice as many silver pesos as he has and 40 more gold pesos. What's the total number of pesos they have together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Alright, so I've got this problem here about Axel and Anna exchanging some pesos. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. He visits his friend Anna, who has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel. The question is asking for the total number of pesos they have together. The answer is labeled as A, but, that seems right. I need to find the total, so I guess I have to add up all the silver and gold pesos that both Axel and Anna have.

Okay, so let's break it down. I think the key here is to figure out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has first, and then add them up with Axel's. That makes sense because the problem is about the total number of each type of peso and then summing them all together.

Alright, so starting with Axel. He has 50 silver and 80 gold. Wait, that seems right. 50 and 80. So, 50 silver and 80 gold. Let me write that down:

Axel's silver = 50
Axel's gold = 80

Now, Anna has twice as many silver as Axel. Hmm, so Anna's silver would be 2 times Axel's silver. Let me calculate that. So, 2 multiplied by 50. Let me do that: 2 * 50 is 100. So, Anna has 100 silver pesos.

Wait, that seems right. Twice 50 is 100. Okay, so Anna's silver is 100.

Then, Anna has 40 more gold than Axel. So, Anna's gold is Axel's gold plus 40. Axel has 80 gold, so 80 + 40 is 128. So, Anna has 128 gold.

Let me write that down:

Anna's silver = 2 * 50 = 100
Anna's gold = 80 + 40 = 128

Alright, so now I have all the numbers. Now, I need find the total number of silver and gold pesos that both Axel and Anna have together.

So, let's add up all the silver pesos first. Axel has 50, and Anna has 100. So, 50 + 100 is 150. So, together, they have 150 silver pesos.

Now, for the gold. Axel has 80, and Anna has 128. So, 80 + 128. Let me add that. 80 + 100 is 180, and then 180 + 28 is 208. Wait, that seems right. 80 + 128 is 208? Wait, that seems right. 80 + 128 is 208. Let me check that again. 80 + 128: 80 + 100 is 180, then 180 + 28 is 208. Yeah, that's correct.

So, together, they have 208 gold pesos.

Now, to find the total number of pesos, I need to add the total silver and total gold together. So, 150 silver + 208 gold. Let me add those. 150 + 200 is 350, and then 350 + 8 is 358. So, 150 + 208 is 358.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my addition. 150 + 208: 100 + 200 is 300, 50 + 8 is 63, so 300 + 63 is 393. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
