Q: A real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a real estate agent who buys newspaper and television ads. Let me try to figure out how much he spent in total. Hmm, the problem says he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. I need to find the total amount he spent on all the ads.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to calculate how much he spent on the newspaper ads separately and then do the same for the television ads. After that, I can add both amounts together to get the total cost. That makes sense because he bought two different types of ads, so their costs should be separate.

Starting with the newspaper ads. He spent $5 on each one, and he bought 50 of them. So, to find the total cost for the newspaper ads, I should multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads. That would be 5 dollars times 50. Let me write that out: 5 * 50. Hmm, 5 times 50. Well, 5 times 5 is 25, and since it's 50, that would be 250. So, he spent $250 on the newspaper ads. Wait, that seems right. 50 times 5 is 250, so yeah, $250.

Now, moving on to the television ads. He spent $75 on each one, and he bought 15 of them. So, similar to the newspaper ads, I need to multiply the cost per ad by the number of ads. That would be 75 * 15. Let me calculate that. 75 times 10 is 75, and 75 times 5 is 375. So, adding those together, 75 + 375 is 450. So, he spent $450 on the television ads.

Now, to find the total amount he spent on all the ads, I need to add the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads together. So, that would be 250 + 450. Let me add those. 250 plus 400 is 650, and then plus 50 is 700. So, the total amount he spent is $700.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the newspaper ads: 5 * 50. 5 times 50 is 250. That's correct. For the television ads: 75 *15. 75 times 10 is 750, and 75 times 5 is 375. Adding those gives 750 + 375 = 1125. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
