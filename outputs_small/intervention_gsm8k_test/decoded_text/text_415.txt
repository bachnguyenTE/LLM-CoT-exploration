Q: While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Joanne and her sister gathering apples. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Hmm, let's see.

First, let me parse the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Her sister gathers half this amount from the shortest trees. So, that would be half of 30, which is 15 apples from the shortest trees.
3. The sister gathers more apples from the average trees. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the sister gathers more apples from average trees than Joanne? Or is it that Joanne gathers 30 from tallest, and her sister gathers half that from shortest, and more from average? Hmm, the problem says: "Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees." So, Joanne gathers 30 from tallest, half (which is 15) from shortest, and more from average. But, that seems right. So, the sister gathers twice as many from tallest and 3 times as many from shortest, and none from average. So, the sister's total is twice the tallest and thrice the shortest, and nothing from average.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me try to structure this.

Let me denote:

- Let J_t be the number of apples Joanne gathers from tallest trees. So, J_t = 30.

- Let S_t be the number of apples her sister gathers from shortest trees. So, S_t = (1/2) * J_t = 15.

- Let S_a be the number of apples her sister gathers from average trees. So, S_a = 2 * J_t = 60.

Wait, that seems right. So, the sister gathers twice as many from tallest and thrice as many from shortest, and none from average.

But, that seems right. So, the total apples gathered by the sister would be S_t + S_a + 0 = 15 + 60 = 75 apples.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total apples from the sisters is 500. So, Joanne's apples plus her sister's apples equal 500.

So, Joanne gathers 30 from tallest, and let me denote J_a as the number of apples she gathers from average trees. So, Joanne's total is 30 + J_a.

Her sister's total is 15 + 60 = 75.

So, the combined total is (30 + J_a) + 75 = 500.

So, 30 + J_a + 75 = 500.

So, 105 + J_a = 500.

Therefore, J_a = 500 - 105 = 385.

Wait, that seems right. So, Joanne gathers 385 apples from the average trees.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

Wait, that seems right. So, Joanne gathers 30 from tallest, 385 from average, and 0 from short? Wait, that seems right. Her sister gathers 15 from short, 60 from average, and 0 from tallest. So, total for sister is 15 + 60 = 75. Joanne's total is 30 + 385 = 415. So, 415 + 75 = 490? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
