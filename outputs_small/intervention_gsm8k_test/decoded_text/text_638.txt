Q: In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the cost per apple by dividing the total cost of four apples by four. Then, calculate the cost of five apples by multiplying the cost per apple by five. Next, find the cost per orange by dividing the total cost of three oranges by three. Finally, determine the cost of five oranges by multiplying the cost per orange by five. Add the total cost of five apples and five oranges to find the final amount Clyde will pay.

**Solution:**

We need to find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges given their individual costs.

1. **Calculate the cost per apple:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for 5 apples:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per orange:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for 5 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$12.0}
\]
