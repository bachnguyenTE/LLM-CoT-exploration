Q: Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how long Milo can make his mosaic with two bags of glass chips. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. Milo is making a mosaic using glass chips. Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 chips. He has two bags, each holding 72 chips. He wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. I need to find out how long the mosaic can be.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by figuring out how many chips Milo has in total. Since each bag has 72 chips and he has two bags, that should be 72 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down:

Total chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

Alright, so he has 144 glass chips in total. Now, each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 chips. So, the area of the mosaic can be calculated by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Area = Total chips / Chips per square inch = 144 / 12.

Let me compute that. 144 divided by 12 is 12. So, the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches.

Wait, that seems right. 12 chips per square inch times 12 square inches would be 144 chips, which matches the total he has. So, the area is 12 square inches.

Now, the mosaic is three inches tall. Since it's a mosaic, I assume it's a rectangle, so the area is length multiplied by height. So, if I know the area and the height, I can find the length.

Area = Length * Height.

We can rearrange this to solve for Length:

Length = Area / Height.

We know the area is 12 square inches and the height is 3 inches. Plugging those in:

Length = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

So, the length of the mosaic can be 4 inches.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Total chips: 72 * 2 = 144 chips. Correct.
2. Area: 144 /12 =12 square inches. Wait, that seems right. 144 divided by 12 is 72, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
