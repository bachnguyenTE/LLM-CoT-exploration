Q: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Eve starts with 20 pomelos. She gives some to her friend, and after that, she has 1/4 of what she originally had. So, I need to find out how many she gave away.

Alright, so let's break it down. She originally had 20 pomelos. If she gives away some, she's left with 1/4 of 20. Let me calculate that first. 1/4 of 20 is... 20 divided by 4, which is 5. So, after giving some away, she has 5 pomelos left.

Wait, that seems right. So, she started with 20, ended with 5. So, how many did she give away? That should be the difference between 20 and 5, right? So, 20 minus 5 is 15. So, she gave away 15 pomelos.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she had 20, gave away 15, she's left with 5. 5 is indeed 1/4 of 20 because 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, that makes sense.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 15. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up an equation. Let me let x be the number of pomelos she gave away. So, she started with 20, gave away x, and is left with 20 - x. According to the problem, 20 - x is equal to 1/4 of 20. So, 20 - x = (1/4)*20.

Calculating the right side, 1/4 of 20 is 5, so 20 - x = 5. Then, solving for x, subtract 5 from both sides: 20 - 5 = x, so x = 15. So, that's the same answer as before.

Hmm, so both methods give me 15. So, that seems consistent. So, I think 15 is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. Let me just think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the problem is saying that after giving some to her friend, she is left with 1/4 of the original, which is 5, so she gave away 15. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that she gave some to her friend and then had 1/4 left, but, that seems right. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5, so she gave away 15.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think 15 is the answer.

But, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

**Final Answer**
Eve gave away \boxed{15} pomelos.

Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some to her friend, she was left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. 

First, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the remaining pomelos from the original amount:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

We can also verify this by setting up an equation. Let \(x\) be the number of pomelos she gave away. Then:
\[
20 - x = 5
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, Eve gave away \(\boxed{15}\) pomelos.
