Q: Belen has two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Belen's pennies. She has two kinds: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and I need to find the combined weight of both pennies. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two pennies: one from 2010 and another from 1959. The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. So, if I let the weight of the 1959 penny be a certain value, the 2010 penny would be three-quarters of that. And since the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains, I can use that to find the weight of the 2010 penny and then add both together.

Let me write this down step by step.

Let’s denote the weight of the 1959 penny as W1959. According to the problem, W1959 = 48 grains.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. So, the weight of the 2010 penny, which I'll denote as W2210, is (3/4) * W1959.

So, substituting the value of W1959, we get:

W2210 = (3/4) * 48 grains.

Let me compute that. 3/4 of 48. Well, 48 divided by 4 is 12, and 12 multiplied by 3 is 36. So, W2210 is 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies, I need to add W1959 and W2210 together.

So, combined weight = W1959 + W2210 = 48 grains + 36 grains.

Adding those together, 48 + 36 is 84. So, the combined weight is 84 grains.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, W1959 is 48 grains. Then, W2210 is three-quarters of that, so 3/4 * 48. 48 divided by 4 is 12, times 3 is 36. So, 36 grains. Then, 48 + 36 is 84. Yeah, that seems correct.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe in fractions or decimals? Let me try that.

Three-quarters is the same as 0.75. So, 0.75 times 48. Let me compute that. 48 times 0.75. Well, 48 times 0.75 is the same as 48 times 3/4, which is 36. So, same result.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of proportions, 3/4 of 48 is 36, as I had before. So, adding 48 and 36 gives 84. So, all methods point to 84 grains.

Wait, that seems right. So, the combined weight is 84 grains.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't misread the problem. It says the 2010 is three-quarters the weight of the 1959. So, 2010 is lighter than 1959. So, 36 is less than 48, which makes sense. So, 36 + 48 is 84. That seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 84 grains.

**Final Answer**
The combined weight of the two pennies is \boxed{84} grains.

Let \( W_{1959} \) be the weight of the 1959 penny, which is given as 48 grains. The weight of the 2010 penny, \( W_{2210} \), is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
W_{2210} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
W_{2210} = \frac{3}{4} \times
