Q: Marilyn wants to buy a pair of boots online. On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at what's happening on Amazon. The boots cost $16 each, and the shipping cost is $4. So, the total cost for the boots on Amazon would be the price of the boots plus the shipping. That would be $16 + $4, which is $10. Wait, that seems right. $16 plus $4 is $10. So, on Amazon, the total cost is $10.

Now, moving on to eBay. The boots are cheaper on the price side, at $13 each, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the boots on eBay are $13 each. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the price on eBay is $13. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon. On Amazon, shipping is $4, so twice that would be $8. So, shipping on eBay is $8.

Therefore, the total cost on eBay would be the price of the boots plus the shipping. So, that's $13 + $8. Let me calculate that. $13 plus $8 is $21. So, the total cost on eBay is $21.

Wait, that seems right. So, on Amazon, the total cost is $10, and on eBay, it's $21. So, the question is asking how much more expensive the boots work out to be on eBay compared to Amazon. So, I need to find the difference between the two totals.

So, subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay. That would be $21 minus $10. Let me do that subtraction. $21 minus $10 is $11. So, the difference is $11.

Wait, that seems right. So, the boots are $11 more expensive on eBay than on Amazon. So, the answer is $11.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

On Amazon: $16 boots + $4 shipping = $20 total. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
