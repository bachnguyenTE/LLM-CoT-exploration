Q: John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his speed talking. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John normally speaks at 150 WPM. Hmm, WPM stands for words per minute, right? So that's his speaking speed without any training. Then, after training, his speed becomes 2.5 times faster. I need to find out how long it would take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words. 

Alright, let me break this down. I think I need to calculate his new speaking speed after training and then figure out how long it takes him to transcribe 10 pages at that speed. 

Starting with his original speed: 150 WPM. Wait, that seems right. 150 words per minute. Then, after training, he's 2.5 times faster. So, I need to multiply his original speed by 2.5 to get his new speed. 

Let me write that down: New speed = 150 WPM * 2.5. Hmm, 150 times 2.5. Let me calculate that. 150 * 2 is 300, and 150 * 0.5 is 75, so adding those together, 300 + 75 is 375. So, his new speed is 375 WPM. That seems pretty fast! 

Now, each page has 450 words. He needs to speak 10 pages. So, first, I should find out the total number of words he needs to speak. That would be 10 pages * 450 words per page. Let me compute that: 10 * 450. 10 times 400 is 400, and 11 times 50 is 50, so 400 + 50 is 450. So, 10 pages equal 450 words. Wait, that seems right. 10 * 450 is indeed 4500 words? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10 pages, each with 450 words, so 10*450 is 4500 words. Wait, that seems right. 4500 words. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he needs to speak 4500 words. His speaking speed is 375 WPM, which is 375 words per minute. So, to find out how long it takes him, I need to divide the total number of words by his speaking speed. 

So, time = total words / speaking speed. That would be 4500 words / 375 WPM. Let me compute that. 

First, let me see if I can simplify this division. Both numbers are divisible by 75, I think. Let me check: 4500 divided by 75 is 60, because 75*60 is 4500. Similarly, 375 divided by 75 is 5, because 75*5 is 375. So, 4500 / 375 is the same as 60 / 5, which is 12. So, 12 minutes. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 375 times 12 is 4500. 375*10 is 3750, and 375*2 is 750, so 3750 + 750 is 4500. Yes, that's correct. So, 12 minutes. 

So, putting it all together: John's original speed is 150 WPM, after training it's 2.5 times that, which is 375 WPM. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages is 4500 words. Dividing 4500 by 375 gives 12 minutes. 

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages after training. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if I missed anything. The problem says "spoke 10 pages," each with 450 words. So, 10*450 is 4500. His speed is 375 WPM, so 4500 / 375 is 12. Yeah, that seems correct. 

I don't think I made any calculation errors. 150*2.5
