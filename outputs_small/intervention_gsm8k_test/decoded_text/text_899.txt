Q: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews. Before Susan could package them, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself. How many cookies will each of Susan’s nephews get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas and she wanted to equally divide them among her 6 nephews. But, that seems right. Let me think about this step by step.

First, Susan has 100 cookies. She wants to split them equally between her 6 nephews. Hmm, so I guess I need to divide 100 by 6. Let me write that down: 100 ÷ 6. Hmm, what's 100 divided by 6? Let me do the division.

6 goes into 10 once, because 6 times 1 is 6. Subtract 6 from 10, and you get 4. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 40. Now, 6 goes into 40 six times because 6 times 6 is 36. Subtract 36 from 40, and you get 4. So, so far, we have 16 with a remainder of 4. So, 100 ÷6 is 16 with a remainder of 4. So, each nephew would get 16 cookies, and there would be 4 cookies left over.

But, that seems right. So, Susan's nephews would each get 16 cookies, and there would be 4 cookies remaining. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, Susan's nephews would each get 16 cookies, and 4 cookies would be left.
