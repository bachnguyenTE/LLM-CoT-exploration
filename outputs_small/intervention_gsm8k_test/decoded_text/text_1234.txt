Q: Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: "Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number is 3/4 of the number she wrote this year. So, I need to find out how many novels she wrote this year. 

Alright, so if 9 is 3/4 of this year's total, I can set up an equation. Let me denote the number of novels she wrote this year as x. So, according to the problem, 3/4 of x is equal to 9. In equation form, that would be:

(3/4) * x = 9

Now, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. That way, I can isolate x on one side. Let me write that out:

x = 9 * (4/3)

Hmm, let me compute that. 9 multiplied by 4 is 36, and then divided by 3 is 12. So, x equals 12. That means she wrote 12 novels this year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she wrote 12 novels this year, then 3/4 of 12 is indeed 9. Because 12 divided by 4 is 3, and 3 times 3 is 9. Yep, that checks out.

Alternatively, I can think about it in another way. If 9 is 3/4, then 1/4 would be 9 divided by 3, which is 3. So, each quarter is 3 novels. Therefore, the total number of novels she wrote this year is 4 quarters, which is 4 times 3, which is 12. That also gives me the same answer, so that seems consistent.

I guess another way to approach it is by using fractions. If 9 is 3/4, then the whole number, which is what we're looking for, would be 9 divided by 3/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 9 divided by 3/4 is 9 multiplied by 4/3, which again is 12. So, that's another confirmation.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was setting up the equation correctly. Since 9 is 3/4 of the total, I set up the equation (3/4)x = 9 and solved for x. Then, verifying by plugging back in or using different methods all led me to the same answer, 12. So, I feel confident that 12 is the correct number of novels she wrote this year.

Just to recap, the steps were:
1. Understand the relationship between last year's and this year's novels.
2. Set up the equation where 3/4 of this year's novels equals last year's count.
3. Solve for this year's total by multiplying both sides by 4/3.
4. Verify the answer using alternative methods to ensure accuracy.

I think that's all there is to it. It wasn't too complicated once I broke it down step by step. Sometimes, these word problems can be tricky, but, that seems right. I don't see any other factors or complexities here. It's a straightforward proportion problem.

Another thing I could consider is whether the problem is asking for something else, but, that seems right. It specifically says, "how many novels has she written this year?" So, 12 is the answer. I don't think I need to consider anything else unless the problem is misinterpreted, but, that seems right. So, yeah, I think 12 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Regina has written \boxed{12} novels this year.

Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year. To find out how many novels she has written this year, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times x = 9
\]

where \( x \) is the number of novels she wrote this year. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Calculating this, we get:

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of novels
