Q: Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles in her pantry. Each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes. Mary wants to bake enough cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles. If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, how many pans worth of cupcakes should she bake?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total number of sprinkles Mary has by multiplying the number of jars by the number of cupcakes each jar can decorate.

Next, calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can bake by dividing the total sprinkles by the number of sprinkles needed per cupcake.

Then, find out how many full pans Mary can fill by dividing the total cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold.

Finally, round up to the nearest whole number since Mary needs to use up all the sprinkles, even if it means an extra pan.

**Solution:**

Mary has **6 jars** of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate **8 cupcakes**. To find the total number of cupcakes she can decorate, multiply the number of jars by the number of cupcakes per jar:

\[
6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

Each pan can hold **12 cupcakes**. To determine how many full pans Mary needs, divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 4 \text{ pans}
\]

Since Mary needs to use up all the sprinkles, she needs **4 pans** worth of cupcakes.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
