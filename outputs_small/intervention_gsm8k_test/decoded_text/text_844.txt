Q: Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as jack. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Peter and Jack with socks and dishes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit confusing, but, that seems right. Let me read it again.

"Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as Jack. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If Jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?"

Alright, so let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how many socks and dishes each person has, and then add them all up. But, that seems right. Let me see.

First, let's note down the information given:

1. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
2. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.
3. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.
4. Jack collected 60 dishes.

So, we know Jack collected 60 dishes. Let me write that down.

Jack's dishes = 60.

Now, from point 3, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. Hmm, so that means Jack's dishes are twice his socks. So, if Jack's dishes are 60, then his socks must be half of that, right? Because twice as many socks as... wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me think.

Wait, that seems right. If Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then:

Dishes = 2 * Socks.

So, if Jack's dishes are 60, then:

60 = 2 * Socks.

So, socks = 60 / 2 = 30.

So, Jack has 30 socks.

Wait, that seems right. So, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.

Now, moving on to Peter. From point 1, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter's socks = 2 * Jack's socks.

Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.

Okay, so Peter has 60 socks.

From point 2, Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter's dishes = (1/2) * Jack's dishes.

Jack has 60 dishes, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

So, Peter has 30 dishes.

So, let me summarize:

Jack:
- Socks: 30
- Dishes: 60

Peter:
- Socks: 60
- Dishes: 30

Now, the question is asking for the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

So, that would be the sum of all their socks and all their dishes.

So, let's add them up.

Total socks = Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90

Total dishes = Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90

So, total socks and dishes together = 90 + 90 = 180.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes. So, adding all socks: 30 + 60 = 90. Adding all dishes: 60 + 30 = 90. Total: 90 + 90 = 180.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Starting from Jack's side: he collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if he has 60 dishes, socks must be 30. That's correct.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so 60 socks. Correct.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so 30 dishes. Correct.

Total socks: 30 + 60 = 90. Total dishes: 60 +30=90. Total together: 180.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 180.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent this with variables.

Let me denote:

Let J_s = Jack's socks

J_d = Jack's dishes

P_s = Peter's socks

P_d = Peter's dishes

Given:

1. P_s = 2 * J_s

2. P_d = (1/2) * J_d

3. J_d = 2 * J
