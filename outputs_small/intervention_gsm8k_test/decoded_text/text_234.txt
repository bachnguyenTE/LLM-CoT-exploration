A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Steve is starting to grow his own tomatoes instead of buying from a store. He wants to eat twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes a day. Hmm, I need to figure out how many tomatoes he eats in a week because the question mentions that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. So, I guess I need to calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week and then determine how many vines he needs to produce that amount.

First, let me break down the information given. Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, his girlfriend must eat half of that, right? Because he eats twice as much as her. So, if Steve eats 6 per day, his girlfriend eats 3 per day.

So, Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes a day. So, together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. But, that seems right. So, if they eat 9 tomatoes a day, then in a week, which is 7 days, they would eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes a week.

Wait, that seems right. So, 9 tomatoes a day times 7 days is 63 tomatoes a week. So, Steve needs to grow 63 tomatoes a week.

Now, the question is, how many vines does he need if each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week? So, each vine gives 3 tomatoes in a week. So, to find out how many vines he needs, we can divide the total number of tomatoes he needs by the number of tomatoes each vine produces.

So, 63 tomatoes divided by 3 tomatoes per vine. Let me do that division: 63 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 6 twice, so 2, then 3 goes into 3 once, so 21. So, 21. So, 21 vines.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 times 21 is 63, so that's correct. So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce 63 tomatoes a week.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. So, Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. If Steve eats 6 per day, his girlfriend eats 3 per day. So, together, 9 per day. 9 times 7 is 63. Each vine gives 3 per week, so 63 divided by 3 is 21. So, 21 vines. Wait, that seems right. So, 21 vines.

Wait, that seems right. So, 21 vines. So, the answer is 21.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce 63 tomatoes a week.

Wait, that seems right. So, yeah, 21 is the answer.

**Final Answer**
Steve needs \boxed{21} vines.

Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. If Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 9 tomatoes a day. Over a week (7 days), they eat:

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/ vine}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Thus, Steve needs \boxed{21} vines.
