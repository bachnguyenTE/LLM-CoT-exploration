Q: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon.  She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Grandma Jones baking apple pies for a fireman's luncheon. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says she baked 5 apple pies. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, I think I need to find out how many pieces of pie there were in total before anyone took them. Since each pie is cut into 8 pieces, and there are 5 pies, I can multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie. That should give me the total number of pie pieces.

So, 5 pies multiplied by 8 pieces per pie. Let me write that down: 5 * 8. Hmm, 5 times 8 is 40. So, there were 40 pieces of pie in total before the guests started eating.

Then, the problem says that after the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. So, that means that some pieces were taken by the guests. I need to find out how many pieces were taken. 

To find out how many pieces were taken, I can subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. So, that would be 40 total pieces minus 14 remaining pieces. Let me do that subtraction: 40 - 14. 

Hmm, 40 minus 10 is 49, and then minus another 4 is 45. Wait, that seems right. So, 40 minus 14 is 30? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 more is 29. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
