Q: Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Okay, so Elly has a bunch of books and she wants to organize them on new bookcases. Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books. Hmm, so there are two middle shelves. Then, the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since a middle shelf holds 10, twice that would be 20 books. Got that. And the top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. So if the bottom holds 20, subtract 5, that would be 15 books on the top shelf. 

Let me write that down to make sure I got it right. Middle shelves: 2 shelves, each holding 10 books. Bottom shelf: twice as much as a middle shelf, so 2*10=20. Top shelf: 5 fewer than the bottom, so 20-5=15. Wait, that seems right. So bottom is 20, top is 15, and middle shelves are 10 each. 

Now, let me calculate the total number of books all the shelves can hold. So, middle shelves: 2 shelves * 10 books each = 20 books. Bottom shelf: 20 books. Top shelf: 15 books. So total capacity is 22 + 20 + 15. Let me add that up. 22 + 20 is 42, and 42 +15 is 57. Wait, that seems right. So total capacity is 57 books. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
