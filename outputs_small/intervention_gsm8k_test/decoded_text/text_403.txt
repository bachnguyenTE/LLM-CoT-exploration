Q: Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mel using an air conditioner. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. That means each hour, it uses 900 watts. So, if he uses it for 8 hours, the total energy used in a day would be 900 watts multiplied by 8 hours. Let me write that down:

Energy per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watts-hour.

Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, each day, he uses 7200 watts-hour of energy. But, that seems right. Now, the question is asking how many kilowatts of electric energy he will save if he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day over 30 days.

So, first, let me figure out how much he would save each day by reducing the time. He used to use it for 8 hours a day, and if he reduces it by 5 hours, that means he'll use it for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.

So, the energy saved each day would be the difference between the original energy usage and the reduced energy usage. Let me calculate that.

Original energy per day: 7200 watts-hour
Reduced energy per day: 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watts-hour

So, energy saved each day = 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts-hour.

Wait, that seems right. So, he saves 4500 watts-hour each day. But, that seems right. Now, the question is asking for the total energy saved over 30 days. So, I need to multiply the daily saving by 30.

Total energy saved = 4500 watts-hour * 30 days = 135000 watts-hour.
