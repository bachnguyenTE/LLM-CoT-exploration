Q: Benny threw bologna at his balloons.  He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw two pieces at each red balloon and three pieces at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna he used was 58 pieces. There were 20 balloons in total, some red and some yellow. I need to find out how many of those 20 balloons were yellow.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let's figure out how many red and yellow balloons there are. We know that there are 20 balloons in total, and some are red, some are yellow. Let me denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. So, R + Y = 20. That seems straightforward.

Now, each red balloon gets two pieces of bologna, and each yellow balloon gets three pieces. The total bologna used is 58 pieces. So, the total bologna from red balloons would be 2 times R, and from yellow balloons, it's 3 times Y. So, 2R + 3Y = 58.

So, now I have two equations:

1. R + Y = 20
2. 2R + 3Y = 58

I need to solve this system of equations to find Y, the number of yellow balloons.

Let me think about how to solve this. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here. From the first equation, I can express R in terms of Y. So, R = 20 - Y.

Then, substitute R into the second equation. So, 2*(20 - Y) + 3Y = 58.

Let me compute that step by step. 2*(20 - Y) is 40 - 2Y. Then, adding 3Y gives 40 - 2Y + 3Y, which simplifies to 40 + Y.

So, 40 + Y = 58. Wait, that seems right. So, 40 + Y = 58. Then, subtract 40 from both sides: Y = 58 - 40, which is Y = 18.

Wait, that seems right. So, Y is 18. So, there are 18 yellow balloons.

Let me double-check my work. If there are 18 yellow balloons, then the number of red balloons is 20 - 18 = 2. So, R = 2.

Then, total bologna from red balloons is 2*2 = 4, and from yellow balloons is 3*18 = 54. 4 + 54 = 58, which matches the total given. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the number of yellow balloons is 18.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 2 red balloons each get 2 pieces, so 2*2=4. 18 yellow balloons each get 3 pieces, so 18*3=24. 4+24=28? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 4+24=28? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
