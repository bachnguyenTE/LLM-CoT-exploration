Q: Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?

Okay, so Mark is trying to choose between two venues for his wife's surprise party. He wants to know how many guests are needed for both venues to cost the same. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let's break down the costs for each venue.

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, no matter how many guests come. That seems straightforward. So, if Mark has, say, 10 guests, he just pays $200. It doesn't matter if 10, 20, or 30 guests come; the cost is always $200.

The second venue is a bit more complicated. It charges $25 per person. But, that seems right. So, if there are 10 guests, it's $250. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
