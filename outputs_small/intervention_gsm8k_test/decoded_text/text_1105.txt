Okay, so Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck, and she wants to save for a retirement period of 20 years. She currently makes $100,000 per year, and she wants to live with 40% of her current salary. Hmm, let me try to figure out how many more years she needs to work.

First, I need to understand what she's planning to do. She's saving 20% of her income each year, which is $20,000 per year. She wants to save enough over 20 years to cover her expenses during retirement. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me break it down.

Her current salary is $100,000. She wants to live with 40% of that, so her annual living expenses are 40% of $100,000. Let me calculate that. 40% of 100,000 is 0.4 * 100,000. Let me do that multiplication: 0.4 * 100,000. Hmm, 0.4 times 100,000 is 40,000. So, her annual living expenses are $40,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, she's saving 20% of her salary each year, which is $20,000, and she wants to live with 40% of her salary, which is $40,000. So, the difference between her savings and her expenses is her net savings each year. So, $20,000 - $40,000 is negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that seems right. She's saving less than she's spending, so she's going to have a negative balance, which means she needs to work more to make up for it.

Wait, that seems right. So, she's saving 20% of her salary, which is $20,000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, her net savings each year is $20,000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she's saving $20,000 per year, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
