Q: The Kennel house keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. If a German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food and a bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. How many kilograms of dog food will they need in a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a Kennel house that keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms a day. The question is asking how many kilograms of dog food they'll need in a week. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how much each type of dog consumes in a week. Since a week has 7 days, I can multiply the daily consumption by 7 to get the weekly consumption for each dog. 

Starting with the German Shepherds: there are 3 of them, and each eats 5 kg per day. So, for one German Shepherd, in a week, it would be 5 kg multiplied by 7 days. Let me calculate that: 5 times 7 is 35. So, one German Shepherd eats 35 kg a week. Since there are 3 of them, I need to multiply 35 kg by 3. Let me do that: 35 times 3 is 105. Wait, that seems right. So, the German Shepherds together eat 105 kg in a week.

Now, moving on the Bulldogs: there are 2 of them, and each eats 3 kg a day. So, for one Bulldog, in a week, it's 3 kg multiplied by 7 days. That's 21 kg. So, one Bulldog eats 21 kg a week. Since there are 2 of them, I need to multiply 21 kg by 2. Let me calculate that: 21 times 2 is 42. So, the Bulldogs together eat 42 kg in a week.

Now, to find the total dog food needed for the week, I need to add the weekly consumption of the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs together. That would be 105 kg plus 42 kg. Let me add those: 105 plus 42 is 147. So, altogether, they need 147 kg of dog food in a week.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

For the German Shepherds: 3 times 5 is 15, and 15 times 7 is 105. Yep, that's correct. For the Bulldogs: 2 times 3 is 6, and 6 times 7 is 42. Adding those together: 105 plus 42 is indeed 147. Okay, so I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any errors in my calculations. So, the total dog food needed is 147 kilograms per week.

**Final Answer**
The Kennel house will need \boxed{147} kilograms of dog food in a week.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day, and each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms per day. To find the weekly consumption, we first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7.

For the German Shepherds:
- Daily consumption: \(3 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ kg/day}\)
- Weekly consumption: \(21 \text{ kg/day} \times 3 = 63 \text{ kg/week}\)

For the Bulldogs:
- Daily consumption: \(2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ kg/day}\)
- Weekly consumption: \(14 \text{ kg/day} \times 2 = 28 \text{ kg/week}\)

Adding the weekly consumption of both dogs:
- Total weekly consumption: \(63 \text{ kg/week} + 28 \text{ kg/week} = 91 \text{ kg/week}\)

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
- 15 kg/day for 7 days: \(15 \times 7 = 35\)
- Total for German Shepherds: \(35 \times 3 = 105\)

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs: \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
- 6 kg/day for 7 days: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)
- Total for Bulldogs: \(42 \times 2 = 84\)

Adding the weekly consumption of both dogs:
-
