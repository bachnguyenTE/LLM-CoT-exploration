Q: Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?

Okay, so I have this problem about how high Naruto can lift a mountain compared to other people. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can. Hmm, okay. So if I let the height that Kagiyami can lift a mountain be some number, then Naruto's height would be ten times that. But, that seems right. Let me write that down.

Let me assign variables to make it clearer. Let's say:

- Let \( K \) be the height Kagiyami can lift a mountain.
- Then, Naruto's height \( N \) would be \( 10K \) because he can lift ten times higher.

But, that seems right. So, \( N = 10K \).

Next, the problem says that Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay can. So, if I let \( S \) be the height that Saskay can lift a mountain, then \( K = 4S \). So, \( K = 4S \).

So, substituting that into the previous equation, \( N = 10K = 10 \times 4S = 40S \). So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 times higher than Saskay.

But, that seems right. So, \( N = 40S \).

Then, the problem states that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. So, if I let \( P \) be the height Pompei can lift a mountain, then \( S = 12P \). So, \( S = 12P \).

Substituting that into the previous equation, \( N = 40S = 40 \times 12P \). Let me calculate that. 40 times 12 is... 40*10 is 400, 40*2 is 80, so 400 + 80 is 520. So, \( N = 520P \).

But, that seems right. So, \( N = 5220P \).

Wait, that seems right. So, if Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then \( P = 1 \) inch. So, substituting that into the equation, \( N = 520 \times 1 = 520 \) inches.

But, that seems right. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 520 inches. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
