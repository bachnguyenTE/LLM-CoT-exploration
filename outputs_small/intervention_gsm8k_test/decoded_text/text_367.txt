Q: 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?

Okay, so I have this problem here about customers being kicked out of a store for different behaviors. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. That seems straightforward. So, let me note that down. Let me assign a variable to the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Let's say the number of shoplifters is S. 

Then, it says that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Hmm, so that means the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of people kicked out for refusing masks minus 5. Since we already know that 3 people were kicked out for refusing masks, let me plug that in. 

So, S = 4*(number of people for masks) - 5. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, if 3 people were kicked out for refusing masks, then S = 4*3 -5. Let me compute that. 4*3 is 12, minus 5 is 7. So, S, the number of shoplifters, is 7. 

Okay, so 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting. Now, the problem says that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, if S is 7, then the number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3*S. Let me compute that. 3*7 is 21. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 21 people. Hmm, okay, so 21 is 21, which is 21 people. So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence. 

Now, the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. So, we have 3 for refusing masks, 7 for shoplifting, 21 for physical violence, and then the rest were kicked out for other reasons. We need to find how many were kicked out for other reasons. 

So, let me write that down. Total kicked out = 3 (refusing masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) + x (other reasons) = 50. So, x is the number we need to find. 

Let me compute the sum of the known kicks out. 3 + 7 is 10, plus 21 is 31. So, 31 people were kicked out for the first three reasons. Therefore, the remaining number, x, is 50 - 31. Let me compute that. 50 - 31 is 29. So, x is 29. 

Therefore, 29 people were kicked out for other reasons. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Number for masks: 3. Number for shoplifting: 4*3 -5 = 12 -5 =7. Number for physical violence: 3*7=21. Total so far: 3+7+21=31. Total kicked out:50. So, 50-31=29. Yeah, that seems correct. 

So, the answer should be 29. 

But, that seems right. Let me just think if I interpreted the problem correctly. It says "a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting." So, that number is 4*(number for masks) -5. So, if number for masks is 3, then 4*3=12, minus 5 is 7. So, that's correct. 

Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, 3*7=21. So, that's correct. 

Total kicks out:3+7+21=31. So, 50-31=29. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 50-31 is 29? Wait, that seems right. 50-30 is 25, so 55-31 is 24? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems
