Q: Walter is collecting money for charity. First he collects $500 from his neighbors. Then he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well. How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Walter collects money for charity. He starts by collecting $500 from his neighbors. Then, he collects $1500 from a fund he set up online. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Walter is going to tell his friends and family about his neighbors and the online fund, but, that seems right. Then, his friend gives him $200 as well. So, the question is, how much is the lawyer going to contribute?

Hmm, okay. So, let me parse this. Walter has two sources of donations: $500 from neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. His lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, that means the lawyer's contribution is 3 times the total of all the donations from Walter and his friend.

Wait, that seems right. So, first, let's figure out the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund. Then, add the $200 from his friend. Then, the lawyer's contribution is three times that total.

Let me write this down step by step.

1. Donations from neighbors: $500
2. Donations from online fund: $1500
3. Donations from friend: $200

So, total donations from Walter and his friend: 500 + 1500 +200.

Let me compute that. 500 +1500 is 2050, plus 200 is 2250. So, total donations from Walter and his friend are $2250.

Now, the lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the lawyer's contribution is 3 times the total of Walter's and his friend's donations.

So, 3 * 2250.

Let me compute that. 2250 *3. 2000*3 is 6000, 250*3 is 750, so 6000 +750 is 6750.

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6750.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

First, neighbors: 500, online:1500, friend:200. Total: 500 +1500 is 2000, plus 200 is 2200. Wait, that seems right. 500 +1500 is 2000, plus 200 is 2200. Then, the lawyer is 3 times that, so 3*2200 is 6600. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
