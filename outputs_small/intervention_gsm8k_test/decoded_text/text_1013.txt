Okay, so Janet is a waitress, and she makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a downpayment. She works 40 hours a week. I need to figure out how many weeks she needs to work to save that down payment.

First, let me break down the problem. The car costs $10,000. Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of that. So, I need to calculate 22% of $10,000.

Let me write that down: 22% of $10,000. To find 22% of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 22% is 0.22. Therefore, 0.22 multiplied by $10,000.

Let me calculate that. 0.22 * 10,000. Hmm, 0.22 times 10,000. Let me do this step by step. 0.22 * 10,000. Well, 0.22 * 10,000 is the same as 22% of 10,000. So, 22% of 10,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 22% of 10,000. Let me compute that. 10,000 * 0.22. So, 10,000 * 0.22. Let me do 10,000 * 0.2 = 2,000, and 10,000 * 0.02 = 200. So, adding those together, 2,000 + 200 = 2,200. So, 22% of $10,000 is $2,200. So, Janet needs to save $2,200.

Now, she makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total earnings per hour are 10 + 15 = $25 per hour. Wait, that seems right. So, she makes $25 per hour in total.

She works 40 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings are 40 hours * $25 per hour. Wait, that seems right. 40 * 25 is 1,000. So, she makes $1,000 per week.

Wait, that seems right. So, she makes $1,000 each week. She needs to save $2,200. So, how many weeks does she need to work to save $2,200?

So, total amount needed is $2,200. Her weekly earnings are $1,000. So, 2,200 divided by 1,000 is 2.2 weeks. But, that seems right. So, she needs 2.2 weeks to save $2,200.

But, that seems right. So, 2.2 weeks. But, that seems right. So, she needs to work 2.2 weeks. But, that seems right. So, 2.2 weeks is 2 weeks and 1.4 days. But, that seems right. So, she needs to work 2.2 weeks.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 2.2 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Total cost: $10,000. 22% of that is 2,200. She makes $25 per hour. 40 hours a week. So, 400 *25=1,000 per week. 2,200 divided by 1,000 is 2.2 weeks. So, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. So, 2.2 weeks. So, she needs to work 2.2 weeks.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 2.2 weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.2}

Janet wants to save 22% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a downpayment. The total cost of the car is $10,000.
