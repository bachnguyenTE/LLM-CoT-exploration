Q: A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day how many grams of protein does he get per week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, I can calculate the protein per gram by dividing 3 grams by 100 grams, which gives 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Next, I'll multiply the protein per gram by the number of grams John eats each day to find the total protein consumed in a week. So, 0.03 grams per gram multiplied by 200 grams equals 6.6 grams of protein per week.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   
   - **Total protein in 100 grams of mushrooms:** 3 grams
   - **Protein per gram = 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams/gram**

2. **Calculate the protein consumed in a week:**
   
   - **Daily consumption:** 200 grams
   - **Weekly protein = 0.03 grams/gram × 200 grams = 6.6 grams**

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{6.6\ \text{grams}}
