To determine how much the orchard earned from selling apples, follow these steps:

1. **Find the number of bags sold:**
   
   The orchard sells apples in bags of 10. To find the number of bags sold, divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   
   Each bag is sold for \$5. Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings.
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
