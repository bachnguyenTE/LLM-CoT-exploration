Q: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Betty and Sam have a ratio of popsicles, 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles. I need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, the ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's is 5:6. That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. So, if I can figure out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents, I can find out how many each person has individually.

Let me denote Betty's popsicles as 5x and Sam's popsicles as 6x, where x is a common multiplier. That way, the ratio remains 5:6 because 5x:6x simplifies to 5:6. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. So, if I add Betty's and Sam's popsicles together, it should equal 165. So, 5x + 6x = 165. Let me write that down:

5x + 6x = 165

Adding those together, 5x + 6x is 11x. So, 11x = 165. To find x, I can divide both sides by 11.

x = 165 / 11

Hmm, let me calculate that. 111 goes into 165 how many times? 11 times 15 is 165, right? So, x = 15.

Okay, so x is 15. Now, I can find out how many popsicles each person has. Betty has 5x, which is 5*15, and Sam has 6x, which is 6*15.

Let me compute that. 5*15 is 75, and 6*15 is 90. So, Betty has 75 popsicles, and Sam has 90 popsicles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 75 + 90 is 165, which matches the total given. So, that's correct.

Now, the question is asking how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty. So, I need to subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's.

So, 90 - 75 = 15.

Therefore, Sam has 5 more popsicles than Betty.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The ratio is 5:6, so I set Betty's as 5x and Sam's as 6x. Total is 11x, which is 165, so x is 15. Then, Betty has 75, Sam has 90. Difference is 15. That seems solid.

Wait, that seems right. 15 is the difference, but, that seems right. Let me think again: 5:6, so the difference is 1 part. So, 1 part is 15, so difference is 15. Yeah, that's another way to think about it. Since the ratio is 5:6, the difference is 1, so 1 part is 15, so difference is 15. That's a quicker way.

But, that seems right. So, either way, I get the same answer. So, I think that's correct.

So, the answer is 15 popsicles.

**Final Answer**
The number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty is \boxed{15}.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means Betty has 5x popsicles and Sam has 6x popsicles, where x is a common multiplier. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. 

We can set up the equation:
\[ 5x + 6x = 165 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 11x = 165 \]

Solving for x, we divide both sides by 11:
\[ x = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5x = 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

The difference in the number of popsicles they have is:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Thus, the number
