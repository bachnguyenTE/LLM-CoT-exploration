Q: James decides to pick some blueberries.  It cost $20 to go picking and then another $1.5 per pound.  He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.  How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so James is picking blueberries, and I need to figure out how much he saved by picking them himself instead of buying at the store. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how much it cost James to pick blueberries. The problem says it costs $20 to go picking, and then another $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. So, I think I need to calculate the total cost for the blueberries and then add the fixed cost of going picking.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = Cost to go picking + (Cost per pound × Number of pounds)

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = $20 + ($1.5 × 30)

Hmm, let me calculate the cost per pound part first. $1.5 per pound times 30 pounds. I can do this multiplication:

$1.5 × 30. Let me think, 1.5 times 30. Well, 1.5 times 3 is 4.5, so 1.5 times 30 should be 45.00. Wait, that seems right. Because 1.5 times 10 is 15, 1.5 times 20 is 30, so 15 + 30 is 45. So, $45 for the blueberries.

Now, add that to the $20 for going picking:

Total cost = $20 + $45 = $65.

Okay, so James spent $65 on picking blueberries himself.

Now, the question is asking how much he saved compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound. So, I need to figure out how much it would have cost him to buy 30 pounds at the store and then subtract the amount he actually spent to find the savings.

Let me calculate the cost at the store:

Cost at store = Price per pound × Number of pounds

So,

Cost at store = $2.5 × 30

Hmm, 2.5 times 30. Let me think. 2.5 times 10 is 25, so 2.5 times 30 is 75. So, $75.

Wait, that seems right. 2.5 times 30 is 75. So, buying at the store would have cost him $75.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check:

2.5 × 30. 2.5 is the same as 25/10, so 25/10 × 30 = (25 × 30)/10 = 150/10 = 15. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2.5 times 30 is 75. So, yes, $75.

So, the cost at the store is $75, and the cost of picking himself is $65. So, the savings would be the difference between these two amounts.

Savings = Cost at store - Total cost

Savings = $75 - $65 = $10.

So, James saved $10 by picking blueberries himself instead of buying at the store.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Cost to go picking: $20
2. Cost per pound: $1.5
3. Pounds picked: 30
4. Total cost for blueberries: 1.5 × 30 = 45
5. Total cost: 20 + 45 = 65
6. Store price per pound: 2.5
7. Total cost at store: 2.5 × 30 = 75
8. Savings: 75 - 65 = 10

Yes, that all adds up. So, the answer is $10.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the savings are $10.

**Final Answer**
James saved \boxed{10} dollars.

James decided to pick blueberries and spent $20 to go picking plus $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. 

First, calculate the cost for the blueberries:
\[
\text{Cost for blueberries} = 1.5 \times 30 = 45
\]

Add the fixed cost of going picking:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 45 = 65
\]

Next, calculate the cost at the store:
\[
\text{Cost at store} =
