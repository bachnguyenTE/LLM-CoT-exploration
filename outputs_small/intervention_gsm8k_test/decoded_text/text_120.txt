Q: Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. If there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper, how many sheets of paper does he use every month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week. He uses 2 pads of paper each week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. So, I'll multiply 2 by 30 to find the weekly usage.

Next, to find out how many sheets he uses in a month, I'll multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month. Typically, there are 4 weeks in a month, so I'll multiply the weekly sheets by 4.

Finally, I'll calculate the total monthly usage by performing the multiplication.

**Solution:**

Miguel uses **2 pads** of paper per week. Each pad contains **30 sheets** of paper.

1. **Calculate weekly usage:**
   \[
   2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate monthly usage:**
   \[
   60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
