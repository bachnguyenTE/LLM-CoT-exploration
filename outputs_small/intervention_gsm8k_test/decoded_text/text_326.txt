Q: Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?

Okay, so I have this problem here about people getting on a bus. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

Alright, the problem says: Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?

Hmm, let me break this down. So, initially, some people got on the bus at the terminal. Let me call that number something, maybe "x". That seems like a good start because we don't know how many people got on at the terminal.

So, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, if x people were already on the bus, after the first stop, the number of people on the bus would be x + 5. That makes sense.

Then, at the second bus stop, things get a bit more complicated. First, 7 people got down. So, that would mean we subtract 7 from the current number of people on the bus. So, after the first stop, it was x + 5, so after 7 get off, it would be (x + 5) - 7. Then, at the same stop, 8 more people got on. So, we add 8 to that number. So, putting it all together, after the second stop, the number of people on the bus is (x + 5) - 7 + 8.

And the problem says that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 20. So, we can set up an equation here.

So, let me write that out:

After the second stop: (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20

Simplify that equation step by step.

First, let's compute (x + 5) - 7. That would be x + 5 -7, which is x -2.

Then, adding 8 to that, so x -2 +8. That simplifies to x +6.

So, the equation becomes x +6 = 20.

To solve for x, we subtract 6 from both sides:

x +6 -6 = 20 -6

Which simplifies to x =14.

So, that means x is 14. So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with x people at the terminal.

First stop: +5, so x +5.

Second stop: -7, so x +5 -7 = x -2.

Then, +8, so x -2 +8 = x +6.

Set that equal to 20: x +6 =20.

Subtract 6: x=14.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering the total number of people who got on and off.

So, total people heading to the third stop is 20. That means, after the second stop, the bus has 20 people.

So, starting from the terminal, x people got on.

Then, at the first stop, 5 got on, so total on the bus is x +5.

At the second stop, 7 got off, so subtract 7: x +5 -7.

Then, 8 got on, so x +5 -7 +8.

Which is x +6.

Set that equal to 20? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, x +6 =20, so x=14.

Wait, that seems right. So, yeah, 14 people got on at the terminal.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of people who got on minus those who got off.

So, total people on the bus after the second stop is 20.

So, the number of people who got on is x +5 +8, which is x +13.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait
