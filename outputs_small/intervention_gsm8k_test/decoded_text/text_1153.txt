Q: Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. How many did each person get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many seashells Carlos collected. The problem states that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos. So, Carlos collected 27 minus 5, which equals 22 seashells.

Next, I'll find out how many seashells Carrey collected. It's mentioned that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected half of Carlos's seashells, which is 22 divided by 2, resulting in 11 seashells.

Now, I'll calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three. Jim has 27, Carlos has 22, and Carrey has 11. Adding these together gives a total of 60 seashells.

Finally, to find out how many seashells each person gets when they divide them equally, I'll divide the total number of seashells by 3. Dividing 60 by 3 results in 22 seashells per person.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many seashells each person gets.

1. **Determine Carlos's Seashells:**
   
   - Jim collected **27** seashells.
   - Jim's seashells = Carlos's seashells + 5.
   
   Let \( C \) represent Carlos's seashells.
   
   \[
   27 = C + 5
   \]
   
   \[
   C = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]
   
   **Carlos collected 22 seashells.**

2. **Determine Carrey's Seashells:**
   
   - Carlos collected **twice** as many seashells as Carrey.
   
   Let \( K \) represent Carrey's seashells.
   
   \[
   C = 2K
   \]
   
   \[
   22 = 2K
   \]
   
   \[
   K = \frac{22}{2} = 11
   \]
   
   **Carrey collected 11 seashells.**

3. **Calculate the Total Seashells:**
   
   - Jim: 27 seashells
   - Carlos: 22 seashells
   - Carrey: 11 seashells
   
   \[
   \text{Total} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60
   \]
   
4. **Divide the Seashells Equally Among the Three:**
   
   \[
   \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   
   **Each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells.**
