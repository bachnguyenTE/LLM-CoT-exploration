Q: Charlie had 10 stickers. He bought 21 stickers from a store in the mall and got 23 stickers for his birthday. Then Charlie gave 9 of the stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. How many stickers does Charlie have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I'll start by determining the total number of stickers Charlie initially has. He begins with 10 stickers.

Next, he buys 21 stickers from the mall. Adding these to his initial count, he now has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Then, he receives 23 stickers for his birthday. Adding these to his current total, Charlie has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

After that, he gives 9 stickers to his sister. Subtracting these from his total, Charlie has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers left.

Finally, he uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. Subtracting these from his remaining stickers, Charlie has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.
