Q: Hannah has a mental breakdown while studying for finals and starts smashing windows in the high school's parking lot. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Hannah smashing windows. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. Hannah is smashing windows in the high school parking lot, and she smashes a quarter of the students' cars and three-quarters of the teachers' cars. I need to find out how many windows she smashed in total.

Alright, let's break it down. There are two types of cars: students' cars and teachers' cars. For students' cars, there are 64 cars, each with four windows. For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars, each with two windows. So, I need to calculate the number of windows smashed by each group and then add them together.

Starting with the students' cars. If there are 64 cars and each has four windows, the total number of windows for students is 64 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down: 64 * 4. Hmm, 60 times 4 is 240, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 60*4 is 240. So, 240 windows in total for students' cars.

Now, Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows. A quarter is 1/4, so I need to calculate 1/4 of 240. To do that, I can divide 240 by 4. Let me do that: 240 divided by 4. Hmm, 4 goes into 24 six times, and 4 goes into 0 zero times. So, 60. So, 240 divided by 4 is 60. So, Hannah smashed 60 windows from the students' cars.

Okay, moving on to the teachers' cars. There are 32 cars, each with two windows. So, the total number of windows for teachers is 32 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that: 32 * 2 is 64. So, 64 windows in total for teachers' cars.

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows. Three-quarters is 3/4, so I need to calculate 3/4 of 64. To do that, I can multiply 64 by 3 and then divide by 4. Let me try that: 64 * 3 is 192, and then 192 divided by 4. Wait, that seems right. 192 divided by 4 is 48. So, 64 windows multiplied by 3/4 is 48. So, Hannah smashed 48 windows from the teachers' cars.

Now, to find the total number of windows she smashed, I need to add the windows from students and teachers together. So, 60 windows from students plus 48 windows from teachers. Let me add those: 60 + 48 is 108. So, in total, Hannah smashed 108 windows.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the students' cars: 64 cars * 4 windows = 240 windows. A quarter of that is 240 /4 = 60. That seems correct. For the teachers' cars: 32 cars * 2 windows = 64 windows. Three-quarters of that is 64 * 3/4 = 48. Adding 60 and 48 gives 108. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the answer is 108 windows.

**Final Answer**
Hannah smashed a total of \boxed{108} windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars and three-quarters of the teachers' cars. 

First, we calculate the number of windows smashed by the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Total windows for students' cars: \(64 \times 4 = 240\)
- A quarter of these windows: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60\)

Next, we calculate the number of windows smashed by the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Total windows for teachers' cars: \(32 \times 2 = 64\)
- Three-quarters of these windows: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\)

Adding the windows smashed by both students and teachers:
- Total windows smashed: \(60 + 48 = 108\)

Thus, the total
