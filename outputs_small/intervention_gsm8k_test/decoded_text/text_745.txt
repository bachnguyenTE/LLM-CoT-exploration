Q: Mark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He buys 3 packs for $1800 each.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  How much money profit did he make?

Okay, so Mark is buying old magic cards and selling them. I need to figure out how much profit he made. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards. Each pack costs $1800. So, to find the total cost he incurred, I should multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack. That would be 3 times $1800. Let me calculate that:

3 * 1800 = ?

Hmm, 3 times 1000 is 3000, and 3 times 800 is 2400. So adding those together: 3300 + 2400 = 5700. Wait, that seems right. So Mark spent $5700 in total.

Now, he opens these packs and gets some cards to sell. Let me note down the details:

1. He gets 1 card worth $4000.
2. Another card worth $1000.
3. There are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50.

So, first, I need to calculate the total value of the cards he got. That would be the sum of the values of all the cards.

So, the first card is $4000, the second is $1000, and then 30 cards each worth $50. Let me compute each part:

First card: $4000

Second card: $1000

30 cards: 30 * 50 = ?

30 * 50 is 1500.

So, adding all these together: 4000 + 1000 + 1500.

Let me add 4000 and 1000 first: that's 5000.

Then, 5000 + 1500 = 6500.

So, the total value of the cards he sold is $6500.

Wait, that seems right. So he sold the cards for a total of $6500.

Now, to find the profit, I need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Total cost was $5700, and total revenue is $6500.

So, profit = 6500 - 5700.

Let me compute that: 6500 - 5700.

Subtracting 5700 from 6500: 6500 - 5700 = 800.

So, Mark made a profit of $800.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total cost: 3 packs * $1800 each. 3*1800 is 5400, not 5700. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 3*1800 is 2400 per pack? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
