Q: Skyler has 100 hats on his hand with the colors red, blue, and white. Half of the hats are red, 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, and the rest are white. How many white hats does Skyler have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of red hats Skyler has. Since half of the 100 hats are red, that means there are 50 red hats.

Next, I'll calculate the number of blue hats. After accounting for the red hats, there are 100 - 50 = 50 hats left. Three-fifths of these remaining hats are blue, so 3/5 of 55 is 33 blue hats.

Finally, the remaining hats are white. Subtracting the red and blue hats from the total gives 100 -55 -33 =12 white hats.

Let's determine the number of white hats Skyler has step by step.

**Given:**
- Total hats = 100
- Half of the hats are red.
- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats after red are blue.
- The rest are white.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of red hats.**

\[
\text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of remaining hats after red.**

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 55 = 55
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of blue hats.**

\[
\text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 55 = 33
\]

**Step 4: Find the number of white hats.**

\[
\text{White hats} = \text{Remaining hats} - \text{Blue hats} = 55 - 33 = 22
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{22}
\]
