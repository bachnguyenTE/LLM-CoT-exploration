Q: The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this temperature problem here, and I need to figure out what the temperature was in the morning. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?"

Alright, so starting temperature is 2°C. Then it drops by 8°C overnight. Hmm, okay, so that means we subtract 8 from the current temperature. Then, in the morning, it increases by 3°C. So we add 3 to the result after the drop. Let me write this down step by step.

First, initial temperature: 2°C.

Then, it drops 8°C. So, 2°C minus 8°C. Let me calculate that: 2 - 8. Hmm, 2 minus 8 is... negative 6. So, after the drop, the temperature is -6°C.

Then, it increases by 3°C in the morning. So, we take the previous temperature, which is -6°C, and add 3°C to it. So, -6 + 3. Let me compute that: -6 + 3 is... negative 3. So, the temperature in the morning is -3°C.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Starting at 2°C, subtract 8°C: 2 - 8 = -6. Then, add 3°C: -6 + 3 = -3. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. So, the temperature went from 2°C down to -6°C overnight, and then up to -3°C in the morning. So, the final temperature is -3°C.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using absolute values or something? Let me see.

Starting at 2°C, dropping 8°C: so, 2 - 8 = -6. Then, increasing 3°C: -6 + 3 = -3. Yeah, same result.

Alternatively, I can think of it as net change. The total change is a drop of 8°C and an increase of 3°C. So, net change is -8 + 3 = -5°C. So, starting from 2°C, adding a net change of -5°C: 2 + (-5) = -3°C. Yep, same answer.

So, all methods point to the same result: -3°C.

Wait, that seems right. Let me visualize it on a number line. Starting at 2, moving 8 units to the left (since it's a drop), which brings me to -6. Then, moving 3 units to the right (since it's an increase), which brings me to -3. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of temperature scales, Celsius is a scale where 0 is the freezing point, and negative numbers are below freezing. So, starting at 2, which is above freezing, then dropping to -6, which is below freezing, and then rising back up to -3, which is still below freezing but, that seems right. So, -3°C is a pretty cold temperature, but, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

Is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.

"The temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight and then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. What was the temperature, in degrees Celsius, in the morning?"

No, that's exactly what it says. So, starting at 2, subtract 8, add 3. So, 2 -8 +3 = -3. So, yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is -3°C.

But, that seems right. So, I think I'm confident with that.

**Final Answer**
The temperature in the morning was \boxed{-3} degrees Celsius.

The initial temperature is 2 degrees Celsius. It drops by 8 degrees Celsius overnight, and then increases by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

1. Starting temperature: \(2^\circ\)C.
2. After dropping 8 degrees: \(2 - 8 = -6^\circ\)C.
3. After increasing 3 degrees: \(-6 + 3 = -3^\circ\)C.

Thus, the temperature in the morning was \(\boxed{-3}\) degrees Celsius.
