Q: Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?

Okay, so I have this problem about Lillian's garden and bird feeders. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders, so she decides to build 3 and buys 3 more. So, in total, she has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders. Each of these feeders seems to attract 20 birds throughout the day. But, that seems right. Then, she notices that the birds prefer the feeders she made herself, which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Hmm, so the store-bought ones attract 20 birds, and the ones she made attract 20 + 10 = 32 birds each.

Wait, that seems right. So, each of her own-made bird feeders attract 32 birds, and the store-bought ones attract 20. But, that seems right. So, the total number of birds in her garden each day would be the sum of the birds attracted by both types of feeders.

But, that seems right. So, she has 3 store-bought feeders and 3 made ones. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, so 3 of them would attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds. Each made feeder attracts 32 birds, so 3 of them would attract 3 * 32 = 96 birds. So, total birds would be 60 + 96 = 156 birds.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 store-bought feeders: 3 * 20 = 60 birds. 3 made ones: 3 * 32 = 96 birds. Total: 60 + 96 = 156 birds. So, Lillian can expect 156 birds each day.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, 3 store-bought: 20 each, so 3*20=60. 3 made: 32 each, so 3*32=96. 60+96=156. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 156? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
