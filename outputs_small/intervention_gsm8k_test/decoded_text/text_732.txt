Q: Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. If Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, and Dora is 15 years old, calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Dora, her father, and her mother's ages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says, "Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age." Hmm, okay. So, if I let Dora's age be a variable, maybe I can write an equation for that. Let me denote Dora's age as D. So, Dora is 15 years old, as given. 

So, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. That translates to: Father's age = 2 * D + 8. Since Dora is 15, that would be 2*15 + 8. Let me calculate that. 2*15 is 30, plus 8 is 38. So, Dora's father is 38 years old. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Dora is 15, twice that is 30, plus 8 is 38. Yeah, that makes sense. So, father is 38.

Next, the problem says, "Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father." So, mother's age is father's age minus 4. Since the father is 38, the mother is 38 - 4. Let me compute that. 38 minus 4 is 34. So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, the question is asking for the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. So, I need to add up all three ages: Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age.

So, Dora is 15, father is 38, mother is 34. Let me add them up. 15 + 38 +34. Hmm, let me do this step by step. 15 + 38 is 53, and then 53 +34 is 87. So, the total combined age is 87 years.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Dora is 15. Father's age is twice that plus 8. So, 2*15 is 30, plus 8 is 38. That's correct. Mother is four years younger than the father, so 38 -4 is 34. Then, adding all three: 15 +38 is 53, plus 34 is 87. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the total combined age is 87.

**Final Answer**
The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \boxed{87}.

Dora's age is given as 15 years. 

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. This can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. This can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[
15 + 38 + 34 = 15 + 38 + 34 = 53 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \boxed{87}.
