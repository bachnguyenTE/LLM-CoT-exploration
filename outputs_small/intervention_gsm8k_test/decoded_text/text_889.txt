Q: Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.  If the orchids have 5 petals and daisies have 10 petals, how many more petals do the daisies have compared to the orchids?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of petals on the orchids and the daisies.

There are 5 orchids, each with 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 multiplied by 5, which equals 25 petals.

Next, there are 4 African daisies, each with 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 multiplied by 10, which equals 40 petals.

Finally, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, I subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals: 40 minus 25 equals 15.

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the total number of petals on the orchids and the daisies.

1. **Orchids:**
   - Number of orchids: 5
   - Petals per orchid: 5
   - **Total petals on orchids:** \( 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \)

2. **African Daisies:**
   - Number of daisies: 4
   - Petals per daisy: 10
   - **Total petals on daisies:** \( 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \)

3. **Difference in petals:**
   - **Total petals on daisies** - **Total petals on orchids** = \( 40 - 25 = 15 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
