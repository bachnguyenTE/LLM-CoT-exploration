Q: A farmer is baling hay in their field. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a farmer baling hay and a truck picking them up. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay. So, that's straightforward. Every hour, the farmer is adding 5 bales to the field. On the other hand, the truck is picking up hay as well. Each hour, the truck picks up 3 bales. So, the truck is bringing in 3 bales every hour. 

Now, both the farmer and the truck are working for a 6-hour day. I need to find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after this 6-hour day. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate how many bales each of them collects in 6 hours and then subtract the total number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales the farmer has baled.

Let me write this down to make it clearer. 

First, the farmer's baling rate is 5 bales per hour. So, over 6 hours, the farmer would have baled:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.

Okay, so the farmer bales 30 bales in 6 hours.

Now, the truck is picking up 3 bales per hour. So, over 6 hours, the truck would have picked up:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.

Got it. So, the truck brings in 18 bales in 6 hours.

Now, to find out how many bales are left in the field, I need to subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales baled by the farmer. That makes sense because the truck is taking away hay from the field.

So, the calculation would be:

30 bales (baled by farmer) - 18 bales (picked up by truck) = 12 bales.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my math. 5 times 6 is 30, and 3 times 6 is 18. Subtracting 18 from 30 gives 12. Wait, that seems right. 30 minus 18 is 12? Wait, that seems right. 30 minus 10 is 30, minus 8 is 22? Wait, that seems right. 30 minus 18 is 12? Wait, that seems right. Hmm, no, wait, that seems right. 30 minus 10 is 20, minus 8 is 12. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 30 minus 18 is 12? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
