Q: Jim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Okay, so Jim is going to go to college to earn some money, right? Let me try to figure out how long it will take him to earn the money needed to pay back his loans and also the money he would have made if he hadn't gone to college. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but, that seems right. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the information given:

- Jim is going to college for 4 years to earn some money.
- He gets $50,0000 in loans per year. So, that's $50,0000 per year. Wait, that seems right. So, each year, he has to pay back $50,000. So, per year, he has to pay $50,000 in loans.
- Before college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,0000 a year. So, $25,000 per year.
- After college, his college degree triples his income. So, if he had a job before, his income would be tripled. So, if he had a job that paid $25,000, now it would be $75,000 per year.

So, the question is asking how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. So, in other words, he needs to earn enough money over the 4 years of college to cover both the loans and the lost income from not working during the time he's in college.

Wait, that seems right. So, he's going to get $50,000 per year in loans, but, that seems right. So, he's going to have to pay that back over 4 years. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, he's going to have to pay back the loans, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the total amount he needs to pay back is 4 years times $50,000 per year, which is $200,000. So, he needs to pay back $200,000 in loans.

But, that seems right. So, he's going to have to pay back $200,000 in loans. But, that seems right. So, that's the first part.

But, that seems right. So, the second part is, how long would it take him to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. So, the money lost from not working while in school would be the amount he would have earned during the 4 years of college if he had continued working.

So, if he had a job that paid him $25,000 a year, and he's going to be in college for 4 years, then he would have earned 4 times $25,000, which is $100,000. So, that's the money he would have earned if he had continued working during college.

But, that seems right. So, so, he needs to earn $200,000 in loans, but, that seems right. So, he needs to earn that $200,000, but, that seems right. So, but, that seems right. So, but, that seems right. So, but, that seems right. So, so, but, that seems right. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
