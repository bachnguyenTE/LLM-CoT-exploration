Q: Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. If sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200, how much money are all her jewels worth?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Hmm, let me see. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. I need to figure out how much money all her jewels are worth. Sapphires are worth $800 each, and rubies are worth $1200 each. 

First, let me break this down. Jenna initially has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for rubies. So, after the trade, how many sapphires does she have left? Well, she started with 8 and traded away 3, so that leaves her with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires. 

Now, she got 2 rubies in exchange for those 3 sapphires. So, her total jewels now consist of 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. 

Next, I need to calculate the total value of these jewels. Sapphires are worth $800 each, so 5 sapphires would be 5 multiplied by $800. Rubies are worth $1200 each, so 2 rubies would be 2 multiplied by $1200. 

Let me compute each part step by step. 

Starting with the sapphires: 5 sapphires * $800/sappire. Hmm, 5 times 800. Let me do that multiplication. 5 * 800 is 4000, right? Because 5*800 is 4000. Wait, that seems right. 5*800 is 4000. So, 5 sapphires are worth $4000.

Now, the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby. That's 2 * 1200. Let me calculate that. 2*1200 is 2400. So, the rubies are worth $2400.

Now, to find the total value, I need to add the value of the sapphires and the rubies together. So, $4000 (from sapphires) plus $2400 (from rubies). Wait, that seems right. 4000 + 2400 is 6400. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

5 sapphires at $800 each: 5*800. 800*5 is 4000. Correct. 

2 rubies at $1200 each: 2*1200. 1200*2 is 2400. Correct. 

Adding them together: 4000 + 2400. 4000 + 2000 is 6000, plus 400 is 6400. So, total value is $6400. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the arithmetic. 

5*800: 800*5. 800*2 is 1600, so 800*5 is 4000. Correct. 

2*1200: 1200*2. 1000*2 is 2000, 200*2 is 400, so 2000+400=2400. Correct. 

Adding 4000 and 2400: 4000 + 2000 is 6000, plus 400 is 6400. Wait, that seems right. 6400. 

Wait, that seems right. 4000 + 2400 is 6400. So, the total is $6400. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $6400. 

But, that seems right. Let me just think again. She started with 8 sapphires, traded 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 5 sapphires and 2 rubies. 

Each sappire is $800, so 5*800 is 4000. Each ruby is $1200, so 2*1200 is 2400. 4000 + 2400 is 64
