Q: A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much the dance studio is expected to earn in a month. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that the studio costs $25 per session to rent. That means every time they have a session, they have to pay $25. Then, for each student attending, they charge $1.50. So, the revenue per student per session is $1.50. 

Right now, the studio has 10 students, and they rent the studio 3 days a week. I need to find the expected earnings in a month. Hmm, I wonder how many days are in a month on the basis of this problem. Maybe it's 30 days? Or is it 3 weeks? Wait, that seems right. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so in a month, which is roughly 4 weeks, that would be 3 days times 4 weeks, which is 12 days. 

So, let me write down the key information:

- Rent per session: $25
- Charge per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4

First, I need to calculate the total number of sessions in a month. Since they rent the studio 3 days a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, that's 3 * 4 = 12 sessions per month.

Now, for each session, the studio has to pay $25. So, the total rental cost per month is 12 sessions * $25/session. Let me compute that: 12 * 25 is 60? Wait, that seems right. 12 times 25 is 300. So, the studio spends $300 each month on renting the studio.

Next, I need calculate the earnings from the students. Each student pays $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students. So, per session, the total revenue is 10 students * $1.50/student. Let me compute that: 10 * 1.50 is 15. So, each session brings in $15.00.

Since there are 12 sessions per week, the weekly earnings would be 15 * 3 = 45. Wait, that seems right. 10 students times $1.50 is $15 per session, times 3 sessions a week is $45 per week.

But, that seems right. So, per week, they make $45. Then, over 4 weeks, that would be 4 * 45 = $180. So, the studio makes $180 in earnings from students in a month.

Now, to find the total earnings, I need to add the earnings from students and the rental cost. So, $180 from students plus $300 from renting the studio. That would be 180 + 300 = 480. So, the total expected earnings are $480 per month.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, number of sessions: 3 days/week * 4 weeks = 12 sessions. Correct.

Cost per session: 12 * 25 = 300. Correct.

Number of students: 10, so per session, 10 * 1.50 = 15. Correct.

Earnings per week: 15 * 3 = 45. Correct.

Earnings per month: 45 * 4 = 180. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 45 * 4 is 180. So, 180 from students.

Total earnings: 180 + 300 = 480. So, $480. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the studio's expected earnings are $480 per month.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $480.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the studio has 10 students, 3 days a week, 4 weeks. So, 12 sessions. Each session, they have to pay $25, so 12 *25=300. Each session, they make 10 *1.50=15, so 15*12=60. So, 300 +60=360. Wait,
