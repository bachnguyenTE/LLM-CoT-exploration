Q: Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?

Okay, so Richard wants to make a video where he puts a branded candy inside a fountain of diet soda in his driveway. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. After starting at the first bottle, it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next. The question is asking how many seconds total it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the driveway is 24 feet wide, and he's placing a bottle every 3 feet. So, I need to figure out how many bottles he'll need. That should be the total width divided by the distance between each bottle. So, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So, he'll need 8 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. 3 feet between each bottle, so starting at 0 feet, then 3 feet, 6 feet, and so on, up to 24 feet. Let me count: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21. Wait, that seems right. 8 bottles in total.

Now, he starts at the first bottle, and it takes him 5 seconds to go from one to the next. So, if he starts at the first bottle, then the next one is 5 seconds later, then the third is another 5 seconds, and so on.

But, that seems right. So, if he has 8 bottles, how many intervals does he have? Let me think. If he starts at the first bottle, then the number of intervals between bottles is one less than the number of bottles. So, 8 bottles would mean 7 intervals.

Wait, that seems right. Because if you have two bottles, there's one interval between them. So, for 8 bottles, it's 7 intervals. So, each interval takes 5 seconds. So, total time is 7 intervals multiplied by 5 seconds per interval.

So, 7 times 5 is 35. So, 35 seconds total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, 8 bottles, 7 gaps between them, each gap takes 5 seconds. So, 7*5=35 seconds.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 35 seconds.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total time is 35 seconds.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \boxed{35} seconds.

Richard wants to create a video where he places a branded candy inside a fountain of diet soda every 3 feet along a 24-foot wide driveway. 

First, we determine the number of bottles needed. Since he places a bottle every 3 feet, we divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of intervals between the bottles. Since he starts at the first bottle, the number of intervals is one less than the number of bottles:
\[
8 \text{ bottles} - 1 = 7 \text{ intervals}
\]

Each interval takes 5 seconds to set off. Therefore, the total time is:
\[
7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \boxed{35} seconds.
