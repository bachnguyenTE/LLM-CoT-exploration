Okay, so I have this problem here about a whiteboard shared between four teachers. Each teacher takes turns using the whiteboard, and they each have two lessons per day. The whiteboard is cleaned three times per lesson. The question is asking how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, there are four teachers, and they take turns using the whiteboard. Each teacher has two lessons per day. So, each teacher uses the whiteboard twice a day. Since there are four teachers, that means the whiteboard is used four times a day, right? Because each teacher uses it once per day, and there are four teachers.

Wait, that seems right. So, each day, the whiteboard is used four times. Now, each time the whiteboard is used, it's in each of the two lessons. So, each usage is in a specific lesson. But, that seems right. So, if the whiteboard is used four times a day, and each time it's cleaned three times, then the total number of cleanings would be 4 times 3, which is 12.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each teacher uses the whiteboard twice a day, so four teachers would use it 4 times a day. Each time the whiteboard is used, it's in a specific lesson, and each lesson requires the whiteboard. So, each usage is a separate cleaning? Or is it that each time the whiteboard is used, it's cleaned three times?

Wait, that seems right. So, if the whiteboard is used four times a day, and each time it's cleaned three times, then the total number of cleanings is 4 times 3, which is 12.

But, that seems right. Let me think about it another way. Each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned three times. Each teacher has two lessons per day, so each teacher uses the whiteboard twice. So, each teacher's two lessons would require the whiteboard to be cleaned three times each time it's used. So, for each teacher, that's 2 times 3 cleanings, which is 6 cleanings per teacher per day.

But, that seems right. So, each teacher uses the whiteboard twice, each time requiring three cleanings, so 6 cleanings per teacher. Since there are four teachers, that would be 4 times 6, which is 24 cleanings.

Wait, that seems right. So, 24 cleanings in a day.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 24.

Wait, that seems right. So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 24.
