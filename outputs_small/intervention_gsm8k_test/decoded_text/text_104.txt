Q: Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, then her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. How many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Poppy is trying to solve a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Hmm, that's a lot! Let me see how to figure out how many pieces are left after she and her mom have placed some. 

First, Poppy starts by placing a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter is like 25%, right? So, if there are 1000 pieces in total, a quarter of that would be... let me calculate that. 

1000 divided by 4. Hmm, 1000 divided by 4 is 250. So, Poppy placed 250 pieces. That seems straightforward. 

Now, after Poppy placed her part, there are still some pieces left. The question says her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. Okay, so I need to figure out how many pieces are left after Poppy's part and then calculate a third of that number. 

So, after Poppy placed 250 pieces, the remaining number of pieces is 1000 minus 250. Let me do that subtraction. 

1000 minus 250. Hmm, 1000 minus 200 is 800, and then minus another 50 is 830. Wait, that seems right. So, there are 830 pieces left after Poppy's placement.

Now, her mom is going to place a third of these remaining pieces. So, I need to find a third of 830. Let me write that down. 

830 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 8 two times with a remainder of 2. Then bring down the 3, making it 23. 3 goes into 23 seven times with a remainder of 2. Then bring down the 0, making it 20. 3 goes into 20 six times with a remainder of 2. So, that gives me 278 with a remainder of 2. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 830 divided by 3 is 278 with a remainder of 2. But, that seems right. So, her mom places 278 pieces, and there's still 2 pieces left. 

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

First, 1000 minus 250 is 750. Wait, that seems right. 1000 minus 250 is 750. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
