Q: A watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?

Okay, so I have this problem about a watermelon farm that produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. She took them home. Then, when she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. The question is asking how many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. The answer choices aren't provided, but, that seems right. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me try to understand the problem. There are 120 watermelons in total. Ashlyn takes 30% of them home the first time. Then, the remaining watermelons are left, and the next time she comes back, 3/4 of them are ready. We need to find out how many are not ready after the second harvest.

So, let me break it down into steps.

1. **First Harvest:**
   - Total watermelons: 120
   - Percentage ready: 30% (which is 0.3 in decimal)
   - Number of watermelons taken home: 120 * 0.3
   - Let me calculate that: 120 * 0.3 = 36. So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons.

2. **Remaining Watermelons After First Harvest:**
   - Total: 120
   - Taken home: 36
   - Remaining: 120 - 36 = 120 - 36 = 84
   - So, 84 watermelons are left.

3. **Second Harvest:**
   - Now, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready.
   - Number taken home: 84 * (3/4)
   - Let me compute that: 84 * 0.75 = 63
   - So, she takes home 63 watermelons the second time.

4. **Remaining Watermelons After Second Harvest:**
   - Total remaining: 84
   - Taken home: 63
   - So, remaining: 84 - 63 = 21
   - Therefore, 21 watermelons are not ready after the second harvest.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 30% of 120 is indeed 36. 120 - 36 is 84. Then, 3/4 of 84 is 63, so 84 - 63 is 21. So, 21 watermelons are not ready.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions. 30% is 3/10, so 3/10 of 120 is 36. Then, 7/10 of 120 is 84. Then, 3/4 of 84 is 63, so 1/4 of 84 is 21. So, 21 watermelons are not ready. That also gives 21.

Wait, that seems right. So, 21 is the number of watermelons not ready after the second harvest.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 21.
