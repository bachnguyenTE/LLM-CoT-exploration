Q: Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age now is 162. I need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios. I remember that ratios compare two quantities. So, if Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, that means for every 7 years Darrell is older than Allen, Allen is 11 years old. Wait, that seems right. So, if I let the common multiple be some number, say, x, then Darrell's age would be 7x and Allen's age would be 11x. That makes sense.

So, Darrell is 7x years old, and Allen is 11x years old. Now, the problem says their total age now is 162. So, if I add their ages together, that should equal 162. Let me write that down:

7x + 11x = 162

Wait, that seems right. So, combining like terms, 7x +11x is 18x. So, 18x = 162. To find x, I can divide both sides by 18.

x = 162 / 18

Let me calculate that. 18 times 9 is 162, so x is 9. Okay, so x is 9. That means Darrell's age is 7x, which is 7*9, and Allen's age is 11x, which is 11*9.

Calculating that, 7*9 is 63, and 11*9 is 99. So, Darrell is 63 years old, and Allen is 99 years old now.

But, that seems right. Let me check: 63 + 99 is 162, which matches the total age given. So, that's correct.

Now, the question is asking for Allen's age 10 years from now. So, I need to add 10 years to Allen's current age.

So, Allen's current age is 99. Adding 10 years: 99 +10 = 109.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10 years from now, Allen will be 109 years old.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

So, starting from the beginning: the ratio is 7:11. So, Darrell is 7 parts, Allen is 11 parts. Total parts are 18. Total age is 162, so each part is 162 divided by 18, which is 20.25.
