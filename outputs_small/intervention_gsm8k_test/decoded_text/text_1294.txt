Q: Jake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Jake spends at the store. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the store has a "buy one get one 50% off" deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Each T-shirt originally costs $8. Then, he buys a pair of shoes that's 40 off the original price, and the shoes originally cost $40. I need to calculate the total amount he spends.

Alright, let's tackle the T-shirts first. The deal is buy one, get one 50% off. So, if he buys two, he gets one at full price and the other at 50% off. Let me calculate the cost for each T-shirt.

The original price is $8. If he gets one at full price, that's $8. The second one is 50% off, so I need to find 50% of $8 and subtract that from $8.

Calculating 50% of $8: 0.55 * 8 = $4.40. So, the discounted price is $8 - $4.40 = $3.60.

So, each T-shirt costs $8 and $3.60. Since he bought two, the total for the T-shirts is $8 + $3.60 = $11.60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 50% off on $8 is $4, so 8 - 4 is $4, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 50% of 8 is 4.4, so 8 - 4.4 is 3.6. So, yeah, $3.60 for the second one. So, total for two T-shirts is $11.60.

Now, moving on to the shoes. The original price is $40, and it's 40% off. So, I need to find 40% of $40 and subtract that from $40.

Calculating 40% of $40: 0.40 * 40 = $16. So, the discounted price is $40 - $16 = $24.

So, the shoes cost $24 after the discount.

Now, to find the total amount Jake spends, I need to add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together.

So, $11.60 (T-shirts) + $24.00 (shoes) = $35.60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them again: 11.6 + 24.00. 11 + 24 is 35, and 0.60 remains, so total is $35.60.

Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

For the T-shirts: 50% off on $8 is $4, so the second one is $4. So, 8 + 4 = $12. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
