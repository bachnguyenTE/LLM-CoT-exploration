Q: The caretaker of the docks needs to buy some new line. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there is 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line. How many feet of line does he need to buy in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much new line the caretaker needs for the new dock. The problem states that he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. 

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of dock space. There are currently 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line.

Then, I'll multiply the total dock space by the required line per foot to find out how much new line is needed in total. 

Finally, I'll subtract the amount of new line he already has from the total required line to find out how many feet of line he needs to purchase.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total length of the dock:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total dock length} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of new line needed:**
   
   The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
   
   \[
   \text{Total new line needed} = 3 \times \text{Total dock length} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Subtract the amount of new line he already has:**
   
   \[
   \text{New line to buy} = \text{Total new line needed} - \text{Current new line} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{594}
\]
