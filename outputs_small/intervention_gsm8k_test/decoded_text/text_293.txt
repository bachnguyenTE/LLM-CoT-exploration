Q: Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. How many points do all three players have in total after the extra points had been distributed?

Okay, so I have this problem where three friends—Mike, Jim, and Tony—are playing a game. They've played four rounds, and I need to figure out their total points after the extra points were given in the fourth round. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the information given:

1. After 3 rounds:
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike.

2. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

I need to find the total points all three players have after the extra points were distributed in the fourth round.

Alright, let's start by figuring out how many points each player has after 3 rounds.

Mike has 21 points. That's straightforward.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike. So, if Mike has 21, Jim must have 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Hmm, "2 times more" can be a bit confusing. Is that 2 times as many as Mike, or 2 times more than Mike? I think it's the latter, meaning 2 times as many as Mike. So, 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Wait, that seems right. So, after 3 rounds:

- Mike: 21
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42

Let me just double-check that. If "2 times more" is 2 times as much, then yes, 21 * 2 = 42. If it were "2 times as many," it would still be 42. So, that seems consistent.

Now, moving on to the fourth round. In this round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, we need to check each player's current points after the third round and see if they have more than 20 points. If they do, they get an extra point in the fourth round.

Let's go through each player:

1. Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds. 21 is more than 20, so he gets an extra point in the fourth round. So, Mike's points after the fourth round will be 21 + 1 = 22.

2. Jim has 18 points after 3 rounds. 18 is more than 20? Wait, that seems right. 18 is less than 20, so he doesn't get an extra point. So, Jim's points remain 18.

3. Tony has 42 points after 3 rounds. 42 is way more than 20, so he also gets an extra point. So, Tony's points after the fourth round will be 42 + 1 = 43.

So, after the fourth round, their points are:

- Mike: 22
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 43

Now, I need to find the total points all three players have after the extra points were distributed.

Let me add them up:

22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = ?

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 22 + 18. 22 + 10 is 32, and 32 +8 is 40.

Then, 40 + 43. 40 + 40 is 80, and 80 +3 is 83.

So, the total points are 83.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just verify each step again.

After the fourth round:

- Mike: 21 +1 =22
- Jim: 18 (no change)
- Tony:42 +1=43

Total:22 +18 +43.

22 +18 is 40, and 40 +43 is 83. Yep, that's correct.

So, the total points after the extra points are distributed is 83.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

After 3 rounds:

- Mike:21
- Jim:18
- Tony:42

In the fourth round:

- Mike:21 +1=22 (since 21>20)
- Jim:18 (no change)
- Tony:42 +1=43 (since 42>20)

Total:22 +18 +43=83.

Yep, that all adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

**Final Answer**
The total points all three
