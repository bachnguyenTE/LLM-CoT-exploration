Q: Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00 while 4 bottles of water cost $8. If David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, how much will that cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the cost per bottle of soda by dividing the total cost of seven bottles by seven.

Next, determine the cost per bottle of water by dividing the total cost of four bottles by four.

Then, calculate the total cost for three bottles of soda by multiplying the cost per soda by three.

Similarly, calculate the total cost for two bottles of water by multiplying the cost per water by two.

Finally, add the total costs of the three bottles of soda and two bottles of water to find the overall cost.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the cost per bottle of soda:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per soda} = \frac{\$21.00}{7 \text{ bottles}} = \$3.00 \text{ per bottle}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per bottle of water:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per water} = \frac{\$8.00}{4 \text{ bottles}} = \$2.00 \text{ per bottle}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   
   \[
   3 \text{ bottles} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bottle} = \$9.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per bottle} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Add the two amounts to find the total cost:**
   
   \[
   \$9.00 + \$4.00 = \$13.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$13.00}
\]
