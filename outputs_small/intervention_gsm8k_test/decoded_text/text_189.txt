Q: Three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. They also went on 2 different rides which costs $33 for each ride. If they agreed to split all the costs evenly, how much did each of them pay?

Okay, so I have this problem here about three friends who went to the fair and spent some money. I need to figure out how much each of them paid if they agreed to split all the costs evenly. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says they spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, three tickets cost $20.25 in total. Then, they also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the food cost is $4.50 less than the ticket cost. That means if the tickets were $20.25, the food would be $20.25 minus $4.50? Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down.

Total cost on tickets: $20.25

Total cost on food: Total tickets cost minus $4.50

So, food cost = $20.25 - $4.50

Let me calculate that. 20.25 minus 4.50. Hmm, 20.25 is the same as 20 dollars and 25 cents, and 4.50 is 4 dollars and 50 cents. So, subtracting 4.50 from 20.25.

Wait, that seems right. So, 20.25 minus 4.50. Let me do the subtraction:

20.25
-4.50
--------
?

Starting from the cents: 25 cents minus 50 cents. Hmm, I can't do that, so I need to borrow a dollar. So, 25 cents becomes 125 cents, and 20 dollars becomes 19 dollars. So, 125 cents minus 50 cents is 75 cents. Then, 19 dollars minus 4 dollars is 15 dollars. So, total is 15.75 dollars.

So, the food cost is $15.75.

Okay, so now, they went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. Wait, that seems right. So, each ride is $33? Wait, that seems right. So, two rides, each costing $33. So, total cost for rides is 2 times 33.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 times 33 is 66. So, total rides cost is $66.

So, now, let me summarize all the costs:

- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66.00

So, total cost is the sum of all these. Let me add them up.

First, add the tickets and food: 20.25 + 15.75.

20.25 + 15.75. Let me add the dollars and cents separately.

20 + 15 = 35

0.25 + 0.75 = 1.00

So, total is 35 + 1.00 = 36.00.

So, tickets and food together cost $36.00.

Then, add the rides: 36.00 + 66.00.

36 + 66 is 102, and 0.00 + 0.00 is 0.00, so total is $102.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, total cost is $102.00.

Now, they agreed to split all the costs evenly. So, three friends, so each person pays 102 divided by 3.

102 divided by 3 is 34.

So, each person pays $34.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, tickets: $20.25

Food: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Rides: 2 rides at $33 each: 2 * 33 = 66

Total: 20.25 + 15.75 +66 = 102

102 divided by 3 is 34.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, each person pays $34.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

First, tickets: 20.25

Food: 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75

Rides: 2 *
