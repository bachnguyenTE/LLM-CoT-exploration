Q: George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

Okay, so George needs to pay for dental work, and he needs 2 implants. Each implant costs $2000. Hmm, let me write that down. So, 2 implants times $2000 each. That should be 2 times 2000. Let me calculate that. 2000 times 2 is 4000. So, the total cost for the implants is $4000.

But, that seems right. Each implant is $2000, so two of them would be $4000. Okay, got that. Now, George also wants a crown on one of the implants. The crown costs an extra $500. So, that's an additional $500. So, I need to add that to the total cost of the implants.

So, $4000 plus $500. Let me add those together. 4000 plus 500 is 4500. So, the total cost for the dental work is $4500.

Wait, that seems right. So, he needs $4500 in total. Now, he has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he's already saved up $600. So, how much more does he need to pay?

Let me subtract the deposit from the total cost. So, $4500 minus $600. Let me do that subtraction. 4500 minus 600. Hmm, 4500 minus 600 is 3840. Wait, that seems right. So, he still needs $3840 more.

Now, he makes $15 per hour at work. So, he needs to figure out how many hours he needs to work to make up the remaining $3840. So, how many hours at $15 per hour does he need to make $3840?

Let me set up the equation. Let h be the number of hours he needs to work. So, 15 times h equals 3840. So, 15h = 3840. To find h, I need to divide both sides by 15. So, h = 3840 divided by 15.

Let me calculate that. 3840 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 goes into 38 two times (15*2=30), subtract 30 from 38, you get 8. Bring down the 4, making it 84. 15 goes into 84 five times (15*5=75). Subtract 75 from 84, you get 9. Bring down the 0, making it 90. 15 goes into 90 exactly 6 times. So, putting it all together, 256.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 times 256 is 3840. Let me check: 15*200=3000, 15*50=750, 15*6=90. So, 3000+750=3750, plus 90 is 3840. Yes, that's correct.

So, George needs to work 256 hours to make up the remaining $3840. So, the answer is 256 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Each implant is $2000, so two of them: 2*2000=4000.
2. Crown is an extra $500, so total cost: 4000+500=4500.
3. Deposit is $600, so remaining amount: 4500-600=3840.
4. He makes $15 per hour, so hours needed: 3840/15=256.

Wait, that seems right. 256 hours. So, yeah, I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, George needs to work 256 hours to cover the dental work.

**Final Answer**
George needs to work \boxed{256} hours.

George needs to pay for dental work, which includes 2 implants and a crown on one of them. Each implant costs $2000, and the crown costs an additional $500. 

1. Calculate the total cost for the implants:
