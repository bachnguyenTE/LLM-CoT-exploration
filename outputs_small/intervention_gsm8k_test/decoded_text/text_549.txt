Q: Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys. How many toys does Jonathan currently have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jonathan and his toys. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had. So, he needed to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys. I need to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

Alright, let me break this down. First, let's parse the information given. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has. So, if I let J be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then he needs J + 2 toys. Got that.

Next, it says this number is five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys. So, James's play set has 80 toys, and Jonathan's play set is five times that. So, Jonathan's play set is 5 * 80. Let me calculate that. 5 times 80 is... 5*80 is 400? Wait, that seems right. 5*80 is 400. So, Jonathan's play set has 400 toys.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, Jonathan needs 400 toys to have five times as many as James's 80 toys. So, Jonathan needs 400 toys.

But, that seems right. So, Jonathan needs 400 toys, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he needs 400 toys, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he needs 400 toys.
