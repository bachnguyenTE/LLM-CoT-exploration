Q: In a family, there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. What is the total age of all these siblings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All the sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the older brother. I need to find the total age of all these siblings. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many brothers there are. The problem says there are 2 brothers. It also mentions that one of the brothers is 12 years old, and that's half the age of the older brother. So, if one brother is 12, the older brother must be twice that age, right? Let me write that down.

If the younger brother is 12, then the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24. So, the older brother is 24 years old. That makes sense because 12 is half of 24.

Now, moving on to the sisters. The problem states that all sisters are the same age, which is 16. It doesn't mention how many sisters there are, but, that seems right. It just says there are 3 sisters. So, each sister is 16 years old.

So, let's list out all the siblings and their ages:

- Younger brother: 12 years old
- Older brother: 24 years old
- Each sister: 16 years old

Since there are 3 sisters, each 16, their total age would be 3 * 16. Let me calculate that: 3 * 16 is 48. So, the sisters add up to 48 years in total.

Now, adding up all the siblings' ages: the younger brother is 12, the older brother is 24, and the sisters add up to 48. So, total age is 12 + 24 + 48.

Let me add 12 and 24 first. 12 + 24 is 36. Then, adding 48 to that: 36 + 48. Hmm, 36 + 48 is 84. So, the total age of all these siblings is 84.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 36. Then, 36 + 48 (sisters) = 84. Yeah, that adds up.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters. So, that's 5 siblings in total. Their ages are 12, 24, and three 16-year-olds. So, adding them up: 12 + 24 is 36, plus 16 is 52, plus another 16 is 68, plus another 16 is 84. Yep, that's consistent.

So, I think 84 is the correct total age.

**Final Answer**
The total age of all these siblings is \boxed{84}.

The problem states that there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in a family. All sisters are the same age, which is 16. One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. 

First, we determine the age of the older brother:
- The younger brother is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother: \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

Next, we calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- The younger brother is 12 years old.
- The older brother is 24 years old.
- Each sister is 16 years old, and there are 3 sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\).

Adding up all the siblings' ages:
- Total age of the brothers: \(12 + 24 = 36\)
- Total age of the sisters: \(48\)
- Combined total age: \(36 + 48 = 84\)

Thus, the total age of all these siblings is \(\boxed{84}\).
