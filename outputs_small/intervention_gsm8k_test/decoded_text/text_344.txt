Q: At a restaurant, Juice Box A is 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. How much more is Juice box C than Juice Box B?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the price of each juice box.

Juice Box A costs $4.

Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so that would be $4 + $5 = $9.

Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so that would be $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, I subtract the price of B from the price of C: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the price of each juice box step by step.

1. **Price of Juice Box A:**
   \[
   \text{Price of A} = \$4
   \]

2. **Price of Juice Box B:**
   \[
   \text{Price of B} = \text{Price of A} + \$5 = \$4 + \$5 = \$9
   \]

3. **Price of Juice Box C:**
   \[
   \text{Price of C} = \text{Price of A} + \$7 = \$4 + \$7 = \$11
   \]

4. **Difference in Price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Price of C} - \text{Price of B} = \$11 - \$9 = \$2
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
