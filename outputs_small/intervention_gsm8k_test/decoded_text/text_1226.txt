Q: A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount combined.

The manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. Adding these together gives $75. Applying a 20% discount to $75 results in a total of $59.50.

Next, I need to calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and each nail costs $3. Assuming she has 10 nails, the total cost for nail art is $30.

Finally, I add the discounted total of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art to find the overall amount Karen will pay.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the discounted total for manicure and pedicure:**

   - **Manicure:** \$35
   - **Pedicure:** \$40
   - **Total before discount:** \$35 + \$40 = \$75

   - **20% discount:** 
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } \$75 = 0.20 \times 75 = \$15
     \]
   
   - **Total after discount:** 
     \[
     \$75 - \$15 = \$60
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of nail art:**

   - **Cost per nail:** \$3
   - **Number of nails:** 10 (assuming Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 fingers)
   - **Total cost for nail art:** 
     \[
     10 \times \$3 = \$30
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Karen will pay:**

   \[
   \$60 \text{ (manicure and pedicure)} + \$30 \text{ (nail art)} = \boxed{\$90}
   \]
