Q: Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. If her shoes cost $80, how much did her bag cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of Jillian's shoes, which is given as $80.

Next, I'll calculate three times the cost of the shoes. Multiplying $80 by 3 gives $240.

Finally, since the handbag costs $20 less than three times the cost of the shoes, I'll subtract $20 from $240 to find the total cost of the handbag.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the cost of Jillian's handbag step by step.

1. **Cost of Shoes:**
   - The cost of the shoes is given as \$80.

2. **Calculate Three Times the Cost of Shoes:**
   - Three times the cost of the shoes is:
     \[
     3 \times \$80 = \$240
     \]

3. **Determine the Cost of the Handbag:**
   - The handbag costs \$20 less than three times the cost of the shoes:
     \[
     \$240 - \$20 = \$220
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$220}
\]
