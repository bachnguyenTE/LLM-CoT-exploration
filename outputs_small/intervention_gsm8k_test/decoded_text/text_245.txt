Q: There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about snails and fish in two aquariums. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. So, that's straightforward—4 and 32 snails respectively. Then it mentions that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. It also says that both aquariums have the same number of fish. So, I need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, each has F fish. 

Now, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4, which is 28 snails. The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, the difference in snails is 28, and that's equal to twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Wait, that seems right. So, 28 = 2 * (F + F). Because each aquarium has F fish, so together they have 2F fish. Then, twice that amount would be 2*(2F) = 4F. So, 28 = 4F.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

Difference in snails = 32 - 4 = 28

Difference in snails = 2 * (Total fish in both aquariums)

Total fish in both aquariums = F + F = 2F

So, 28 = 2 * (2F) = 4F

So, 28 = 4F

Therefore, F = 28 / 4 = 7

So, each aquarium has 7 fish.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check again.

If each aquarium has 7 fish, then the total fish in both is 14. Twice that is 28. The difference in snails is 28, which matches. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7.

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.

The problem says the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, difference in snails is 28, which is equal to twice the total fish. So, 28 = 2*(F + F) = 4F, so F=7. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer is 7 fish in each aquarium.

**Final Answer**
The number of fish in each aquarium is \boxed{7}.

Given that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another, we need to find the number of fish in each aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, and both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, we calculate the difference in the number of snails:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ F + F = 2F \]

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\).
