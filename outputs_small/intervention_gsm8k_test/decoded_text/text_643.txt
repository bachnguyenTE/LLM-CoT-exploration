Q: A news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 28 days in the month.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of political and weather news articles published by the first company in February. Since the company averages 20 articles per day and February has 28 days, I'll multiply 20 by 28 to get the total for this company.

Next, I'll do the same calculation for the sister company, which averages 10 business news articles per day. Multiplying 10 by 28 will give me the total number of business news articles they publish in February.

Finally, I'll add the totals from both companies together to find the combined number of articles published by both companies in February.

To determine the total number of articles published by both news websites in February, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of political and weather news articles published by the first company in February:**
   
   - **Average daily articles:** 20
   - **Number of days in February:** 28
   
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 20 \,000 \times 28 = 560,00
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of business news articles published by the sister company in February:**
   
   - **Average daily articles:** 10
   - **Number of days in February:** 28
   
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 10 \times 28 = 280
   \]

3. **Add the totals from both companies to find the combined number of articles:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total combined articles} = 560,00 + 280 = 840,00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{84000}
\]
