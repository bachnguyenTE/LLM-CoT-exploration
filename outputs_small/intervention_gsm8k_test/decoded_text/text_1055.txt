Q: James has to buy insurance.  Since he had an accident it was 60% more than normal.  The normal cost is $120 a month.  How much does he pay a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so James has to buy insurance, and he had an accident that made it 60% more than normal. The normal cost is $120 a month. I need to figure out how much he pays a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the normal cost is $120 a month. But, that seems right. So, if he had an accident, the insurance would be 60% more than that. Wait, that seems right. So, I need to calculate the increased cost due to the accident and then add that to the normal cost.

Let me write this down. The normal cost is $120. The accident makes it 60% more. So, the extra amount he has to pay is 60% of $120. To find 60% of 120, I can convert the percentage to a decimal, which is 0.60, and multiply it by 120.

So, 0.60 * 120. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 120. Hmm, 0.6 * 100 is 60, and 0.6 * 20 is 12. So, 60 + 12 is 72. So, 0.60 * 120 is $72. So, the extra cost due to the accident is $72.

Therefore, the total monthly cost when he has an accident is the normal cost plus the extra. So, $120 + $72 is $192. So, each month, he has to pay $192.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 60% of 120 is 72, so adding that to 120 gives 192. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now, the question is asking how much he pays a year. So, I need to calculate the total cost for 12 months. So, $192 per month times 12 months.

Let me compute that. 192 * 12. Hmm, 192 *10 is 1920, and 192 *2 is 184, so adding those together, 1920 + 184 is 2104. So, $2104 per year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify the multiplication. 192 *12 is 384, so 192*12 is 192, 192*2 is 384, so 192*12 is 384, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 192*12 is 2104. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can break it down differently. 192 *12 is (200 - 8) *12. So, 200*12 is 400, and 8*12 is 96. So, 400 - 96 is 304. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
