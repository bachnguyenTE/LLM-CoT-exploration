Q: John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John doing several activities while on vacation. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, the problem says John spends 6 hours boating. Then, he spends half that time swimming. Hmm, so if he spent 6 hours boating, swimming would be half of that, which is 3 hours. Got that part. 

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. So, to find the total time he spent watching shows, I need to multiply the number of shows by the duration of each show. That would be 3 shows multiplied by 2 hours each. Let me write that down: 3 * 2 = 6 hours. So, he spent 6 hours watching shows. 

Now, the problem mentions that this total time of 6 hours watching shows was 30% of the time he spent. Wait, that seems right. So, 6 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. Hmm, okay. So, if 6 hours is 30% of the total time, I can use that to find the total time he spent. 

Let me denote the total time he spent as T. So, 30% of T is 6 hours. In mathematical terms, that would be 0.30 * T = 6. To find T, I can divide both sides by 0.30. So, T = 6 / 0.30. Let me calculate that. 6 divided by 0.3 is the same as 6 divided by 3/10, which is 6 * (10/3) = 20. So, T is 20 hours. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the total time he spent on all activities was 20 hours. Let me just verify that. If 30% of 20 hours is 6 hours, then yes, that's correct because 0.30 * 20 = 6. So, that checks out. 

Now, the problem also says that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, I need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing. Since the total time is 20 hours, and 40% of that is his sightseeing time. 

So, let me calculate 40% of 20 hours. 40% is the same as 0.40, so 0.40 * 20 = 8. So, he spent 8 hours sightseeing. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

He spent 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming, and 6 hours watching shows. So, 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours total for non-sightseeing activities. Then, the shows were 30% of his total time, which is 6 hours, so 6 / 0.30 = 20 hours total. 

So, 20 hours total, subtract the non-sightseeing time: 20 - 15 = 5 hours. Wait, that seems right. So, he spent 5 hours sightseeing. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
