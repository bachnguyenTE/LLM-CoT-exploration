Q: A custodian has to clean a school with 80 classrooms. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?

Okay, so I have this problem here where a custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days. Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean. They work 8 hours a day. I need to figure out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total time the custodian has. They have 5 days to clean all the classrooms. Each day they work 8 hours. So, to find the total time available, I can multiply the number of days by the hours per day. That would be 5 days multiplied by 8 hours. Let me write that down:

Total time available = 5 days × 8 hours/day = 40 hours.

Okay, so they have 40 hours in total to spend cleaning. Now, I need to find out how much time they actually spend cleaning. There are 80 classrooms, and each takes 15 minutes. So, the total cleaning time is 80 classrooms multiplied by 15 minutes per classroom. Let me calculate that:

Total cleaning time = 80 classrooms × 15 minutes/classroom.

Hmm, 80 times 15. Let me do that multiplication. 80 times 10 is 800, and 80 times 5 is 440. So, adding those together, 880 minutes. So, total cleaning time is 880 minutes.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 80 times 15 is 880. Yeah, that's correct. So, 880 minutes total.

But, that seems right. Now, I need to convert that into hours because the total time available is in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so I can divide the total minutes by 60 to get hours.

Total cleaning time in hours = 880 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour.

Let me compute that. 880 divided by 60. Hmm, 60 goes into 88 once, with 28 remaining. So, 1 hour and 28/60 hours. 28/60 can be simplified to 7/15, which is 1.4. So, 1.4 hours. Wait, that seems right. So, 1 hour and 28 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. 60 minutes is an hour, so 880 minutes is 1 hour and 28 minutes. So, 1.466... hours? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
