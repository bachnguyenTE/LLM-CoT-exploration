Q: Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away. If the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile, and Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, how much money will Milly lose?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total shipping cost for Milly's book. The book weighs 4 pounds and costs $32. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile for 20 miles.

Next, I'll compute the cost of shipping the book. Multiplying the weight by the poundage rate gives $1.40, and multiplying the distance by the mileage rate gives $0.64. Adding these together with the purchase price, the total shipping cost is $34.44.

However, Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. This means Milly will lose the remaining 25% of the purchase price, which is $8.00.

Finally, I'll add the shipping cost to the refund amount to determine the total loss. Milly will lose a total of $32.44.

To determine how much Milly will lose, let's break down the costs step by step.

### **1. Calculate the Shipping Cost**

- **Weight of the Book:** 4 pounds
- **Cost per Pound:** \$0.35
- **Distance to Distribution Center:** 20 miles
- **Cost per Mile:** \$0.08

**Shipping Cost = (Weight × Cost per Pound) + (Distance × Cost per Mile)**
\[
\text{Shipping Cost} = (4 \text{ lb} \times \$0.35/\text{lb}) + (20 \text{ mi} \times \$0.08/\text{mi})
\]
\[
\text{Shipping Cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.02
\]

**Total Cost Before Refund = Purchase Price + Shipping Cost**
\[
\text{Total Cost Before Refund} = \$32 + \$3.02 = \$35.02
\]

### **2. Calculate the Refund Amount**

- **Amazon Refund Percentage:** 75%

\[
\text{Refund Amount} = \text{Total Cost Before Refund} \times 75\%
\]
\[
\text{Refund Amount} = \$35.02 \times 0.75 = \$26.265
\]

### **3. Determine the Loss**

\[
\text{Loss} = \text{Total Cost Before Refund} - \text{Refund Amount}
\]
\[
\text{Loss} = \$35.02
\]

\[
\boxed{\$35.02}
\]
