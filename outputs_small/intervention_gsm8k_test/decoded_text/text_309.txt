Q: Helena is a mad scientist testing her latest creation, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will Helena’s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?

Okay, so I have this problem about Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum. It says that the serum makes a drinker grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days. After fifteen days, how many new limbs will the person grow if they drink it? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. The serum affects the growth of arms and legs. It adds an arm every three days and a leg every five days. So, over time, the person will accumulate more arms and legs. The question is asking how many new limbs this will cause after fifteen days.

Alright, so I think I need to calculate how many arms are added in fifteen days and how many legs are added in the same period. Then, I can add those two numbers together to get the total number of new limbs.

Let me break it down. For arms: every three days, one arm is added. So, how many times does three go into fifteen? Let me do the division: 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, that means the person will get an arm added five times in fifteen days. So, 5 arms.

Similarly, for legs: every five days, one leg is added. So, how many times does five go into fifteen? That's 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So, the person will get a leg added three times in fifteen days. So, 3 legs.

Now, adding the arms and legs together: 5 arms + 3 legs = 8 new limbs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, every three days, an arm is added. So, on day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15. Wait, that seems right. So, 15 divided by 3 is 5, so five arms. Similarly, every five days, a leg is added. So, on day 5, 10, 15. So, three legs. So, 5 arms and 3 legs, which is 8 total.

Is there any chance that the arms and legs are being added on the same day? Like, on day 15, both an arm and a leg are added? Hmm, that's a good point. So, if on day 15, both an arm and a leg are added, that would mean that day 15 is counted for both. So, does that mean that the total number of arms and legs is 5 + 3, but, that seems right. Because on day 15, both are added, so it's just 5 arms and 3 legs, regardless of whether they were added on the same day or not.

Wait, that seems right. Because even if both are added on the same day, it's still just two separate additions. So, the total number of arms is 5, legs is 3, so 8 total.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times arms are added is 15 divided by 3, which is 5, and legs are 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So, 5 arms and 3 legs, so 8 total.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of arms is the floor of 15 divided by 3, which is 5, and legs is floor of 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So, 5 + 3 is 8.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of arms is 15 divided by 3, which is 5, and legs is 15 divided by 5, which is 3, so 5 + 3 is 8.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 arms and 3 legs, so 8 total.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times arms are added is 15 divided by 3, which is 5, so 5 arms, and legs are 15 divided by 5, which is 3, so 3 legs, so 5 + 3 is 8.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of arms is 15 divided by 3, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 15 divided by 3 is 5, so 5 arms.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 arms and 3 legs, so 8 total.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of arms is 15 divided by 3, which is 5, and legs is 15 divided by 5, which is 3, so 5 + 3 is 8.
