Q: Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?

Okay, so Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes on a football field that's 100 yards long. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure out how far each of them runs and then see who wins and by how much.

First, let's break down Blake's run. He runs back and forth 15 times. Each time he goes back and forth means he covers the length of the field twice, right? So, each back-and-forth is 200 yards. Let me write that down.

Blake's total distance:
He does this 15 times, so 15 times 200 yards. Let me calculate that. 15 * 200. Hmm, 10 times 200 is 220 yards, so 15 times would be 5 * 220. Wait, that seems right. 220 * 5 is 1100 yards. So, Blake runs 1110 yards in total.

Now, let's move on to Kelly. She runs back and forth once, and then she decides to go to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Hmm, okay, so her first run is just once, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, let me parse this.

First, she runs back and forth once. So, that's 200 yards. Then, she goes to the 40-yard line and back. So, that's 40 yards each way, so 80 yards. So, each time she does this, she runs 200 + 80 yards. Let me calculate that.

Each time she does this, she runs 200 + 80 = 280 yards. So, she does this 34 times. So, her total distance is 34 * 280 yards. Let me compute that.

34 * 280. Hmm, 30 * 280 is 8400, and 4 *280 is 1280, so total is 8400 + 1280 = 9680 yards. So, Kelly runs 9680 yards in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, Blake ran 1110 yards, and Kelly ran 9680 yards. So, the difference is 9680 - 1110. Let me compute that.

9680 - 1110. Hmm, 9680 - 1000 is 8680, then subtract 110 more, so 8680 - 110 = 8570 yards. So, the winner, which is Kelly, runs 8570 yards farther than Blake.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Blake: 15 times back and forth. Each back and forth is 200 yards. So, 15 * 200 = 3000 yards. Wait, that seems right. 15 * 200 is 3000. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
