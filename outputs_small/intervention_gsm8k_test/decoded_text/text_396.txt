Q: Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. If Jenny eats 2 slices, how many slices are left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where Jenny is dividing up a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. Then, Jenny eats 2 slices. I need to figure out how many slices are left. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the pizza has 12 slices. Jenny is giving away some slices to Bill and Mark. So, I need to calculate how many slices each of them gets. Let me start with Bill. He gets 1/3 of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, I can find 1/3 of 12 by dividing 12 by 3. Let me do that: 12 divided by 3 is 4. So, Bill gets 4 slices.

Next, Mark gets 1/4 of the pizza. Again, the pizza has 12 slices, so I need to find 1/4 of 12. To do that, I can divide 12 by 4. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, Mark gets 3 slices.

Now, I need to find out how many slices Jenny has left after giving some to Bill and Mark. She started with 12 slices. She gave 4 to Bill and 3 to Mark. So, I should subtract the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total. Let me write that down: 12 minus 4 minus 3. 

Calculating that, 12 minus 4 is 8, and then 8 minus 3 is 5. So, Jenny has 5 slices left after giving some to Bill and Mark.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 1/3 of 12 is 4, 1/4 of 12 is 3, so 4 plus 3 is 7 slices given away. 12 minus 7 is 5. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, Jenny eats 2 slices. So, from the 5 slices she has left, she eats 2. So, I need to subtract 2 from 5. That would be 5 minus 2, which is 3. So, 3 slices are left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The pizza is divided into 12 slices, but, that seems right. So, 12 slices, 1/3 to Bill, 1/4 to Mark, and 2 eaten by Jenny. So, 12 slices given away, 2 eaten, so 12 minus 2 is 0, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
