Q: Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of bugs Dax found. The problem states that there are half as many bugs as ants. Since there are 50 ants, I can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.

Next, I'll add the number of ants and bugs together to find the total number of insects in the garden.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Ants:**
   - Given: There are **50 ants** in the garden.

2. **Number of Bugs:**
   - It's stated that Dax found **half as many bugs** as ants.
   - **Number of Bugs** = \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Ants}\)
   - **Number of Bugs** = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

3. **Total Number of Insects:**
   - **Total Insects** = **Number of Ants** + **Number of Bugs**
   - **Total Insects** = \(50 + 25 = 75\)

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{75}
