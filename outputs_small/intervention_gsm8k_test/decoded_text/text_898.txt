Q: Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.

Okay, so I have this problem here where Dijana and Anis live near a lake and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing. Dijana rowed for the whole day and covered 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. I need to calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Dijana rowed 50 miles on Sunday morning. Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana. So, Anis's rowing distance is Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of Dijana's distance. That makes sense because "times more" usually means an increase by that fraction.

So, if Dijana rowed 50 miles, then Anis rowed 50 miles plus 1/5 of 50 miles. Let me write that down:

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5) * Dijana's distance

Which is:

Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5)*50

Let me compute that. First, 1/5 of 50 is... 50 divided by 5 is 10. So, 1/5 of 50 is 10. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, Anis rowed 60 miles. Let me double-check that. If Dijana did 50, and Anis did 1/5 more, then 1/5 of 50 is 10, so 50 +10 is 60. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, now, to find the total distance they both rowed, I need to add Dijana's distance and Anis's distance together.

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance

Which is:

Total distance = 50 + 60

So, 50 + 60 is 110.

Therefore, the total distance they rowed together is 110 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, Dijana: 50 miles. Anis: 50 + (1/5)*50 = 50 +10=60. Total:50+60=110. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that if Anis rowed 1/5 times more, that means Anis's distance is 6/5 of Dijana's distance. Because 1 + 1/5 is 6/5. So, Anis's distance is 6/5 * Dijana's distance.

So, Anis's distance = (6/5)*50 = (6*50)/5 = 300/5 =60. So, same result.

Therefore, total distance is 50 +60=110.

So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \boxed{110} miles.

Dijana rowed 50 miles on Sunday morning. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find Anis's distance, we calculate:

\[
\text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\right) = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis gives the total distance:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \boxed{110} miles.
