Q: There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Anthony and his father filling a water tank, and then using it to water their garden. I need to figure out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are 10,0000 gallons of water in a pool. Wait, that seems right. Then, they use a water pump to fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Hmm, so the pool has 10,000 gallons, so half of that would be... let me calculate that. Half of 10,000 is 5,0000 gallons. So, the tank gets filled with 5,000 gallons of water.

Now, they use this water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, every day, 500 gallons are taken out. The question is, how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days?

Alright, so let's see. The tank starts with 5,000 gallons. Each day, 500 gallons are removed. So, over 6 days, how much water is used?

I think I can calculate the total water used by multiplying the daily rate by the number of days. So, 550 gallons per day times 6 days. Let me write that out: 550 * 6.

Hmm, 550 times 6. Let me compute that. 500 * 6 is... 500*6. 500*6 is 3,000. Wait, that seems right. Because 500*6 is 3,000. So, 550*6 is 3,300. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 500*6 is 3,000, and 50*6 is 300, so 3,000 + 300 is 3,300. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 550 gallons per day for 6 days is 3,300 gallons. So, they used 3,300 gallons of water from the tank over 6 days.

Now, the tank started with 5,000 gallons. So, subtracting the water used, 5,000 - 3,300. Let me compute that. 5,000 minus 3,300 is... 1,700 gallons. So, 1,700 gallons of water will be left in the tank after 6 days.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 10,000 gallons in the pool. Half of that is 5,000 gallons in the tank. Each day, 550 gallons are removed. Over 6 days, that's 550*6=3,300 gallons. So, 5,000 - 3,300 = 1,700 gallons remaining. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key steps were figuring out how much water was in the tank initially, calculating the total water removed over 6 days, and then subtracting that from the initial amount. Everything seems to add up.

So, I think the answer is 1,700 gallons remaining in the tank after 6 days.

**Final Answer**
The amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is \boxed{1700} gallons.

The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool, which is:

\[
\frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The tank is emptied at a rate of 550 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total water removed from the tank is:

\[
550 \times 6 = 3,300 \text{ gallons}
\]

Subtracting the total water removed from the initial amount in the tank:

\[
5,000 - 3,300 = 1,700 \text{ gallons}
\]

The amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is \boxed{1700} gallons.
