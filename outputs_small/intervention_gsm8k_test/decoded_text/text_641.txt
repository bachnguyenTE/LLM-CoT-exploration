Q: Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tim is getting a promotion that gives him a 5% raise on his current $20000 monthly salary. Plus, he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. I need to figure out how much he'll make in a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out what his new monthly salary will be after the 5% raise. His current salary is $20000, right? So, a 5% raise means he's getting 5% of $20000 added to his current salary. Let me calculate that.

5% of $20000 is... well, 10% is $2000, so 5% would be 5 times that. Let me do the math: 5 * $20000. Hmm, 5 * 20000. Let me compute that. 5 * 20000 is 100000. So, $10000. So, the raise is $10000. Therefore, his new monthly salary after the raise is his original salary plus the raise. So, $200000 + $10000 = $30000. Okay, so his new monthly salary is $30000.

Wait, that seems right. 5% of 20000 is 10000, so adding that to 200000 gives 30000. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, he also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. So, half a month's salary is half of $30000. Let me calculate that. Half of 30000 is 15000. So, the bonus is $15000.

So, in total, his monthly income after the raise and the bonus is his new salary plus the bonus. So, $30000 + $15000. Let me add those together. 30000 + 15000 is 45000. So, he makes $45000 each month.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 5% of 20000 is 1000, so 20000 + 1000 is 21000. Then, 21000 + 15000 is 36000. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
