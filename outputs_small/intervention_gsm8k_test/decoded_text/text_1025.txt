Q: The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the Easter egg hunt. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. That's the total number of eggs. Then, it mentions that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Hmm, so if there are two Smith twins, each found 30 eggs, that means together they found 30 eggs each. Let me write that down:

Smith twins found: 30 eggs each × 2 = 60 eggs.

So, the Smith twins found a total of 60 eggs. Now, the problem also says that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Wait, that seems right. So, out of the total 100 eggs, 11 were not found by the Smith twins. That means the friends found the remaining eggs.

Let me break it down:

Total eggs: 100

Smith twins found: 60

So, the eggs found by friends and the 11 eggs not found by Smith twins should add up to the total. So, the eggs found by friends would be total eggs minus the ones found by Smith twins minus the 11 eggs.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that as an equation:

Friends found = Total eggs - Smith twins found - 11

Plugging in the numbers:

Friends found = 100 - 60 -11

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that.

100 minus 60 is 34, and then minus 11 is 23. So, the friends found 23 eggs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Total eggs: 100

Smith twins found: 30 each, so 30 × 2 = 60

So, 100 - 60 = 40 eggs found by others.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
