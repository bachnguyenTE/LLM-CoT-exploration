Q: Mason is on his bike journey at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours. How many miles has he traveled in total?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mason's bike journey. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says Mason is traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He goes on a bike journey for 4 hours, then takes some rest, and then continues for another 6 hours. The question is asking how many miles he has traveled in total.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then add them together. Since he's moving at a constant speed, I can use the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. That formula is pretty straightforward, right?

Let me write that down. The formula is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for the first part of his journey, he's traveling for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour. Let me plug in those numbers.

First part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \,0 \text{ hours} \]

Wait, that seems right. So, 8 multiplied by 4. Let me do that multiplication. 8 times 4 is 32. So, he covers 32 miles in the first 4 hours.

Now, after taking a rest, he continues his journey for another 6 hours. So, the second part is 6 hours at the same speed of 8 mph. Let me calculate that.

Second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 6 \, \text{hours} \]

Again, 8 multiplied by 6. Hmm, 8 times 6 is 48. So, he covers 48 miles in the next 6 hours.

Now, to find the total distance he has traveled, I need to add both parts together. That would be 32 miles plus 48 miles.

Total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding those together, 32 plus 48. Let me do that. 32 plus 40 is 72, and then plus 8 is 80. Wait, that seems right. 32 plus 48 is 80.

So, putting it all together, he traveled 32 miles in the first 4 hours and 48 miles in the next 6 hours, totaling 80 miles.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 8 times 4 is definitely 32, and 8 times 6 is 48. Adding those together, 32 plus 48 is 80. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward, just two segments of his journey at the same speed, so adding the distances should give the total. I don't see any complications like different speeds or stops in between, so it's just a simple addition.

So, yeah, I think the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles.

**Final Answer**
Mason has traveled a total of \boxed{80} miles.

Mason is traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours, then takes a rest, and continues for another 6 hours. To find the total distance he has traveled, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \,0 \text{ mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{ miles} \]

For the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \,0 \text{ mph} \times 6 \, \text{ hours} = 48 \, \text{ miles} \]

Adding both distances together gives the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{ miles} = 80 \, \text{ miles} \]

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
