Q: Patricia has 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother. She bought 15 more roses.  How many roses did she have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Patricia starts with 300 roses.

She gives away 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 300, leaving her with 276 roses.

Then, she buys 15 more roses, so we add 15 to 276, resulting in a total of 291 roses.
</think>

**Solution:**

Patricia begins with **300 roses**.

1. **Giving Roses to Her Mother:**
   - She gives **24 roses** to her mother.
   - Remaining roses: \( 300 - 24 = 276 \)

2. **Buying More Roses:**
   - She buys **15 more roses**.
   - Total roses now: \( 276 + 15 = 291 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{291}
\]
