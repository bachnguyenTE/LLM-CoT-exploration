Q: Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali’s class which has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ali and John, both deans of their respective schools, and I need to figure out the combined capacity of both schools. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that John has two classes in his public school. Each of these classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which has 120 students. So, I need to find out how many students each of John's classes has and then add them together to get the total capacity of his school. Then, I can compare that to Ali's school to find the combined capacity.

Let me write down what I know:

- Ali's class has 120 students.
- John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class.
- John has two classes.

So, first, I need to find out how many students are in each of John's classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, I can calculate that by dividing 120 by 8.

Let me do that calculation: 120 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 15 is 120, right? So, 120 divided by 8 is 15. So, each of John's classes has 15 students.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 8 times 15 is 120, so yes, 120 divided by 8 is indeed 15. So, each class has 15 students.

Now, since John has two classes, each with 15 students, the total number of students in his school would be 15 multiplied by 2. Let me calculate that: 15 times 2 is 30. So, John's school has a combined capacity of 30 students.

Now, Ali's school has one class with 120 students. So, the combined capacity of both schools would be the sum of Ali's school and John's school. That would be 120 plus 30.

Let me add those together: 120 plus 30 is 150. So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Ali's class: 120 students.

John's classes: Each has 1/8 of 120, which is 15. Two classes, so 15 times 2 is 30.

Total combined capacity: 120 plus 30 is 150.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 150.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios or proportions. Since each of John's classes is 1/8 the size of Ali's, and he has two classes, so the total for John is 2*(1/8)*120.

Calculating that: 2*(1/8) is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4. So, 1/4 of 120 is 30. So, that's the same as before.

So, 30 plus 120 is 150. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of fractions. If each of John's classes is 1/8 of Ali's, then the total number of students in both classes is 2*(1/8) = 1/4 of Ali's class. So, 1/4 of 120 is 30, which is 30. So, same as before.

So, either way, whether I calculate each class separately and add them, or calculate the total as a fraction of Ali's school, I get the same result.

So, 150 is the combined capacity.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 150.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any chance I misread the problem.

The problem says: "John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali’s class which has the capacity of 120 students."

So, each of John's classes is 1/8 of 120, which is 15, times two is 30. So, 30 is John's school, 120 is Ali's, so total is 150.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a ratio, the ratio of John's school to Ali's school is 30:120, which simplifies to
