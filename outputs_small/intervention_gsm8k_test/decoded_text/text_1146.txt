Q: Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, I'll divide his total money by the cost per rock.

Next, I'll calculate the revenue from selling the rocks. He plans to sell 60% of his inventory, so I'll multiply the number of rocks he bought by 66% to find out how many he'll sell.

Then, I'll find out how much money he makes from selling those rocks by multiplying the number of sold rocks by the selling price per rock.

After that, I'll subtract the revenue from the total investment to find out how much money he has left.

Finally, I'll determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the total investment.

**Solution:**

Adam has **\$100** to invest in a rock stand. He buys rocks for **\$5** each and sells them for **\$7** each. He sells **66%** of his inventory.

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam buys:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of rocks sold:**
   
   \[
   \text{Rocks sold} = 66\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.66 \times 20 = 13.2 \text{ rocks}
   \]
   
   Since Adam can't sell a fraction of a rock, we'll consider he sells **13** rocks.

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the loss:**
   
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total investment} - \text{Revenue} = 100 - 91 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
