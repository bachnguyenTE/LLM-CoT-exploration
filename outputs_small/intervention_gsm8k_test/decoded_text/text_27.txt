Q: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cynthia buying ice cream. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. That means she eats one serving each day, right? So, over 60 days, how many servings does she eat? Hmm, let me calculate that. If she eats one serving each day, then in 60 days, she would eat 60 servings. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, she buys cartons of ice cream, and each carton has 15 servings. So, each time she buys a carton, she's getting 15 servings. I need to figure out how many cartons she needs to buy to have enough ice cream for 60 servings. 

To find out how many cartons she needs, I can divide the total number of servings she wants by the number of servings per carton. So, that would be 60 servings divided by 15 servings per carton. Let me do that division: 60 ÷ 15. Hmm, 15 goes into 60 how many times? Well, 15 times 4 is 60, right? So, she needs 4 cartons. 

Wait, that seems right. 15 times 4 is 60, so yes, exactly 4 cartons. So, she needs to buy 4 cartons of ice cream. 

Each carton costs $4.000. So, to find the total cost, I need to multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton. That would be 4 cartons multiplied by $4.00 per carton. Let me calculate that: 4 times 4 is 16, and 4 times 00 is 0. So, 4 times 4.00 is $16.00. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 4 cartons at $4 each is $16. So, she will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days. 

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She eats one serving a night, so 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so 60 divided by 15 is 4. Each carton is $4, so 4 times 4 is $16. Yeah, that seems correct. 

I don't think I missed anything here. It's pretty straightforward. She buys enough cartons to cover her consumption over 60 days, and each carton is a fixed cost. So, the total cost is just the number of cartons multiplied by the price per carton. 

I guess another way to think about it is, how much does she spend each day? She spends $4.00 divided by 15 servings, which is about $0.2667 per serving. Then, over 60 days, she eats 60 servings, so 60 times $0.2667 is approximately $16.00. That matches my earlier calculation. 

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is $16.00. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. 

**Final Answer**
Cynthia will spend \boxed{16} dollars on ice cream after 60 days.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she needs 60 servings over 60 days. Each carton contains 15 servings, so she needs:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings per carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00 \text{ per carton} = \$16.00
\]

Thus, Cynthia will spend \boxed{16} dollars on ice cream after 60 days.
