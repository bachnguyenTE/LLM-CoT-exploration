Q: Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Cecelia went to the milk store and bought some jars. The problem says that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. It also tells me that a gallon jar costs $5. I need to find out how much she spent in total on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the cost of a half-gallon jar. The problem says that a gallon jar is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So if I let the cost of a half-gallon jar be, say, x dollars, then the cost of a gallon jar would be x + $2. But, that seems right. So, if a gallon jar is $5, then I can set up an equation:

x + 2 = 5

To find x, I subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 5 - 2
x = 3

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3. That makes sense because $3 plus $2 is $5 for the gallon jar.

Now, the problem asks for the total amount she spent on buying 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. Wait, that seems right. 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. Let me confirm: 10 gallons and 16 half-gallons. Yeah, that's what it says.

So, I need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. Let me write that down.

First, the cost for the gallon jars. Each gallon jar is $5, so for 10 of them, it would be 10 multiplied by $5.

10 * $5 = $50

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the cost for the half-gallon jars. Each half-gallon is $3, so for 16 of them, it would be 16 multiplied by $3.

16 * $3 = $48

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 10 times 5 is 50, and 16 times 3 is 48. So, adding those together should give the total amount spent.

So, total cost = $50 + $48 = $98

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them again: 50 plus 48. 50 plus 40 is 50, then plus 8 is 58. Wait, that seems right. 50 plus 48 is 98? Wait, that seems right. 50 + 48 is 98? Wait, that seems right. 50 + 48 is 98? Wait, that seems right. 50 + 48 is 98? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 50 + 48 is 98? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
