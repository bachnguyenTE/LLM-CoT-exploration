Q: Every hour, Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven.  Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices and wrapped individually for sale.  Each slice is sold for 50 cents for a fundraiser.  If she baked from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM straight, and sold all the slices, how much did she raise in dollars?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Paige raised by baking banana bread and selling the slices. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's see how long she baked. She started at 1:00 PM and ended at 6:00 PM. Hmm, so that's from 1:00 to 6:00. Let me count the hours. From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is one hour, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is two hours, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is three hours, 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is four hours, and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM is five hours. Wait, that seems right. So she baked for 5 hours.

Now, every hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. So in 5 hours, how many loaves does she bake? That should be 2 loaves/hour multiplied by 5 hours. Let me write that down: 2 * 5 = 10 loaves. So she made 10 banana bread loaves.

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, how many slices does she have in total? That would be 10 loaves * 8 slices per loaf. Let me calculate that: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. So she has 80 slices of banana bread.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, how much money does she make from selling all the slices? That would be 80 slices * $0.50 per slice. Hmm, 80 times 0.50. Let me compute that. 80 * 0.50. Well, 80 * 0.5 is 40, and 80 * 0.00 is 0, so total is 40 dollars. Wait, that seems right. 80 slices at 50 cents each is 40 dollars.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She bakes 2 loaves per hour, 5 hours, so 10 loaves. Each loaf is 8 slices, so 10*8=80 slices. Each slice is 50 cents, so 80*0.50=40. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. She baked continuously from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours, baked 2 loaves each hour, so 10 loaves, each cut into 8 slices, so 80 slices, sold each for 50 cents, so 40 dollars total. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{40}
</think>

Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. She bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. 

The number of banana bread loaves baked is:
\[ 2 \,000 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount of money raised is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

\[
\boxed{40}
