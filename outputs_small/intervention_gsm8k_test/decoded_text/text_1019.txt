Q: On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  How many guests does the hotel now have?

Okay, so I have this problem about a hotel with 100 guests on a busy Saturday morning. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, the hotel is completely booked with 100 guests. That means all 100 are there at the start. Now, 24 guests decided to check out early, and 15 chose to check out late. Hmm, so that's 24 + 15 = 39 guests leaving. So, how many are left in the hotel? Well, 100 - 39 = 61. So, 61 guests are still there after the early and late checkouts. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 100 minus 39 is 61. Okay, moving on. Then, in the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Hmm, let me parse that. So, the number of people who checked in in the afternoon is twice the number who checked out late. Since 15 people checked out late, then twice that is 30. So, 30 people checked in in the afternoon. 

But, that seems right. So, 30 people came in during the afternoon. Then, 7 more people checked in after dinner was served. So, that's another 7 people. So, total check-ins in the afternoon and after dinner would be 30 +7 = 37. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 37 people came in after the checkouts and after dinner. So, how does this affect the total number of guests? 

So, initially, after the early and late checkouts, there were 61 guests. Then, in the afternoon, 30 people checked in, so that adds 30 to the count. Then, 7 more after dinner, so that adds another 7. So, total guests now would be 61 +30 +7. Let me calculate that: 61 +30 is 91, plus 7 is 98. So, 98 guests in total. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 

Start with 100. Subtract 24 and 15: 100 -24=76, 76-15=61. Then, in the afternoon, twice as many as late checkout: 2*15=30. So, 61 +30=91. Then, 7 more after dinner: 91 +7=98. Yeah, that seems correct. 

So, the hotel now has 98 guests. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if I missed anything. The problem says "how many guests does the hotel now have?" So, 100 initially, minus 24 and 15, which is 39, so 61 left. Then, in the afternoon, twice as many as those who checked out late, which is 30, so 61 +30=91, then 7 more after dinner, so 98. Yeah, that seems correct. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 98. 

**Final Answer**
The hotel now has \boxed{98} guests.

The hotel starts with 100 guests. 

1. 24 guests checked out early, and 15 guests checked out late. 
   - Total guests leaving: \(24 + 15 = 39\)
   - Guests remaining: \(100 - 39 = 61\)

2. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. 
   - Twice the number of late checkout guests: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests checking in in the afternoon: 30

3. Additionally, 7 more people checked in after dinner. 
   - Total check-ins in the afternoon and after dinner: \(30 + 7 = 37\)

4. Adding these check-ins to the remaining guests:
   - Total guests now: \(61 + 30 + 7 = 98\)

Thus, the hotel now has \(\boxed{98}\) guests.
