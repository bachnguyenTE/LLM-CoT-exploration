Q: Caroline is three times older than Ben. Ben is two times older than Chris. If Chris is 4, how old is Caroline?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Caroline is three times older than Ben. Ben is two times older than Chris. If Chris is 4, how old is Caroline? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what "three times older" means. I think it means that Caroline's age is three times Ben's age. So, if Ben is, say, 10, Caroline would be 30. That makes sense. So, mathematically, I can write that as Caroline = 3 * Ben.

Similarly, Ben is two times older than Chris. So, Ben's age is twice Chris's age. If Chris is 4, then Ben would be 2 * 4, which is 8. That seems straightforward.

So, let me break it down. Chris is 4. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is 2 * 4. Let me write that down:

Ben = 2 * Chris
Ben = 2 * 4
Ben = 8

Okay, so Ben is 8 years old. Now, Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, Caroline's age is 3 times Ben's age. So, mathematically, that would be:

Caroline = 3 * Ben
Caroline = 3 * 8

Let me calculate that. 3 multiplied by 8 is 24. So, Caroline is 24 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Chris is 4, Ben is 8, and Caroline is 24. So, 24 is three times 8, which is Ben's age, and 8 is two times 4, which is Chris's age. So, all the relationships hold true.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. Sometimes, when people say "three times older," they might mean something else, like three times as old, but, that seems right. So, Caroline is 24.

**Final Answer**
Caroline is \boxed{24} years old.

Chris is 4 years old. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Ben} = 2 \times \text{Chris} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Caroline} = 3 \times \text{Ben} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Thus, Caroline is \boxed{24} years old.
