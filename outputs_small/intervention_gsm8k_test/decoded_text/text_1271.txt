Q: A large bag of Starbursts candy has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.  If this bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies and half as many yellow candies as red candies, how many candies are pink?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Starbursts candies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there's a bag with 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. That's the total number, right? So, I know that the total is 232. Now, it mentions different colors: red, orange, yellow, and pink. I need to find out how many are pink.

Let me break down the information given:

- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies.
- We need to find the number of pink candies.

Alright, so let's start by writing down what we know.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: twice the number of red candies
3. Yellow candies: half the number of red candies
4. Total candies: 232

So, first, I can calculate the number of orange and yellow candies based on the red ones.

Starting with orange candies: twice the number of red candies. Since red is 54, twice that would be 54 * 2. Let me compute that.

54 * 2 = 108. So, there are 108 orange candies.

Next, yellow candies: half the number of red candies. Red is 54, so half of that is 54 / 2. Let me calculate that.

54 / 2 = 27. So, there are 27 yellow candies.

Now, let me add up all the candies we know: red, orange, and yellow. That should give me the total number of these three colors.

Red: 54
Orange: 108
Yellow: 27

Adding them together: 54 + 108 +27.

Let me do that step by step.

54 + 108: 54 + 108. 54 + 100 is 154, and 108 is 108, so 154 + 108. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
