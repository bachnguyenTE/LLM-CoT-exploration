Q: Jack had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. How many dollars does Jack have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much Sophia gave Jack. She gave him 1/5 of her $100.

To calculate this, I multiply 1/5 by 100, which equals $20.

Next, I add the $20 Sophia gave Jack to the original $100 Jack already had.

Adding these amounts together, Jack now has a total of $120.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine how much Sophia gave Jack:**
   
   Sophia gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her \$100.
   
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
   \]
   
   So, Sophia gave Jack \$20.

2. **Calculate the total amount Jack has now:**
   
   Jack originally had \$100. He received an additional \$20 from Sophia.
   
   \[
   100 + 20 = 120
   \]
   
   Therefore, Jack now has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars.
