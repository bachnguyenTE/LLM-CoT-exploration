Q: Sam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. But, that seems right. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't work those days. Then, on the weekend, which I assume is Saturday and Sunday, he sold 20 crates. Wait, that seems right. So, let me note down all the days he worked and how many crates he sold each day.

He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he worked Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday and Sunday. Let me list the days and the crates sold:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates

Wait, that seems right. So, let me add up all the crates he sold during the week.

First, let's add Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 +18. Let me compute that. 15 +12 is 27, and 27 +18 is 45. So, 45 crates from Tuesday to Thursday.

Then, on the weekend, he sold 20 crates on Saturday and 20 crates on Sunday. So, 20 +20 is 40 crates.

So, total crates sold during the week: 45 (Tuesday to Thursday) + 40 (weekend) = 85 crates.

Wait, that seems right. So, he sold 85 crates in the week. His target was 120 crates. So, how much was he off?

I think it's the difference between his target and what he actually sold. So, 120 -85. Let me compute that. 120 -85 is 35. So, he was 35 crates short of his target.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 35 crates.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total sold: 15 +12 +18 +20 +20.

15 +12 is 17, 17 +18 is 25, 25 +20 is 45, 45 +20 is 65. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
