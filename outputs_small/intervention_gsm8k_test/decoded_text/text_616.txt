Q: Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?

Okay, so I have this problem about Jane's beanstalk. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that after the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. Then, it doubled in height the second week. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. I need to find out how tall the beanstalk was after three weeks.

Alright, let's break it down week by week. First week is straightforward: it's 3 inches tall. So, after week one, height is 3 inches. Got that.

Now, the second week is where it doubles in height. So, if it was 3 inches at the end of week one, doubling that would mean 3 times 2, right? Let me calculate that. 3 times 2 is 6. So, after week two, the beanstalk is 6 inches tall. That makes sense because it doubled from the previous week.

Moving on to the third week, it says it grew another 4 inches. Hmm, so does that mean it added 4 inches to the previous week's height, or does it mean it doubled again? Wait, that seems right. It says it grew another 4 inches, so that's an addition, not a doubling. So, after week two, it was 6 inches, and then in week three, it adds 4 inches. So, 6 plus 4 is 10 inches. So, after three weeks, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check. Week one: 3 inches. Week two: doubles to 6 inches. Week three: adds 4 inches, so 6 + 4 = 10 inches. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. It says it grew another 4 inches in the third week. So, does that mean it's 4 inches taller than the previous week, or is it 4 inches in total? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "it grew another 4 inches," which could mean that it added 4 inches to whatever it was before. So, if it was 6 inches at the end of week two, then adding 4 inches would make it 10 inches at the end of week three.

Alternatively, if it had doubled again, it would have been 12 inches, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 3 inches, then 6 inches, then 10 inches. So, 10 inches is the total height after three weeks.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way. Maybe the growth is compounded? But, that seems right. It's not compounded in the way that, for example, if it was doubling each week, but, that seems right. So, week one: 3 inches, week two: 6 inches, week three: 10 inches.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3, 6, 10. So, 10 inches is the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after three weeks.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The beanstalk was \boxed{10} inches tall after three weeks.
</think>

After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height during the second week, making it 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, resulting in a total height of 10 inches.

\[
\text{Height after week 1} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
\text{Height after week 2} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
\text{Height after week 3} = 6 + 4 = 10 \text{ inches}
\]

The beanstalk was \boxed{10} inches tall after three weeks.
