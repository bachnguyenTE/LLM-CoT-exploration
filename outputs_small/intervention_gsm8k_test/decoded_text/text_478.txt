Q: A company decided to take its employees on a tour to explore an ancient site. The employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees. Each group was assigned 7 tour guides. How many is the total number of people going on this tour?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of employees. There are 3 groups, each consisting of 200 employees. So, I'll multiply the number of groups by the number of employees per group.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of tour guides. Each group is assigned 7 tour guides, so I'll multiply the number of groups by the number of guides per group.

Finally, to find the total number of people going on the tour, I'll add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides together.

To determine the total number of people going on the tour, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of Groups:** 3
2. **Employees per Group:** 200
3. **Tour Guides per Group:** 7

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Employees**

\[
\text{Total Employees} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Employees per Group} = 3 \times 200 = 600
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Tour Guides**

\[
\text{Total Tour Guides} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Tour Guides per Group} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of People Going on the Tour**

\[
\text{Total People} = \text{Total Employees} + \text{Total Tour Guides} = 660 + 21 = 681
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{681}
\]
