Q: A tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. What is the tank’s water depth on Wednesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about the depth of water in a tank over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, on Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet. That seems straightforward. Then, on Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet. Hmm, so I need to calculate the depth on Tuesday. Let me write that down.

Monday: 17 feet

Tuesday: 17 feet + 7 feet = ?

Wait, that seems right. So, 17 plus 7 is 24. So, on Tuesday, the depth is 24 feet. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, moving on to Wednesday. The problem says that the depth on Wednesday is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, I need to find two-thirds of 24 feet. Let me write that down.

Tuesday: 24 feet

Wednesday: (2/3) * 24 feet

Hmm, okay. So, I need to compute two-thirds of 24. Let me think about how to do that. Well, two-thirds is the same as multiplying 24 by 2 and then dividing by 3, right? Or, alternatively, I can divide 24 by 3 and then multiply by 2. Either way, it should give me the same result.

Let me try both methods to make sure I get the same answer.

First method: Multiply 24 by 2, which is 48, then divide by 3. 48 divided by 3 is 16. So, that gives me 16 feet.

Second method: Divide 24 by 3, which is 8, then multiply by 2. 8 times 2 is 16. Same result. Okay, so that seems consistent.

So, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is 16 feet.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Monday: 17 feet

Tuesday: 17 + 7 = 24 feet

Wednesday: (2/3)*24 = 16 feet

Yes, that all adds up. So, the depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. It says the depth on Tuesday is 7 feet more than Monday, so 17 + 7 is 24. Then, Wednesday is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth, so 2/3 of 24 is 16. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. 17 plus 7 is definitely 24, and two-thirds of 24 is 16. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is \boxed{16} feet.
</think>

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet. 

On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet:
\[ 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet.
