Q: Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house to make a repair, plus $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, plus parts. One job took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts. How much did Patty charge?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Patty's Plumbing charged for a job. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Patty charges $40 to visit a house for a repair. That seems like a one-time fee. Then, for labor, they charge $35 per hour, but, that seems right. It says "part thereof" for labor, which I think means that if they work more than an hour, they still charge an extra hour. So, if it's 2.25 hours, they would charge for 3 hours. Got it.

Also, there's a part mentioned, which is $60 in parts. Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost would be the visit fee plus the labor cost plus the parts cost.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, the visit fee is $40. That's straightforward.

Next, the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours. Since they charge per hour, but, that seems right. So, if it's 2.25 hours, they charge for 3 hours because it's part thereof. So, 3 hours times $35 per hour.

Let me calculate that: 3 * 35. Hmm, 3*30 is 90, and 3*5 is 15, so 90 + 15 is 105. So, labor cost is $105.

Then, the parts cost is $60. Wait, that seems right. So, $60 in parts.

Now, adding all these together: visit fee + labor + parts.

So, 40 + 105 +60.

Let me add 40 and 105 first. 40 +105 is 149. Then, 149 +60 is 209.

Wait, that seems right. So, total charge is $209.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Visit fee: $40.

Labor: 2.25 hours. Since it's part thereof, they charge for 3 hours. 3*35 is 105.

Parts: $60.

Total: 40 +105 +60.

40 +105 is 145, plus 60 is 205. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
