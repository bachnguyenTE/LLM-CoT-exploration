Q: Katina has $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $100 from the account every month, how much money will be remaining within the account after 2 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Katina has $3000 in her savings account, and she's going to remove $100 every month. I need to figure out how much money will be left after 2 years. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should figure out how many months are in 2 years. I know that 1 year has 12 months, so 2 years would be 2 times 12, which is 24 months. So, Katina is going to remove money for 24 months.

Next, she removes $100 each month. To find out the total amount she'll remove over 24 months, I can multiply $100 by 24. Let me do that calculation: 100 times 24. Hmm, 100 times 20 is 2,200, and 100 times 2 is 200, so adding those together, 2,200 plus 200 is 2,400. Wait, that seems right. So, she'll remove a total of $2,400 over 2 years.

Now, Katina started with $3,000. If she removes $2,400, I need to subtract that from the initial amount to find out how much is left. So, 3,000 minus 2,400. Let me do that subtraction. 3,000 minus 2,400. Hmm, 3,000 minus 2,000 is 1,000, and then minus 400 more is 1,000 minus 400 is 600, and then minus 00 is 600. Wait, that seems right. So, 3,000 minus 2,400 is 600.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 24 months times $100 is $2,400. Subtracting that from $3,000 gives $600. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as each month she's taking out $100, so after 12 months, she would have taken out $200, leaving her with $2,800. After 24 months, that would be 2 times $200, which is $400 taken out, so $3,000 minus $400 is $2,600. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
