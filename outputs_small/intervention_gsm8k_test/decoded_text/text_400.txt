Q: A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.  John drinks 2 glasses of milk.  If milk has 3 calories per ounce how many calories did he consume?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total amount of milk John consumed by multiplying the number of glasses by the ounces per glass.

John drank 2 glasses, each containing 8 ounces, so the total milk consumed is 2 multiplied by 8 ounces, which equals 16 ounces.

Next, calculate the total calories by multiplying the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce.

Each ounce of milk has 3 calories, so 16 ounces multiplied by 3 calories per ounce equals 48 calories.

Therefore, John consumed a total of 48 calories from drinking the milk.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total amount of milk John consumed:**
   
   - **Number of glasses:** 2
   - **Ounces per glass:** 8 ounces
   
   \[
   \text{Total milk} = 2 \text{ glasses} \times 8 \text{ ounces/glass} = 16 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total calories consumed:**
   
   - **Calories per ounce of milk:** 3 calories
   - **Total calories:** 
   
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{48}
\]
