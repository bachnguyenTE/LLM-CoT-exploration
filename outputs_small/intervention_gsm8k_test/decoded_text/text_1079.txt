Q: A $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Rogers and his watch. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the watch originally costs $2000. Then, it was put on sale, and Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. Hmm, okay, so 75% off means he paid 25% of the original price, right? Let me write that down.

Original price = $2000  
Sale price for Mr. Rogers = 75% of original price  
So, that would be 0.75 * 2000. Let me calculate that. 0.75 times 2000. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so 3/4 of 2000. Let me do 2000 divided by 4 first, which is 550, and then multiply by 3, which is 1650. So, Mr. Rogers bought it for $1650. Okay, that seems right.

Now, he sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it. So, he sold it for 120% of $1650. Let me figure out what that is. 120% is the same as 1.20 in decimal form. So, 1.20 * 1650. Let me compute that. 

First, 1.20 * 1000 is 1200, and 1.20 * 650 is... let me break it down. 1.20 * 600 is 792, and 1.20 * 50 is 60. So, adding those together: 792 + 60 = 852. So, 1.20 * 1650 is 1200 + 852 = 2052. So, he sold it for $2252? Wait, that seems right. Let me check my math again.

Wait, that seems right. 1.20 times 1650. Alternatively, 1650 * 1.20. 1650 * 1 is 1650, 1650 * 0.20 is 330, so 1650 + 330 is 1980. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
