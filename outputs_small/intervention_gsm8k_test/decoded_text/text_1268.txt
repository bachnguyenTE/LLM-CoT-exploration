Q: A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a tower made out of blocks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says: A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. If there are 32 blocks in the tower in total, how many red blocks are there?

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know the total number of blocks is 32. The tower is made up of blue, yellow, and red blocks. They tell me there are 4 blue blocks. Then, the number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks. And the number of red blocks is unknown, so I need to find that.

Let me write down what I know:

- Number of blue blocks = 4
- Number of yellow blocks = 2 × (number of blue blocks)
- Number of red blocks = unknown (let's call it R)
- Total blocks = 32

So, if I can express the number of yellow and red blocks in terms of the blue blocks, I can add them all up and set the equation equal to 32. That should help me find R.

First, let's find the number of yellow blocks. Since it's twice the number of blue blocks, and blue blocks are 4, then yellow blocks would be 2 × 4. Let me calculate that: 2 × 4 is 8. So, there are 8 yellow blocks.

Now, I know the total number of blocks is 32, and I already have 4 blue and 8 yellow. So, the remaining blocks must be red. So, if I subtract the blue and yellow blocks from the total, I should get the number of red blocks.

Let me write that as an equation:

Total blocks = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks

So, 32 = 4 + 8 + R

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute 4 + 8 first. 4 plus 8 is 12. So, 32 = 12 + R.

To find R, I can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. So, R = 32 - 12.

Calculating that, 32 minus 12 is 20. So, R is 20.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Number of blue blocks: 4. That's given.
2. Number of yellow blocks: twice the number of blue blocks. So, 2 × 4 = 8. That makes sense.
3. Total blocks: 32. So, if I add blue and yellow, that's 4 + 8 = 12.
4. Subtracting that from the total gives me the red blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the number of red blocks is 20.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total number of blocks is the sum of blue, yellow, and red. So, 4 + 8 + R = 32. So, 12 + R = 32. Therefore, R = 32 -12 = 20. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ratios or something else, but, that seems right. Since the problem is straightforward, I think 20 is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just visualize the tower. 4 blue, 8 yellow, and 20 red. So, 4 + 8 is 12, and 12 +20 is 32. Perfect, that adds up.

So, I think I'm confident that the number of red blocks is 20.

**Final Answer**
The number of red blocks is \boxed{20}.
</think>

The tower is made up of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. The total number of blocks is 32.

1. Number of blue blocks = 4
2. Number of yellow blocks = 2 × (number of blue blocks) = 2 × 4 = 8
3. Total blocks = 32

To find the number of red blocks, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total:

\[
32 = 4 + 8 + R
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
32 = 12 + R
\]

Solving for \( R \):

\[
R = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of red blocks is
