Q: Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?

Okay, so Shawnda is trying to make some money by inflating bikes for her neighborhood kids. She charges based on the number of tires each person has. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, on the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated. So, each of these 5 people has a bicycle, which has 2 tires. So, for each person, she needs to inflate 2 tires. That means for each person, she makes 2 * $0.25. Let me calculate that. 2 * 0.25 is 0.50, so each person makes 50 cents. Since there are 5 people, that would be 5 * 0.50. Let me do that multiplication: 5 * 0.50 is 2.50. So, 5 people make 2.50 dollars together.

Next, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Tricycles have 3 tires each. So, for each of these 3 people, she needs to inflate 3 tires. That would be 3 * $0.25 per tire. Let me compute that: 3 * 0.25 is 0.75. So, each person makes 75 cents. With 3 people, that's 3 * 0.75. Let me calculate that: 3 * 0.75 is 2.25. So, 3 people make 2.25 dollars together.

Then, finally, one person came by on a unicycle. Unicycles have only 1 tire. So, she needs to inflate just 1 tire. That would be 1 * $0.25, which is 0.25. So, that person makes 25 cents.

Now, let me add up all the money she made from each group. First, 5 people gave 2.50 dollars. Then, 3 people gave 2.25 dollars. Then, 1 person gave 0.250 dollars. So, adding them together: 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25.

Let me do that step by step. 2.50 + 2.25 is 4.75. Then, 4.75 + 0.25 is 4.99. Wait, that seems right. So, altogether, she made 4.99 dollars that day.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First group: 5 people, each inflating 2 tires. 5 * 2 = 10 tires. Each tire is 0.25, so 10 * 0.25 is 2.50. That's correct.

Second group: 3 people, each inflating 3 tires. 3 * 3 = 9 tires. 9 * 0.25 is 2.25. That's correct.

Third group: 1 person, inflating 1 tire. 1 * 0.25 is 0.25. Correct.

Adding them up: 2.50 + 2.25 is 4.75, plus 0.25 is 4.99. So, that's 4.99 dollars.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount she made that day is 4.99 dollars. Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of each person's contribution and then sum them up.

First group: 5 people, each inflating 2 tires. So, 5 * 2 = 10 tires. 10 * 0.25 = 2.50.

Second group: 3 people, each inflating 3 tires. 3 * 3 = 9 tires. 9 * 0.25 = 2.25.

Third group: 1 person, inflating 1 tire. 1 * 0.25 = 0.25.

Total: 2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 4.99.

Yes, that's the same as before. So, 4.99 dollars.

Wait, that seems right. So, 4.99 is the total amount she made that day.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 4.99 dollars.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
 Shawnda made a total
