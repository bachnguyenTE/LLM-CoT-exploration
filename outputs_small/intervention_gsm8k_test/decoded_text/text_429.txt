Q: Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. How many letters are in Indras and her sister's names?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of letters in Indras's name, which is given as 6 letters.

Next, I calculate half of Indras's name: 6 divided by 2 equals 3.

Then, I add 4 more letters to this half to find the number of letters in her sister's name: 3 plus 4 equals 7.

Finally, I add the number of letters in both names together to get the total: 6 plus 7 equals 13.
