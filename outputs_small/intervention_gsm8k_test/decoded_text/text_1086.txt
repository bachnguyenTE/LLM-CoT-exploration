Q: Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Okay, so Marcel runs a bicycle store and he has three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. I need to figure out how much money Marcel earned in a month based on the sales. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the prices of each bike:
- MTB is $500
- BMX is half the price of an MTB, so that would be $250
- Trekking is $450

Next, the total number of bikes sold in the month is 300. So, 300 bikes in total.

Now, the problem says that half of them were Trekking bikes. Hmm, half of 300 is... let me calculate that. Half of 300 is 150. So, 150 Trekking bikes were sold.

Then, it mentions that 15% were BMX bikes. Okay, so 15% of 300 bikes. Let me compute that. 15% of 300 is 0.15 * 300. Let me do that multiplication: 0.15 * 300. Well, 0.15 * 300 is 45, so 45 bikes. So, 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, total bikes sold are 300, and we have 150 Trekking and 45 BMX. So, the remaining bikes are MTB. Let me subtract the other two from the total to find the number of MTB bikes.

So, 300 - 150 -45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Let me double-check that: 150 +45 is 195, and 300 -195 is 105. Yep, that's correct.

Now, to find out how much money Marcel earned, I need to calculate the total revenue from each type of bike and then add them up.

MTB revenue: 105 bikes * $500 each. Let me compute that. 100 bikes would be $50,000, and 5 bikes would be $250, so total is $52,500.

BMX revenue: 45 bikes * $250 each. Let me calculate that. 40 bikes would be $10,000, and 5 bikes would be $1,250, so total is $11,250.

Trekking revenue: 150 bikes * $450 each. Hmm, 100 bikes would be $45,000, 50 bikes would be $22,500, so total is $67,500.

Now, adding all these together: $52,500 (MTB) + $11,250 (BMX) + $67,500 (Trekking). Let me add them step by step.

First, MTB and BMX: $52,500 + $11,250 = $53,750.

Then, add the Trekking revenue: $53,750 + $67,500 = $121,250.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify the calculations again.

MTB: 105 * 500. 105 * 500. 105 * 500. Let me compute 100 * 550 = 55,000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 100 * 500 is 50,000, 100 * 50 is 5,500, so 50,000 + 5,500 is 55,500. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
