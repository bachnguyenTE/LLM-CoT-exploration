Q: In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about rabbits, dogs, and cats in a neighborhood. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. It says: "In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood?" 

Alright, so we have rabbits, dogs, and cats. The number of rabbits is related to the number of dogs and cats. Specifically, rabbits are twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, if I let R be the number of rabbits, then R = (number of dogs + number of cats) - 12. 

Next, it says there are two cats for every dog. So, the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1. That means for every dog, there are two cats. So, if the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats must be 2 times 60, right? Let me write that down.

Number of dogs = 60
Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 126

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 cats for each dog, so 2 times 60 is 126 cats. So, total number of cats and dogs is 66 + 126. Let me calculate that. 66 + 126 is 192. So, the combined number of cats and dogs is 192.

Now, the number of rabbits is twelve less than that. So, rabbits = 192 - 12. Let me compute that. 192 minus 12 is 180. So, the number of rabbits is 180.

So, now, the question is asking for the total number of pets in the neighborhood. So, that would be rabbits plus dogs plus cats. Let me add them up.

Number of rabbits = 180
Number of dogs = 66
Number of cats = 126

Total pets = 180 + 66 + 126. Let me compute that step by step. 180 + 66 is 246, and then 246 + 126 is 372. So, the total number of pets is 372.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, number of dogs is 66. Number of cats is two times that, so 126. So, 66 + 126 is 192. Then, rabbits are 12 less than that, so 192 -12 is 180. Then, adding all together: 180 + 66 is 246, plus 126 is 372. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the number of cats is two times the number of dogs, which is 66, so 126. So, 66 + 126 is 192. Then, rabbits are 12 less than that, so 180. So, 180 + 66 +126 is 372. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of pets is 372. So, the answer is 372.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using variables.

Let me denote the number of dogs as D, cats as C, and rabbits as R.

Given that D = 66.

Given that C = 2D, so C = 2*66 = 126.

Then, R = (D + C) -12 = (66 + 126) -12 = 192 -12 = 180.

So, total pets = R + D + C = 180 +66 +126 = 372.

Same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as total pets being R + D + C, and R is 12 less than D + C. So, R = (D + C) -12. So, total pets = (D + C -12) + D + C = 2D + 2C -12. But, that seems
