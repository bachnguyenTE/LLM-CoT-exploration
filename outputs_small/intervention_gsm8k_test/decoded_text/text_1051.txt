Q: Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  If there are 16 cups in a gallon, how many gallons of water does she drink in 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days by multiplying her daily consumption by 30.

Next, convert the total cups into gallons by dividing by the number of cups in a gallon.

Finally, present the answer in gallons.

To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days:**

   \[
   \text{Total cups} = \text{Cups per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups}
   \]

2. **Convert the total cups into gallons:**

   Since there are 16 cups in a gallon,

   \[
   \text{Gallons} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per gallon}} = \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15.25 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Express the final answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{15.75 \, \text{gallons}}
   \]

**Note:** The exact calculation shows that Ingrid drinks **15.75 gallons** of water in 30 days.
