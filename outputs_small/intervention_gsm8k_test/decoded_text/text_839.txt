Q: A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. Since he has 3 cows, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total milk production per day with the current 3 cows by multiplying the milk per cow by the number of cows.

Next, calculate the total milk needed for 25 liters per day by multiplying the desired daily milk by the number of days (assuming 1 day).

Then, find the difference between the total milk needed and the current production to determine how much additional milk is required.

Finally, divide the additional milk needed by the milk production per cow to find out how many more cows are required.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Current Production:**
   - **Number of cows:** 3
   - **Milk produced per cow per day:** 5 liters
   - **Total milk produced per day:** \( 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters} \)

2. **Desired Production:**
   - **Desired milk production per day:** 25 liters

3. **Additional Milk Needed:**
   - **Additional milk required:** \( 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \)

4. **Number of Additional Cows Required:**
   - **Milk produced per additional cow per day:** 5 liters
   - **Number of additional cows needed:** \( \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{2}
