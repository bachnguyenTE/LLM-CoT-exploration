Q: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Grade 5 students, and I need to figure out how many girls are not in the girl scout. Let me read it again: There are 200 Grade 5 students in total, 2/5 are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. I need to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the total number of students is 200. Wait, that seems right. So, 200 students in total. Now, 2/5 of them are boys. So, I need to find out how many boys there are and how many girls there are. Since 2/5 are boys, the remaining must be girls. Let me calculate the number of boys first.

To find the number of boys, I can multiply the total number of students by 2/5. So, 200 multiplied by 2/5. Let me write that down: 200 * (2/5). Hmm, 200 divided by 5 is 40, right? Because 5 times 40 is 200. So, 200 divided by 5 is 40. Then, multiplying that by 2 gives me 80. So, there are 80 boys in Grade 5.

Now, since the total number of students is 200, and there are 80 boys, the number of girls must be 200 minus 80. Let me do that subtraction: 200 - 80. That equals 120. So, there are 120 girls in Grade 5.

Alright, now the problem says that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, I need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout. To do that, I can take the number of girls, which is 120, and multiply it by 2/3. Let me write that: 120 * (2/3). Hmm, 120 divided by 3 is 40, because 3 times 40 is 120. Then, multiplying that by 2 gives me 80. So, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, which is 80 girls.

But, that seems right. So, 80 girls are in the girl scout. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of girls is 120, and 80 are in the girl scout, so the number of girls not in the girl scout would be 120 minus 80. Let me calculate that: 120 - 80 is 40. So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, total students: 200. 2/5 are boys. 200 divided by 5 is 40, times 2 is 80. So, 80 boys. 200 minus 80 is 120 girls. 2/3 of 120 is 80. 120 minus 80 is 40. So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 40 girls not in the girl scout. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to confirm.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. If 2/5 are boys, then 3/5 are girls. So, 3/5 of 200 is 120 girls. Then, 2/3 of those 120 girls are in the girl scout. So, 2/3 of 120 is 80. So, 120 minus 80 is 40. So, same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the fraction of girls not in the girl scout. So, if 2/3 are in the girl scout, then 1 - 2/3 is 1/3 are not in the girl scout. So, 1/3 of 120 is 40. So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout. So, same answer.

So, that seems consistent. So, I think 40 is the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout
