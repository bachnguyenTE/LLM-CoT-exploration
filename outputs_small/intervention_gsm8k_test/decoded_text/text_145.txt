Q: John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest within a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about John and his pineapple field. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Then it mentions there are 100 pineapples per hectare. So, I guess that's the yield per hectare. John can harvest every 3 months. The question is asking how many pineapples he can harvest within a year.

Alright, let me break this down. I need to find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year. He has 10 hectares, each producing 100 pineapples. So, first, maybe I should calculate the total number of pineapples per year without considering the harvesting frequency.

So, if there are 100 pineapples per hectare, and he has 10 hectares, that should be 100 multiplied by 10. Let me write that out: 100 * 10 = 1200. So, 1200 pineapples per year. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 100 times 10 is 1200. Yeah, that makes sense.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 1200 pineapples per year. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if he can harvest every 3 months, how many times does he harvest in a year?

Well, a year is 12 months. If he harvests every 3 months, that means he harvests 12 divided by 3, which is 4 times a year. So, 4 harvests in a year.

So, if he harvests 1200 pineapples each year, and he does this 4 times, then the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 1200 * 4. Let me calculate that: 1200 * 4. Hmm, 1200 times 4 is 4800. So, 4800 pineapples.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 10 hectares times 100 pineapples per hectare is 1000 pineapples per year. Wait, that seems right. 1000 per year. But, that seems right.
