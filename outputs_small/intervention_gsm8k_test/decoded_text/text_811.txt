Q: Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?

Okay, so Felix noticed that kids are stuck in trees, and he wants to charge them for getting their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every time he climbs up a branch, it costs him $0.25. During the week, he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I need to understand the problem. Felix charges kids based on the height of the branches he has to climb. Each branch costs $0.25. So, if he climbs up a branch, he gets paid $0.25. 

He made a total of $105 during the week. I need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. So, first, I should figure out the total number of branches he climbed during the week, and then divide that by the number of days in the week to get the average per day.

Wait, that seems right. So, if he made $105, and each branch is $0.25, then the total number of branches he climbed is the total money he made divided by the cost per branch. So, that would be 105 divided by 0.25. Let me write that down.

Total money made: $105.00
Cost per branch: $0.25
Total branches climbed = Total money / Cost per branch
So, 105 / 0.25

Hmm, 105 divided by 0.25. I know that dividing by 0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4, because 1 divided by 0.25 is 4. So, 105 times 4 is 420. So, he climbed 420 branches during the week.

Now, assuming the week has 7 days, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, I need to divide the total branches by 7.

So, 420 branches / 7 days.

Let me calculate that. 420 divided by 7. 7 goes into 42 six times, so 6. Then, 7 goes into 0 zero times, and 7 goes into 0 zero times. So, 60. So, 60 branches per day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 105 divided by 0.25. 0.25 is a quarter, so 105 divided by a quarter is the same as 105 multiplied by 4, which is 420. That's correct.

Then, 420 divided by 7. 7 times 60 is 420, so that's correct. So, 60 branches per day.

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe in case I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Alternatively, I can think of it as how many branches does Felix need to climb to make $105. Since each branch is $0.25, the number of branches is 105 / 0.25, which is 420. Then, 420 branches over 7 days is 60 branches per day. Yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I think in terms of units, $105 divided by $0.25 per branch is 420 branches. Then, 420 branches over 7 days is 60 branches per day. So, same result.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 60 branches per day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any chance I misread the question. It says "on average, how many branches did he climb per day?" So, yes, 60 branches per day.

Alternatively, if the week is 7 days, 420 branches over 7 days is 60 branches per day. So, 60 is the correct average.

I think that's it. So, the answer is 60 branches per day.

**Final Answer**
Felix climbed an average of \boxed{60} branches per day.

Felix noticed that kids in the neighborhood are getting things stuck in trees and decided to charge them based on how high he had to climb. Each branch he climbed costs $0.25. During the week, he made $105. To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:
   \[
