Q: Peyton scheduled after-work activities of a one hour yoga class on Monday, a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga on Tuesday, a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday, a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday, and two hours of errands on Friday. How many hours will all Peyton’s after-work activities take?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours all of Peyton's after-work activities take. Let me break this down step by step because it seems like a series of different activities with varying durations. 

First, the problem says she scheduled a one-hour yoga class on Monday. That's straightforward. So, Monday's yoga is 1 hour.

Next, it mentions a cooking class that lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga. Hmm, so if Monday's yoga is 1 hour, then the cooking class should be 3 times that. Let me write that down: Cooking class = 3 * Monday's yoga time. So, 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours. Got it, so the cooking class is 3 hours long.

Then, there's a half-hour cheese-tasting event on Wednesday. Half an hour is 0.5 hours. So, Wednesday's event is 0.5 hours.

Moving on to Thursday, there's a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Thursday. Wait, that seems right. So, the museum tour is half the duration of the cooking class. But, that seems right. So, if the cooking class is 3 hours, then the museum tour is half of that. Let me calculate that: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours. So, the museum tour is 1.5 hours.

Finally, on Friday, she has two hours of errands to do. That's straightforward, so Friday is 2 hours.

Now, let me list out all the activities and their durations:

- Monday: 1 hour yoga
- Tuesday: Cooking class = 3 hours
- Wednesday: Cheese-tasting = 0.5 hours
- Thursday: Museum tour = 1.5 hours
- Friday: Errands = 2 hours

Now, to find the total time, I need to add all these durations together. Let me write that out:

Total time = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday

Plugging in the numbers:

Total time = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2

Let me add them step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

First, 1 + 3 = 4

Then, 4 + 0.5 = 4.5

Next, 4.5 + 1.5 = 6

Finally, 6 + 2 = 8

So, adding all these together, the total time is 8 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Monday: 1 hour. That's clear.

Cooking class: 3 times Monday's yoga. 3 *1 =3. Correct.

Wednesday: Half-hour, which is 0.5. Correct.

Thursday: Museum tour is half as long as the cooking class. Cooking class is 3, so half is 1.5. Correct.

Friday: 2 hours. Correct.

Adding them up: 1 +3 is 4, plus 0.5 is 4.5, plus 1.5 is 6, plus 2 is 8. Yep, that adds up.

So, all in all, all of Peyton's after-work activities take a total of 8 hours.

**Final Answer**
The total time for all of Peyton’s after-work activities is \boxed{8} hours.

Peyton scheduled several after-work activities, each with a specific duration. Here are the steps to find the total time:

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Cooking class**: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, which is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half as long as the cooking class, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Adding all these durations together:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8
\]

Thus, the total time for all of Peyton’s after-work activities is \(\boxed{8}\) hours.
