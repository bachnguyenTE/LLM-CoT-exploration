Q: The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. If the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, how many women have remained on the bus?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the ratio of men to women on a bus. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says the ratio of men to women is 5:9. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, for every 5 men, there are 9 women. I think I can use this ratio to find out how many men and women are on the bus initially.

The total number of passengers is 84. So, if I can find the number of men and women based on the ratio, I can add them up and make sure it equals 84. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier. That way, the ratio remains 5:9. So, total passengers would be 5x + 9x, which is 14x. And we know that 14x equals 84. So, I can solve for x.

14x = 84  
Divide both sides by 14:  
x = 84 / 14  
x = 6

Okay, so x is 6. That means the number of men is 5x, which is 5*6=30, and the number of women is 9x, which is 9*6=54. Let me check that: 30 + 54 = 84. Yep, that adds up. So, initially, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus.

Now, the problem says that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. So, we need to find out how many women are left on the bus. Initially, there were 54 women, and 20 leave. So, subtract 20 from 54.

54 - 20 = 34

Wait, that seems right. So, 34 women remain on the bus. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 54 women minus 20 is 34. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 34 women remain on the bus.

But, that seems right. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors.

1. The ratio of men to women is 5:9. So, I set men as 5x and women as 9x.
2. Total passengers: 5x + 9x = 14x = 84. So, x = 6.
3. Therefore, women initially: 9x = 54.
4. After 20 women alight: 54 - 20 = 34.

Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

**Final Answer**
The number of women remaining on the bus is \boxed{34}.

The ratio of men to women on a bus is 5:9. Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Thus, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

Next, 20 women alight from the bus. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

The number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\).
