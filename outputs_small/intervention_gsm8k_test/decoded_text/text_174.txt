Q: Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total time Billy will spend peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

Since each potato takes 1.5 minutes to peel and 5 seconds to cut, I'll calculate the time for each potato.

Converting 5 seconds to minutes: 5 seconds ÷ 60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Adding the peeling and cutting times: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 2.5833 minutes per potato.

Finally, multiplying by the total number of potatoes: 60 potatoes × 2.5833 minutes = 168 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 168 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Total Potatoes:** 60
- **Time to Peel Each Potato:** 1.5 minutes
- **Time to Cut Each Potato:** 5 seconds

### **Step 1: Convert All Times to the Same Unit**

To make calculations easier, let's convert all times to minutes.

- **Peeling Time:** 1.5 minutes (already in minutes)
- **Cutting Time:** 5 seconds = \( \frac{5}{60} \) minutes ≈ 0.0833 minutes

### **Step 2: Calculate Time per Potato**

For each potato, the total time is the sum of peeling and cutting times.

\[
\text{Time per Potato} = 1.5\ \text{minutes} + 0.0833\ \text{minutes} = 2.5833\ \text{minutes}
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Time for All Potatoes**

Multiply the time per potato by the total number of potatoes.

\[
\text{Total Time} = 60\ \text{potatoes} \times 2.5833\ \text{minutes/pot potato} = 168\ \text{minutes}
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{168\ \text{ minutes}}
\]
