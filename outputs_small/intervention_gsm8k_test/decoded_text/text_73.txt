Q: Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each for a 3-month installment. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit. How much will Shiela pay each month for 3 months?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150, and she's paying them for over a 3-month period with a 2% interest charge. I need to figure out how much she'll pay each month. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without any interest. Each phone is $150, so five of them would be 5 multiplied by 150. Let me write that out: 5 * 150. Hmm, 5 times 100 is 500, and 5 times 50 is 250, so adding those together gives 500 + 250 = 800. Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost is $880.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check: 150 * 5. 100 *5 is 500, and 50 *5 is 250, so 500 + 250 is indeed 800. Okay, so the total cost is $880.

Now, she's getting these five phones for a 3-month installment. So, she's paying them over three months. But, that seems right. So, the total amount she needs to pay is $880, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount is $880.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount is $880. Now, she's getting this over a 3-month period, so that's 3 months. But, that seems right. So, she's paying it over 3 months.

But, that seems right. So, the next part is that a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. So, each phone is $150, so 2% of 150 is the interest per phone. So, I need to calculate the interest per phone first.

So, 2% of 150. Let me compute that. 2% is 0.02 in decimal. So, 150 * 0.02. Hmm, 150 *0.02 is 30, and 0.02 *0.02 is 0.004, so total is 30.0004, which is $3.004. So, approximately $3.004 per phone.

But, that seems right. So, 2% of 150 is 3.004, so about $3.0004 per phone.

But, that seems right. So, for each phone, the interest is approximately $3.004.

But, that seems right. So, for five phones, the total interest would be 5 times 3.004, which is 15.02. So, approximately $15.02 in total interest.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 * 3.004 is 15.02. So, total interest is $15.02.

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the principal plus the interest, which is 880 + 15.02, which is 895.02. So, approximately $895.02.

But, that seems right. So, the total amount to be paid is $895.02.

But, that seems right. So, now, she's paying this over 3 months. So, the question is, how much will she pay each month?

So, total amount is $895.02, over 3 months. So, we can divide that by 3 to get the monthly payment.

So, 895.02 divided by 3. Let me compute that.

First, 3 goes into 8 two times, 2*3 is 6, subtract 6 from 8, remainder 2. Bring down the 9, making 29. 3 goes into 29 nine times, 9*3 is 27, subtract 27 from 29, remainder 2. Bring down the 5, making 25. 3 goes into 25 eight times, 8*3 is 24, subtract 24 from 25, remainder 1. Bring down the 0, making 10. 3 goes into 10 three times, 3*3 is 9, subtract 9 from 10, remainder 1. Bring down the 2, making 12
