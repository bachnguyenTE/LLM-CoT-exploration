Q: Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. I need to find out how many books Fawn has. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably assign variables to each person's number of books to make it easier to work with. Let me call the number of books Fawn has "F". Then, since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne must have F - 12 books. That makes sense because if Fawn has more, Anne has less by 12.

Now, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Since Anne has F - 12 books, Sofie must have (F - 12) + 25 books. Let me write that down: Sofie = F - 12 + 25. Simplifying that, F -12 +25 is F -7. So, Sofie has F -7 books.

Alright, so now I have expressions for each person's number of books in terms of F. Let me write them all out:

- Fawn: F books
- Anne: F - 12 books
- Sofie: F -7 books

Now, the total number of books they have together is 85. So, if I add up all their books, it should equal 85. That gives me the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 7) = 85

Let me simplify this equation step by step. First, I'll remove the parentheses:

F + F - 12 + F -7 = 85

Now, combine like terms. There are three F terms: F + F + F, which is 3F. Then, the constants are -12 and -7. Adding those together: -12 -7 is -19.

So, the equation simplifies to:

3F - 19 = 85

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check:

F + (F -12) + (F -7) = 85

Yes, that's F + F -12 + F -7. So, 3F -19 =85. Wait, that seems right. 85 is on the right side, so 3F -19 =85.

Now, I need to solve for F. Let me add 19 to both sides to get rid of the -19 on the left.

3F -19 +19 =85 +19

Which simplifies to:

3F = 104

Okay, so 3F =104. Now, to find F, I need to divide both sides by 3.

F =104 /3

Hmm, let me compute that. 104 divided by 3. 3 goes into 10 three times (3*3=9), remainder 1. Bring down the 4, making it 14. 3 goes into 14 four times (3*4=12), remainder 2. So, 104 divided by 3 is 34 with a remainder of 2. So, 104/3 is 34 and 2/3.

Wait, that seems right. So, Fawn has 34 and two-thirds books? That doesn't seem like a whole number. Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go back through the steps.

We had:

F + (F -12) + (F -7) =85

Which is 3F -19=85

Then, 3F=85+19=104

So, F=104/3=34.666..., which is 34 and 2/3.

Hmm, so that's correct. So, Fawn has 34 and two-thirds books. But, that seems right. Maybe the problem allows for fractions? The problem doesn't specify that the number of books has to be a whole number, so that's okay.

But, that seems right. Let me just verify by plugging the numbers back into the original problem.

If Fawn has 34 and two-thirds books, then Anne has 12 fewer, so that's 34 and two-thirds minus 12, which is 22 and two-thirds.

Then, Sofie has 25 more than Anne, so that's 22 and two-thirds plus 25, which is 47 and two-thirds.

Now, let's add them up
