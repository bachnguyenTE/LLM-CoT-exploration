Q: Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Jerome and his friends coming to visit. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that there are 4 friends who came to visit. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. Hmm, okay, so that's straightforward. So, Friend 1 pressed 20 times.

Then, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Hmm, so I need to calculate 1/4 more than 20. Let me write that down. If the first friend pressed 20 times, then 1/4 of that is 20 divided by 4, which is 5. So, 1/4 more would be 20 + 5, which is 27. So, Friend 2 pressed 27 times.

Next, the third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Wait, that seems right. So, Friend 4 pressed 60 times, as given. So, Friend 3 pressed 10 times more than that. So, 60 +10 is 70. So, Friend 3 pressed 70 times.

Wait, that seems right. So, Friend 1:20, Friend 2:27, Friend 3:70, Friend 4:60. So, now, to find the total number of doorbell rings, I need to add all these up.

Let me add them step by step. So, Friend 1 is 20, Friend 2 is 27. 22 +27 is 49. Then, Friend 3 is 70. So, 49 +70 is 119. Then, Friend 4 is 60. So, 119 +60 is 179.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. So, Friend 1:20, Friend 2:20 +5=25? Wait, that seems right. 20 +5 is 25, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
