Q: Mulan has $40. Her father gave her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. How much money does Mulan have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money Mulan has after receiving her father's gift. She initially has $40 and receives an additional $100, so her total becomes $144.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which amounts to $60, and a bag for $20. Adding these together, the total expenditure is $82.

Finally, to find out how much money she has left, I'll subtract the total cost of the items from her total amount of money. This means subtracting $82 from $144, leaving her with $62.

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Mulan starts with **\$40**.

2. **Father's Gift:**
   - Her father gives her **\$100**.
   - **Total Money After Gift:** \$40 + \$100 = **\$144**

3. **Cost of Purchases:**
   - **Two pairs of jeans:** \$30 each × 2 = **\$60**
   - **Bag:** \$20
   - **Total Expenditure:** \$60 + \$20 = **\$82**

4. **Money Left:**
   - **Total Money After Purchases:** \$144 - \$82 = **\$62**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{62}
