Q: Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Courtney said there were 48 people at a concert, but, that seems right. Then Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%. Hmm, so Kelly is correct, right? So I need to figure out how many people actually attended the concert.

Let me think. If Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, that means that 48 is 20% more than the actual number. So, in other words, 48 is 120% of the real attendance. Because 100% would be the actual number, and 20% more would make it 120%.

So, if I let x be the actual number of people, then 120% of x is equal to 48. So, mathematically, that would be 1.20x = 48. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 1.20.

Let me write that down:

1.20x = 48

So, x = 48 / 1.20

Hmm, let me compute that. 48 divided by 1.20. Well, 1.20 is the same as 120/100, so dividing by 1.20 is the same as multiplying by 100/120. So, 48 * (100/120). Let me compute that.

First, 48 divided by 120. Let me see, 48 divided by 120 is 0.4. Then, 0.4 multiplied by 100 is 40. So, x is 40.

Wait, that seems right. So, the actual number of people is 40. Let me check that.

If the actual number is 40, then 20% of 40 is 8. So, 40 +8 is 48. So, that's exactly what Courtney said. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, Kelly was correct, so the real number is 40.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 40.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

If the actual number is x, then 1.20x = 48. So, x = 48 /1.20. 48 divided by 1.20. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, 48 divided by 1.20. Let me do this division step by step.

1.20 goes into 48 how many times?

1.20 times 40 is 48, because 1.20 times 10 is 12, so 1.20 times 40 is 48. So, 1.20 times 40 is 48, so 48 divided by 1.20 is 40.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the actual number is 40.

So, the answer is 40.

Wait, that seems right. So, the real number is 40.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The real number of people who attended the concert is \boxed{40}.

Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number, but, that seems right. Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, meaning 48 is 120% of the actual number. Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. Then, we have:

\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Calculating this, we get:

\[ x = 40 \]

Thus, the real number of people who attended the concert is \boxed{40}.
