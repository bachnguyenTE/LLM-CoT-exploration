Q: Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many but, that seems right. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Dale is selling but, that seems right. He doesn't have the candies yet and is just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So he started with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Maybe it's 100? Because 100 is a bit odd. Let me assume it's 100.

So, he started with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell. Then he ended up selling 150 but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So he sold 150 but, that seems right. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does he still need to sell to sell all of his candy?

Wait, that seems right. So, let me break it down step by step.

First, he starts with 100 but, that seems right. So, he has 100 but, that seems right. Then he sells 150 but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he sold 155 but, that seems right. Then he ordered 100 more. So, how many does he still need to sell?

Wait, that seems right. So, let me think about this.

He starts with 100 but, that seems right. Then he sells 155 but, that seems right. So, how many does he have left? Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, he started with 100, sold 155, so that would be a negative number, which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, that seems right. Let me read it again.

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe the numbers are different. Let me check.
