Q: 90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.  Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off.  If he buys 2 boxes of contact, how much will each pair of contacts cost?

Okay, so I have this problem here about contacts and boxes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that 90 single use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days. Each box is $100.00 and currently 10% off. If he buys 2 boxes of contacts, how much will each pair of contacts cost?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. 

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The question is asking for the cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes. So, I need to figure out the total cost for 2 boxes after the discount and then divide that by the number of pairs.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me start by figuring out the total number of contacts in 2 boxes. Since each box has 90 contacts, two boxes would have 90 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down:

Number of contacts per box = 90
Number of boxes = 2
Total contacts = 90 * 2 = 180

So, 180 contacts in total. But, that seems right. 90 times 2 is 180. Okay, so 180 single use contacts.

Now, each box is $100.00 and it's 10% off. So, first, I need to calculate the discounted price per box. Then, multiply that by 2 to get the total cost for 2 boxes. After that, since each pair is two contacts, I can figure out the cost per pair.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me calculate the discounted price per box first.

Original price per box = $100.00
Discount = 10%
So, the discount amount is 10% of $100.00.

Calculating 10% of 100.00: 10% is 0.10, so 100.00 * 0.10 = 10.00.

So, the discount is $11.00. Therefore, the discounted price per box is:

$100.00 - $11.00 = $89.000.

Wait, that seems right. So, each box is now $89.000 after the discount.

Now, if he buys 2 boxes, the total cost would be:

2 * $89.00 = $178.000.

So, the total cost for 2 boxes is $178.000.

Now, the question is asking for the cost per pair of contacts. So, each pair is two contacts. So, how many pairs are in 180 contacts? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
