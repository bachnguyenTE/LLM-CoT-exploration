Q: John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John and DeSean making s'mores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the bag has 35 marshmallows. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean also makes 9 S'mores. Then they drop 3 marshmallows on the ground. I need to find out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Hmm, let me break it down. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, right? So if John makes 9 S'mores, he uses 9 marshmallows. Similarly, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he also uses 9 marshmallows. That means together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

But, that seems right. So, the total number of marshmallows they started with was 35. If they used 18, then the number left in the bag would be 35 - 18. Let me calculate that: 35 minus 18 is 17. So, there are 17 marshmallows left in the bag.

Now, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so that's 3 less. Wait, that seems right. So, the total left is 17, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 17 marshmallows left.

But, that seems right. So, now, how many S'mores can each kid have? So, each S'more is one marshmallow, so the number of S'mores each kid can have is equal to the number of marshmallows they have.

But, that seems right. So, the total marshmallows left is 17. So, if they want to split them equally, each kid can have 17 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 17 divided by 2 is 8.5. Hmm, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, each kid can have 8.5 S'mores? But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8.5 S'mores each.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 8.5? But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8.5 S'mores each.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 8.5? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8.5 S'mores each.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 8.5? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8.5 S'mores each.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8.5 S'mores each. So, that's the answer.
