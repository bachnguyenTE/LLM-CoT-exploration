Q: John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep.  It cost $.1 per cubic foot to fill.  How much does it cost to fill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John is filling a pool, and I need to figure out how much it will cost him. Let me read it again: "John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep. It costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill. How much does it cost to fill?" Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply that by the cost per cubic foot.

First, let me visualize the pool. It's a rectangular pool, right? So, the dimensions given are length, width, and depth. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet, and it's 5 feet deep. So, I think the volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying length, width, and depth. That makes sense because volume is a three-dimensional measurement.

So, let me write that down. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = length × width × depth

Plugging in the numbers, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 5 feet. So, Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft. Let me compute that.

First, 6 multiplied by 4 is 24. Then, 24 multiplied by 5 is 120. So, the volume is 120 cubic feet. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 6 times 4 is 24, 24 times 5 is 120. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot. So, I need to multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot. That would be 120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot. Let me compute that.

120 times 0.1 is 12. So, the total cost is $12.00. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think again: 6 by 4 is 24, times 5 is 120. 120 times 0.1 is 12. Yeah, that's correct. So, the cost is $12.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the multiplication. 6 times 4 is 24, 24 times 5 is 120. 120 times 0.1 is 12. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 120 cubic feet times $0.1 per cubic foot. So, 120 times 0.1 is 12. So, that's $12.00. So, that's $12.

Wait, that seems right. So, the cost is $12.00. So, the answer is $12.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe, but, that seems right. Alternatively, if I had to, I could have converted the feet to inches, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 6 feet is 72 inches, 4 feet is 48 inches, 5 feet is 60 inches. So, 72 times 48 is... Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
