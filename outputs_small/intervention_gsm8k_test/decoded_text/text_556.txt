Q: How much does it cost you for lunch today at Subway if you pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub and thrice as much for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The problem states that the foot-long fish sub costs $40, which is three times the price of the six-inch combo sub.

To find the price of the six-inch sub, I'll divide the price of the foot-long by three.

So, $44 divided by 3 equals approximately $14.67.

Therefore, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs about $14.67.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub at Subway.

1. **Given:**
   - The foot-long fish sub costs \$40.
   - The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long.

2. **Let:**
   - \( C \) = Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   C = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long}
   \]
   \[
   C = 3 \times 40
   \]
   \[
   C = 12
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs \(\boxed{12}\) dollars.
