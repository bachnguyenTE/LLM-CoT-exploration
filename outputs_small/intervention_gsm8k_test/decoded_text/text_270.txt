Q: Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, and the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. How many M&Ms did Mary get total?

Okay, so Mary bought three bags of M&Ms, and I need to figure out how many she got in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes.

First, the problem says the first bag has 300 M&Ms. That's straightforward. So, Bag 1: 300 M&Ms.

Next, the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first. Hmm, so if the first bag is 300, then the second one is 300 plus 12. Let me write that out: 300 + 12. Let me calculate that. 300 plus 10 is 310, and then plus 2 more is 312. Wait, that seems right. So, Bag 2 has 312 M&Ms.

Now, the third bag is a bit trickier because it has a hole, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. The first bag had 300, so half of that would be 300 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 2 is 155. So, Bag 3 has 155 M&Ms.

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, I need to add up the M&Ms from all three bags. So, that would be Bag 1 plus Bag 2 plus Bag 3. Let me write that out: 300 + 312 + 155.

Let me add them step by step. First, 300 plus 312. Let's see, 300 plus 300 would be 600, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 300 plus 312 is 612? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 300 plus 312 is 612. Hmm, okay, so 300 + 312 is 612.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 300 + 300 is 600, and then +12 is 612. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, I need to add the third bag, which is 155, to that total. So, 612 plus 155. Let me do that. 612 plus 100 is 712, plus 50 is 762, plus 5 is 767. So, 612 + 155 is 767.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify: 612 + 155. Let's break it down:

612 + 155:

Start with the units place: 2 + 5 is 7.

Tens place: 1 + 5 is 6.

Hundreds place: 6 + 1 is 7.

So, 767. Yeah, that's correct.

So, adding all three together: 300 + 312 + 155 equals 767.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First bag: 300.

Second bag: 300 +12 = 312.

Third bag: 300 /2 = 155.

Total: 300 + 312 +155.

300 + 312: 300 + 300 is 630, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 300 + 312 is 612.

612 +155: 612 +100 is 712, 712 +50 is 762, 762 +5 is 767.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 767.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I can add them all together in one go.

300 + 312 +155.

Let me add 300 and 312 first: 300 + 312 is 612.

Then, 612 +155: 612 +100 is 712, 712 +50 is 762
