Q: For each small task accomplished, Jairus gets $0.8 while Jenny gets $0.5. If each of them finished 20 tasks, how much more will Jairus get than Jenny?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Jairus and Jenny each do some tasks, and they get money for each task they complete. The question is asking how much more Jairus will get than Jenny if they each finish 20 tasks. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he completes, and Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. Both of them finished 20 tasks each. I need to find the difference in the money they get. So, I think I need to calculate how much each of them gets and then subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total to see how much more Jairus gets.

Let me write down the information:

- Jairus's rate: $0.8 per task
- Jenny's rate: $0.5 per task
- Number of tasks each did: 20

So, for Jairus, the total amount he gets would be the number of tasks multiplied by his rate per task. Similarly, for Jenny, it's the number of tasks multiplied by her rate.

Let me calculate Jairus's total first. So, 20 tasks times $0.8 per task. Hmm, 20 times 0.8. Let me do that multiplication. 20 times 0.8. Well, 20 times 0.8 is the same as 20 multiplied by 8/10, which is 164/10, which is 16.4. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 20 times 0.8. 20 times 0.8 is 16.4. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, Jenny's total. She gets $0.5 per task, so 20 tasks times $0.5. Let me compute that. 20 times 0.5. Hmm, 20 times 0.5 is the same as half of 20, which is 10. So, 20 times 0.5 is 10.00. So, Jenny gets $10.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, Jairus gets $16.40 and Jenny gets $10.00. So, to find how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, I subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total.

So, 16.40 minus 10.00. Let me do that subtraction. 16.40 minus 10.00 is 6.40. So, Jairus gets $6.40 more than Jenny.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Jairus: 20 tasks times $0.8 per task. 20 times 0.8. Let me think of 20 times 0.8 as 20 times 8 divided by 10. 20 times 8 is 160, divided by 10 is 16. So, 16.00. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 times 0.8 is 16.00. So, Jairus gets $16.00.

Jenny: 20 tasks times $0.5 per task. 20 times 0.5 is 10.00. So, that's correct.

Subtracting Jenny's total from Jairus's total: 16.00 minus 10.00 is 6.00. So, $6.00 more.

Wait, that seems right. So, the difference is $6.40 minus $10.00? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
