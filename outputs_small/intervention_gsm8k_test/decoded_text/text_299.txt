Q: John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much John pays for driving each year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, let's understand the problem. John drives to work, which is 30 miles away, and he has to come back each day. So, each day, he drives 30 miles there and 30 miles back. That means each day, he drives a total of 30 * 2 = 60 miles. 

He works 5 days a week, so I should calculate the weekly mileage first. If he drives 60 miles each day, then in a week, he drives 60 * 5. Let me do that multiplication: 60 * 5. Hmm, 60 times 5 is 300. So, he drives 300 miles each week.

Now, he works 50 weeks a year. So, to find the annual mileage, I need to multiply the weekly mileage by the number of weeks. That would be 300 * 50. Let me calculate that. 300 * 50. Hmm, 300 times 50. Let me break it down: 300 * 50 is the same as 300 * 50. 300 * 50 is 16,500. Wait, that seems right. So, 300 * 50 is 16,500 miles per year.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 300 miles per week times 50 weeks is 300 * 50. 300 * 50. 300 * 50 is 16,500. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, he gets charged $2 per mile driven. So, the total cost for driving would be 16,500 miles * $2 per mile. Let me compute that. 16,500 * 2 is 33,000. So, $33,000 for driving.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 16,500 miles times 2 is 33,000. Yeah, that's correct.

Additionally, he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. So, he gets a $150 bonus each month. He works 50 weeks a year, so how many months is that? Wait, that seems right. 50 weeks is approximately 50 / 4.3452 (since 4.3452 weeks is about a month) which is roughly 11.47 months. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 50 weeks is about 11.47 months. So, he gets a $150 bonus each month for 11.47 months. So, total bonus is 150 * 11.47.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that. 150 * 11.47. 150 * 10 is 1,500, and 150 * 1.47 is 220.5. So, total bonus is 1,500 + 220.5 = 1,720.5. So, approximately $1,720.50 per year.

But, that seems right. Alternatively, since 50 weeks is 50 / 4.3452 ≈ 11.47 months, so 11.47 months times $150 per month. So, 11.47 * 150. Let me compute that. 10 * 150 is 1,650, and 1.47 * 150 is 220.5. So, total is 1,650 + 220.5 = 1,870.5. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 11.47 * 150 is 1,720.5. Wait, that seems right. So, the total bonus is $1,720.50.

So, now, the total cost for driving is $33,000, and the total bonus is $1,720.50. So, adding those together, 33,000 + 1,720.50 is 34,720.50.

Wait, that seems right
