Q: Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, and they're all either chickens or cows. The total number of legs is 70. I need to figure out how many of those animals are chickens. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that chickens and cows are the two types of animals here. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, if I can figure out how many chickens and cows there are, I can solve the problem. But, that seems right. Let me write down what I know.

Total number of animals: 20. So, if I let the number of chickens be, say, C, and the number of cows be K, then C + K = 20. That makes sense because each animal is either a chicken or a cow, so adding them together should give the total number of animals.

Now, the total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs, so the total number of legs from chickens would be 2 times the number of chickens, which is 2C. Similarly, cows have 4 legs, so the total number of legs from cows would be 4 times the number of cows, which is 4K. So, adding those together, 2C + 4K should equal 70.

So, now I have two equations:

1. C + K = 20
2. 2C + 4K = 70

Hmm, okay, so I have a system of two equations with two variables. I can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution because it seems straightforward.

From the first equation, I can express C in terms of K. So, C = 20 - K. That way, I can substitute this into the second equation.

Substituting C = 20 - K into the second equation:

2*(20 - K) + 4K = 70

Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply out the 2 into (20 - K):

2*20 = 40
2*(-K) = -2K

So, that gives me 40 - 2K + 4K = 70

Now, combine like terms. The -2K and +4K can be combined:

-2K + 4K = 2K

So, now the equation is:

40 + 2K = 70

Wait, that seems right. So, 40 + 2K = 70.

Now, I need to solve for K. Let me subtract 40 from both sides:

2K = 70 - 40
2K = 30

Then, divide both sides by 2:

K = 15

So, K is 15. That means there are 15 cows. Since the total number of animals is 20, the number of chickens would be 20 - 15 = 5. Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

If there are 15 cows, each with 4 legs, that's 15*4 = 60 legs. And 5 chickens, each with 2 legs, that's 5*2 = 10 legs. So, total legs would be 60 + 10 = 70 legs. That matches the given total. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the number of chickens is 5. So, the answer is 5 chickens.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using elimination instead of substitution. Just to make sure.

So, the two equations are:

1. C + K = 20
2. 2C + 4K = 70

If I multiply the first equation by 2, I get:

2C + 2K = 40

Then, subtract that from the second equation:

(2C + 4K) - (2C + 2K) = 70 - 40

Which gives:

2K = 30

So, K = 15, same as before. Then, C = 20 -15 =5. So, same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of averages or something. Let me see.

If all 20 animals were chickens, how many legs would that be? 20*2=40 legs. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
