Q: Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will be Janeth's remaining balance by then?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. That means she's going to pay back more than she borrowed. Then, she's going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. I need to figure out how much she'll have left to pay after those 12 months. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the total amount she needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10%. So, I think that means she's paying back 10% interest on the $2000. Wait, that seems right. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. So, the total amount she needs to pay back is the principal plus the interest, which is $2000 + $200 = $2220. Let me write that down:

Total amount to pay back = Principal + Interest
Total amount to pay back = $2000 + 10% of $2000
Total amount to pay back = $2000 + $200
Total amount to pay back = $2220

Okay, so she needs to pay back a total of $2220. Now, she's going to pay $165 each month for 12 months. So, I need to calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12 months and then subtract that from the total amount she needs to pay back to find her remaining balance.

Let me calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months:

Total monthly payment = $165
Number of months = 12
Total amount paid = $165 * 12

Hmm, let me compute that. 165 times 12. Let me break it down: 165 * 10 = 0, 165 * 2 = 330. Wait, that seems right. 165 * 10 is 1650, so 165 *12 is 330. So, total amount paid is $330.

Wait, that seems right. 165 *12 is 330. So, she's going to pay $330 in total over 12 months? Wait, that seems right. 165 *122 is 165*10=1650, 165*2=330, so 1650+330=1980? Wait, that seems right.
