Q: Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in her backyard. It says that the bamboo grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. The question is asking, in how many days will its height be 600 inches? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent because right now, the growth rate is given in inches per day, and the current height is in feet. So, I should convert the current height from feet to inches to keep the units straight. I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 20 feet would be 20 multiplied by 12 inches. Let me calculate that: 20 times 12 is... 20 times 12 is 240, and 2 times 12 is 24, so adding those together, 240 + 24 is 264 inches. Okay, so today, the bamboo is 264 inches tall.

Now, the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. So, each day, its height increases by 30 inches. The question is asking how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 660 inches. Hmm, so I think I need to figure out the difference in height between today and when it will be 660 inches, and then divide that by the daily growth rate to find the number of days.

Let me write that down. The current height is 264 inches, and the target height is 660 inches. So, the difference in height is 660 minus 264. Let me compute that: 660 minus 264. Hmm, 660 minus 200 is 462, and then minus 64 more is... 462 minus 64. Let me subtract 60 from 462, which is 402, and then subtract 4 more, which is 400 - 4? Wait, that seems right. 462 minus 64 is 398 inches. So, the bamboo needs to grow 398 inches more to reach 660 inches.

Since it grows 30 inches each day, I can divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days. So, 398 divided by 30. Let me do that division. 30 goes into 398 how many times? Well, 30 times 13 is 90, which is too low because 30 times 13 is 90, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
