Q: Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Johnny picking up some toys, and I need to figure out how many blocks he picks up in total. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room. He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?"

Wait, that seems right. So, he has three different sets of toys: one with 500 pieces, another with 3 times more than that, and another with 1/4 the number of the first one. I need to find the total number of blocks he picks up if he takes all of them.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let's figure out how many pieces are in each set.

The first set is straightforward: 500 pieces. That's given directly. So, that's easy.

The second set is 3 times more than the first one. Hmm, "3 times more" can sometimes be confusing. Is that 3 times the original amount, or 3 times the original plus the original? Let me think. If something is 3 times more than another, that usually means 3 times the original. So, if the first set is 500, then the second set is 3 times 500. Let me write that down.

Second set: 3 * 500 = ?

Let me calculate that. 3 times 500. Well, 500 * 3 is 1500. So, the second set has 1500 pieces.

Okay, now the third set is 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set. So, 1/4 of 500. Let me compute that.

Third set: (1/4) * 500 = ?

Calculating 500 divided by 4. 500 divided by 4 is 125. So, 125 pieces.

So, now I have all three sets: 500, 1500, and 125. Now, to find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, I need to add all these together.

Total = 500 + 1500 + 125.

Let me add them step by step. First, 500 + 1500. That's 2000. Then, 2000 + 125. Hmm, 2000 + 100 is 2100, and then +25 is 2125. So, the total is 2125.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First set: 500. Second set: 3 times 500 is 1500. Third set: 1/4 of 500 is 125. Adding them up: 500 + 1500 is 2000, plus 125 is 2125. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me just think again about the wording. It says, "another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one." So, 3 times more than 500 is 1500. So, that's correct.

And the third set is 1/4 the number of pieces. So, 1/4 of 500 is 125. So, that's correct.

So, adding them all together: 500 + 1500 +125. Let me add 500 and 1500 first. 500 +1500 is 2000. Then, 200 +125 is 225. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 500 +1500 is 2000, plus 125 is 2125.

Wait, that seems right. So, 2125 is the total number of blocks Johnny picks up.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Sometimes, "3 times more" can be misinterpreted. For example, is it 3 times the original, or 3 times the original plus the original? So, if it's 3 times more, that's 3 times the original,
