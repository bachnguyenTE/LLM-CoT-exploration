Q: Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran 52 miles in total. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. How many miles did Ahito run?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. I need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. There are three people: Amber, Micah, and Ahito. The total miles they ran together is 52. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times the miles Amber ran. So, I need to find out how much Micah ran and then subtract both of their distances from the total to find out how much Ahito ran.

Let me write this down step by step. 

1. Total miles: 52
2. Amber's miles: 8
3. Micah's miles: 3.5 times Amber's miles

So, first, I can calculate Micah's miles. If Amber ran 8 miles, then Micah ran 3.5 times that. So, 3.5 multiplied by 8. Let me do that calculation.

3.5 * 8. Hmm, 3 times 8 is 24, and 0.5 times 8 is 4, so 24 + 4 is 28. So, Micah ran 28 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 3.5 is the same as 7/2, so 7/2 times 8 is (7*8)/2, which is 56/2, which is 28. Yep, that's correct.

So, now I know that Amber ran 8 miles, Micah ran 28 miles, and together they ran 52 miles. So, to find out how much Ahito ran, I can subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the overall total.

So, total miles run by all three is 52. So, 522 minus (8 + 28) should give me Ahito's miles.

Let me compute that. 8 + 28 is 36. So, 52 minus 36 is 16. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify again. 8 + 28 is 36, and 52 - 36 is indeed 16. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the total miles run by all three is 52. So, if I subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah, I should get Ahito's miles.

So, 52 - (Amber + Micah) = Ahito.

We know Amber is 8, Micah is 3.5 times 8, which is 28. So, 8 + 28 is 36. 52 - 36 is 16. So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up an equation to represent this.

Let me denote:

Let A = miles run by Amber = 8

Let M = miles run by Micah = 3.5 * A = 3.5 * 8 = 28

Let H = miles run by Ahito = ?

Total miles: A + M + H = 52

So, substituting the known values:

8 + 28 + H = 52

Which is 36 + H = 52

Therefore, H = 52 - 36 = 16

So, that's another way to set it up, and it still gives me H =16.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is 16 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way someone might approach this problem and maybe make a mistake.

For example, someone might think that 3.5 times 8 is 28, but, that seems right. Alternatively, someone might miscalculate 3.5 times 8 as 28.5 or something, but, that seems right. 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 times 8 is 28, which is 28. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, someone might think that 3.5 times 8 is 28, but, that seems right. 3.5 is 3 and a half, so 3 times 8 is 24, and 0.5 times 8 is 4, so 2
