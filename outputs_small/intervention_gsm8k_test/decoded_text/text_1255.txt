Q: Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of plants that require each type of water.

Crista has a total of 20 plants. Out of these, 4 plants need half a cup of water each. The remaining plants, which are 22, need a quarter of a cup each.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup each. Multiplying 4 by 0 cups gives 8 cups.

Then, I'll calculate the total amount of water needed for the 22 plants that require a quarter of a cup each. Multiplying 22 by 0.25 cups gives 5.5 cups.

Finally, I'll add the water needed for both groups of plants to find the total amount of water required daily. Adding 8 cups and 5.5 cups results in 13.5 cups.

To determine the total amount of water Crista needs to water all her plants every day, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total number of plants:** 20
- **Plants needing half a cup of water:** 4
- **Plants needing one cup of water:** 8
- **Plants needing a quarter cup of water:** Remaining plants

**Step 1: Calculate the number of plants needing a quarter cup of water.**

\[
\text{Total plants} - \text{Plants needing half a cup} - \text{Plants needing one cup} = \text{Plants needing a quarter cup}
\]

\[
20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total water needed for each category.**

1. **Half a cup of water:**
   \[
   4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup per plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **One cup of water:**
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup per plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Quarter cup of water:**
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup per plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

**Step 3: Sum up all the water needed.**

\[
2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
