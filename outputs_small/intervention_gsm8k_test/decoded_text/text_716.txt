Q: John makes himself a 6 egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.  Eggs are 75 calories each.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce.  How many calories is the omelet?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John making an omelet, and I need to figure out how many calories it has. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

John makes himself a 6-egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham. Each egg is 75 calories, cheese is 120 calories per ounce, and ham is 40 calories per ounce. The question is asking how many calories the omelet has, and the answer is supposed to be in a box, so I just need to write it there.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, the omelet has 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories. So, I think I need to calculate the total calories from the eggs. That should be 6 multiplied by 75. Let me write that down:

Calories from eggs = 6 * 75

Hmm, 6 times 75. Let me compute that. 6 times 70 is 420, and 6 times 5 is 30, so adding those together, 420 + 30 is 453. So, the eggs contribute 453 calories.

Next, the omelet has 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce. So, to find the calories from the cheese, I need to multiply 2 by 120. Let me do that:

Calories from cheese = 2 * 120

2 times 120. Well, 120 times 2 is 240. So, the cheese adds 240 calories.

Then, the omelet has an equal amount of ham. So, since the eggs are 6, the ham is also 6 ounces. Ham is 40 calories per ounce. So, the calories from the ham would be 6 multiplied by 40.

Calories from ham = 6 * 40

6 times 40. Let me calculate that. 6 times 40 is 240. So, the ham contributes 240 calories.

Now, to find the total calories of the omelet, I need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham. So, that would be:

Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham

Plugging in the numbers:

Total calories = 453 + 240 + 240

Let me add them step by step. First, 453 plus 240. Let me do that:

453 + 240. 400 + 200 is 600, and 53 + 40 is 93. So, 600 + 93 is 693. So, 453 + 240 is 693.

Now, add the 240 calories from ham to that. So, 693 + 240.

693 + 240. Let me break that down. 600 + 200 is 800, and 93 + 40 is 133. So, 800 + 133 is 933. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, I can add 693 + 240 directly.

693 + 240. Let's add the units place: 3 + 0 is 3. Tens place: 9 + 4 is 13, so carry over 1. Hundreds place: 6 + 2 is 8, plus the carried over 1 is 9. So, the total is 933.

Wait, that seems right. So, 693 + 240 is 933. So, the total calories are 933.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

First, eggs: 6 * 75. 75 * 6. 70*6=420, 5*6=30, so 420 + 30 = 453. That's correct.

Cheese: 2 * 120. 120 * 2 is 240. Correct.

Ham: 6 * 40. 40 * 6 is 240. Correct.

Adding them up: 453 + 240 + 240. Wait, that seems right. 453 + 240 is 693, plus another 240 is
