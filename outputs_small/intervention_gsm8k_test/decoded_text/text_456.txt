Q: In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?

Okay, so I have this problem about magicians cards, and I need to figure out the total number of cards in all the colors. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"In a set of magicians cards, there are 15 red cards, and 60% more green cards. Yellow cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?"

Alright, so we have three colors: red, green, and yellow. The problem gives me the number of red cards, which is 15. Then it says there are 60% more green cards than red. Hmm, okay, so green is more than red by 60%. Then, yellow cards are equal to the sum of red and green cards. So, I need to find the total number of all these cards.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, red cards: that's straightforward, it's 15.

Next, green cards: it says there are 60% more green cards than red. So, if red is 15, then green is 15 plus 60% of 15. Wait, that seems right. So, 60% of 15 is... let me calculate that.

60% is the same as 0.6 in decimal. So, 0.6 multiplied by 15. 0.6 * 15. Let me do that: 15 * 0.6. 15 * 0.6 is 9. So, 60% of 15 is 9. So, green cards are 15 + 9 = 24. So, green is 24.

Wait, that seems right. So, red is 15, green is 24. Then, yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green. So, sum of red and green is 15 +24. Let me add that: 15 +24 is 39. So, yellow is 39.

So, now, to find the total number of cards, I need to add red, green, and yellow together. So, 15 +24 +39.

Let me add 15 and 24 first: 15 +24 is 39. Then, 39 +39 is 78. So, total is 78.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Red: 15.

Green: 60% more than red. So, 60% of 15 is 9, so green is 15 +9=24.

Yellow: sum of red and green, which is 15 +24=39.

Total: 15 +24 +39=78.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the total number of cards is 78.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to verify.

If red is 15, and green is 60% more than red, so green is 15 + (0.6*15)=15 +9=24.

Then, yellow is equal to red + green, which is 15 +24=39.

So, total is 15 +24 +39=78.

Yes, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of variables.

Let R be red cards, G be green, Y be yellow.

Given: R =15.

G = R + 60% of R = R + 0.6R =1.6R.

So, G=1.6*15=24.

Then, Y = R + G =15 +24=39.

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, Y=39.

So, total is R + G + Y=15 +24 +39=78.

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
