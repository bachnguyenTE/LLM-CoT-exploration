Q: Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. How many tubes of paint does Jasper have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ben and Jasper with tubes of paint. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. So, Ben's total paint is blue plus yellow. That part seems straightforward. But, that seems right. So, Ben has 4 blue and 3 yellow, so total blue is 4, total yellow is 3. 

Now, the problem goes on to say that Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total. 

Let me break it down. For blue paint, Jasper has half as many as Ben. Ben has 4 blue tubes, so half of 4 is... let me calculate that. Half of 4 is 2. So, Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint. That seems right.

Now, for the yellow paint. The problem says Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Ben has 3 yellow tubes, so three times 3 is... 9. So, Jasper has 9 tubes of yellow paint. 

So, now, to find the total number of tubes Jasper has, I need to add up his blue and yellow paints. So, 2 blue tubes plus 9 yellow tubes. Let me add those together. 2 plus 9 is 11. So, does that mean Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total? 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Ben has 4 blue and 3 yellow. Jasper has half the blue, so 4 divided by 2 is 2. That's correct. And three times the yellow, so 3 times 3 is 9. 2 plus 9 is 11. Yeah, that seems right. 

So, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is 11. 

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, Ben has 4 blue and 3 yellow. Jasper has half the blue, so 2 blue, and three times the yellow, so 9 yellow. 2 plus 9 is 11. Yeah, that's correct. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 11 tubes of paint in total. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the problem is asking for the total number of tubes, so 11 is the total. So, I think that's the answer. 

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to interpret the problem. 

Wait, that seems right. So, no, I don't think so. So, I think 11 is the correct answer. 

So, summarizing: 

Ben has 4 blue and 3 yellow. 

Jasper has half the blue, which is 2, and three times the yellow, which is 9. 

Total for Jasper is 2 + 9 = 11. 

So, the answer is 11. 

Yeah, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, I think that's the answer. 

**Final Answer**
Jasper has a total of \boxed{11} tubes of paint.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben.

First, we calculate the number of blue paint tubes Jasper has:
\[
\text{Blue paint (Jasper)} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has:
\[
\text{Yellow paint (Jasper)} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

Adding these together gives the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has:
\[
\text{Total paint (Jasper)} = 2 + 9 = 11
\]

Thus, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is \boxed{11}.
