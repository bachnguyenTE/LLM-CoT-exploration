Q: Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?

Okay, so Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. Let me see, she can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest are blue. The total number of jellybeans is 60. Hmm, I need to find out how many blue jellybeans there are.

Alright, let's break this down. First, we know the number of green jellybeans is 17. That's straightforward. Then, the number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green ones. So, if green is 17, red must be 2 times 17. Let me write that down.

Number of green jellybeans = 17.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 × 17.

Calculating that, 2 × 17 is 34. So, there are 34 red jellybeans.

Now, the rest of the jellybeans are blue. So, to find the number of blue jellybeans, I need to subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Total jellybeans = 60.

So, number of blue jellybeans = total jellybeans - green - red.

Plugging in the numbers, that's 60 - 17 - 34.

Let me do the subtraction step by step. First, 60 minus 17. Hmm, 60 minus 10 is 50, and then minus 7 more is 43. Wait, that seems right. 17 plus 43 is 60. Yeah, that checks out.

Now, subtract the red jellybeans, which are 34. So, 43 minus 34. Let me calculate that. 43 minus 30 is 13, and then minus 4 more is 9. So, 43 - 34 is 9.

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total jellybeans: 60.

Green:17, red:34.

17 + 34 is 51. 60 - 51 is 9. Yep, that's correct.

So, I think the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

**Final Answer**
The number of blue jellybeans is \boxed{9}.

Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She knows there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. The rest are blue jellybeans, and the total number of jellybeans is 60.

First, we calculate the number of red jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
\]

Next, we find the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[
\text{Total green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
\]

We then subtract this from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is \boxed{9}.
