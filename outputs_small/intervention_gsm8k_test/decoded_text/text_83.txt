Q: Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are there total? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find out how many thorns there are in total. To do that, I think I should start by figuring out how many roses there are in total, and then multiply that by the number of thorns each rose has. That makes sense because if each rose has 8 thorns, then the total number of thorns would be the total number of roses multiplied by 8.

So, Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. That means the total number of roses is 3 multiplied by 25. Let me write that down: 3 * 25. Hmm, 3 times 25 is 15. So, there are 15 roses in total? Wait, that seems right. 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, so 3*25=75? Wait, that seems right. 25 is 25, so 3*25 is 75? Wait, that seems right. 25*3 is 75. Oh, wait, that seems right. 25*3 is 75. So, 75 roses in total.

Now, each rose has 8 thorns. So, to find the total number of thorns, I need to multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose. So, that would be 75 * 8. Hmm, let me calculate that. 75*8. Well, 70*8 is 560, and 5*8 is 40, so 560 + 40 is 600. So, 75*8 is 600. So, the total number of thorns is 600.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses: 3*25=75. Then, each rose has 8 thorns: 75*8=600. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I could think of it as 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, each with 8 thorns. So, 3*25*8. Let me compute that in another way. 25*8 is 200, and 3*200 is 600. So, same result. So, that's consistent.

So, I think the total number of thorns is 600. That seems to make sense. Let me just visualize it to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses, each with 8 thorns. So, each rose is a flower with 8 thorns. So, each rose contributes 8 thorns. So, 25 roses per bush, so 25*8=200 thorns per bush. Then, 3 bushes, so 200*3=600. Yeah, that's another way to think about it.

So, I think I'm confident that the total number of thorns is 600. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. It all adds up correctly.

**Final Answer**
The total number of thorns is \boxed{600}.

Dan plants 3 rose bushes, each with 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we first calculate the total number of roses:

\[
3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

\[
75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns}
\]

Thus, the total number of thorns is \boxed{600}.
