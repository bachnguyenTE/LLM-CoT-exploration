Q: Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Manny signing up for Karate classes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents are telling him that if the classes end up costing more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 total classes. The question is, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. Manny has already paid $60 for all 10 classes. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he's already paid for all the classes, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if he misses some classes, the cost per class might increase, and then his parents will stop him from signing him up again.

So, the key here is that if the cost per class goes above $10, he can't sign up again. So, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost is $60, and there are 10 classes. So, the average cost per class is $60 divided by 10, which is $6 per class. So, right now, each class is $6. But, that seems right. So, if he misses some classes, the total cost will be the same, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if he misses a class, the total cost is still $60, but, that seems right. So, the average cost per class would be $60 divided by the number of classes he actually attends.

So, if he misses some classes, the number of classes he attends is less than 10, so the average cost per class would be higher. So, we need to find the number of classes he can miss before the average cost per class exceeds $10.

So, let me formalize this. Let me denote the number of classes he can miss as x. So, if he misses x classes, he attends (10 - x) classes. The total cost is still $60, so the average cost per class would be 60 divided by (10 - x). We need this average cost to be greater than $10.

So, the inequality we need is:

60 / (10 - x) > 10

We need to solve for x.

So, let's write that down:

60 / (10 - x) > 10

We can solve this inequality step by step.

First, let's multiply both sides by (10 - x). But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if we multiply both sides by (10 - x), we have to be careful because (10 - x) is in the denominator, so it's positive as long as x is less than 10, which it is because he can't miss more than 10 classes.

So, multiplying both sides by (10 - x) gives:

60 > 10*(10 - x)

Simplify the right side:

60 > 110 - 10x

Now, let's subtract 110 from both sides:

60 - 110 > -10x

Which is:

-50 > -10x

Now, we can divide both sides by -10. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, when we divide both sides by a negative number, we have to reverse the inequality sign.

So, dividing both sides by -10:

-50 / -10 > x

Which simplifies to:

5.5 > x

So, x < 5.5

But, that seems right. So, x is less than 5.5. But, that seems right. So, since x is the number of classes he can miss, it has to be an integer. So, x must be less than 5.5, so x can be 5 or less.

Wait, that seems right. So, if x is 5, then he can miss 5 classes, and the average cost per class would be 60 / (10 - 5) = 60 / 5 = 12. So, that's more than 10, so he can't sign him up again.

If he misses 6 classes, then he attends 4 classes, so the average cost per class is
