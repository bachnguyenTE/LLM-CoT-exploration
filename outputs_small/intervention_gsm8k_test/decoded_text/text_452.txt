Q: A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where a car is on a road trip. It drives at 60 mph for 2 hours and then switches to 30 mph for 1 hour. The question is asking for the car's average speed during this entire trip. Hmm, average speed... I remember that average speed is different from just taking the average of the two speeds. Let me think about how to calculate it.

First, I recall that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I need to find out how far the car traveled in total and then divide that by the total time it took for the trip. That makes sense because average speed isn't just the average of the two speeds; it's more about the overall distance covered over the overall time.

Alright, so let's break it down. The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. To find the distance covered in that first part, I can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

So, for the first part, that would be 60 mph multiplied by 2 hours. Let me write that out:

Distance1 = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Okay, so the car traveled 120 miles in the first two hours. Now, moving on to the second part of the trip. The car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. Again, using the same formula:

Distance2 = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Got it, so the car traveled an additional 30 miles in the next hour. Now, to find the total distance the car traveled during the entire trip, I need to add these two distances together.

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Alright, so the car went a total of 150 miles. Now, I need to find the total time the trip took. The first part took 2 hours and the second part took 1 hour, so adding those together:

Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Perfect, so the total time is 3 hours. Now, to find the average speed, I take the total distance and divide it by the total time.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 150 miles / 3 hours

Let me do that division. 150 divided by 3 is 50. So, 150 divided by 3 is 50. Therefore, the average speed is 50 mph.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 60 mph for 2 hours is 120 miles, and 30 mph for 1 hour is 30 miles. Adding those together gives 150 miles. The total time is 3 hours. 150 divided by 3 is indeed 50. So, yes, the average speed is 50 mph.

I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the car's average speed during the entire trip is 50 mph.

**Final Answer**
The car's average speed during the trip is \boxed{50} mph.

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \,000 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The car then drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The total distance traveled is the sum of the two distances:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. The total time taken for the trip is the sum of the two times:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
   \]

The car's average speed during the trip is \boxed{50} mph.
