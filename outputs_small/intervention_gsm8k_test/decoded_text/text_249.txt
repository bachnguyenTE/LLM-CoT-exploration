Q: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Sue and her sister eating cookies over two days, and I need to figure out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. The sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day. Each cookie has 200 calories. I need to find how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

Alright, so let's list out the information:

- Sister's Monday cookies: 5
- Sister's Tuesday cookies: 13
- Sue's Monday cookies: 4 times the sister's Monday
- Sue's Tuesday cookies: 2 times the sister's Tuesday
- Calories per cookie: 200 (I think that's 200 calories, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 200 is 200 calories per cookie.)

Wait, that seems right. So, 200 calories per cookie. So, each cookie is 220 calories.

So, first, let me figure out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Wait, that seems right. 4 times 5 is 20. So, Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

So, Sue's total cookies: Monday + Tuesday = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Sister's total cookies: Monday + Tuesday = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Wait, that seems right. So, Sue ate 46 cookies, her sister ate 18 cookies.

Now, each cookie is 220 calories. So, total calories for Sue: 46 * 220.

Total calories for her sister: 18 * 220.

Then, subtract the sister's calories from Sue's to find the difference.

Let me compute that.

First, let me compute Sue's total calories.

46 * 220. Hmm, 46 * 200 is 9200, and 46 * 20 is 920. So, 9200 + 920 = 10,120 calories.

Wait, that seems right. 46 * 220 is 10,120.

Now, her sister's total calories: 18 * 220.

18 * 200 is 3,600, and 18 * 20 is 160. So, 3,600 + 160 = 3,760 calories.

So, Sue consumed 10,120 calories, her sister consumed 3,760 calories.

Now, the question is how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister.

So, subtract the sister's calories from Sue's: 10,120 - 3,760.

Let me compute that.

10,120 - 3,760.

Subtracting 3,000 from 10,120 gives 7,120.

Then subtract 760: 7,120 - 760.

7,120 - 700 is 6,420, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 7,120 - 760 is 6,360.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check:

7,120 - 760.

7,120 minus 700 is 7,052, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
