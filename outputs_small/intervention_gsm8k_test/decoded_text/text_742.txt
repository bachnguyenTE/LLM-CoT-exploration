Q: In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about two classes in a school. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that there are two classes with a total of 80 students. Each class has the same number of students, and in each class, 40% of the students are girls. I need to find out how many boys are in each class. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the total number of students in both classes combined is 80. Since there are two classes and each has the same number of students, I can find out how many students are in each class individually. To do that, I should divide the total number of students by 2. So, 80 divided by 2 is 40. That means each class has 40 students. Wait, that seems right. So, each class has 40 students.

Now, in each class, 40% of the students are girls. So, I need to find out how many girls are in each class first, and then subtract that number from the total number of students in the class to find the number of boys. Let me write that down.

In each class:
- Total students = 40
- Percentage of girls = 40%

So, the number of girls in each class is 40% of 40. To calculate that, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. 40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form. So, 0.40 multiplied by 40 gives me the number of girls.

Let me compute that: 0.40 * 40. Hmm, 0.4 times 40 is 16, and 0.0 times 40 is 0. Wait, that seems right. So, 0.40 * 40 is 16. So, there are 16 girls in each class.

Now, since each class has 40 students in total and 16 are girls, the remaining students must be boys. So, the number of boys in each class is 40 minus 16. Let me subtract that: 40 - 16 is 24. So, there are 24 boys in each class.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 40 students in each class, 40% are girls. 40% of 40 is 16 girls, so 40 -16 is 24 boys. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. If each class has 40 students, and 40% are girls, that's 16 girls and 24 boys. So, 16 +24 is 40, which matches the total number of students. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 24 boys in each class. So, the number of boys in each class is 24.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using fractions instead of percentages? Let me try that.

40% of 40 students is the number of girls. So, 40% is the same as 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5. So, 2/5 of 40 is the number of girls. Let me compute that: 40 divided by 5 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 2 is 16. So, that's 16 girls, same as before. So, 40 -16 is 24 boys. So, same result.

Okay, so that seems consistent. So, whether I use percentages or fractions, I get the same number of girls and boys. So, that gives me more confidence that 24 is the correct number of boys in each class.

Wait, that seems right. So, each class has 40 students, 16 are girls, 24 are boys. So, 16 +24 is 40, which is the total number of students in each class. So, that's correct.

So, the answer is 24 boys in each class. So, I think that's the correct answer.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else? Hmm, not really, because the problem is straightforward. It's just giving me the total number of students and the percentage of girls in each class, so it's pretty straightforward.

So, in summary, each class has 40 students, 40% of them are girls,
