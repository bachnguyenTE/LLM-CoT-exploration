Q: The Science Center hosted field trips Monday through Friday last week. On Monday, 32 classes visited. Twice as many visited on Tuesday and three times as many visited on Wednesday. Another 30 classes visited on Thursday and 25 visited on Friday. In all, how many classes visited the Science Center last week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the Science Center field trips. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the Science Center hosted field trips from Monday through Friday last week. That means they had five days of field trips: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Monday, 32 classes visited. That's straightforward. Then, it says twice as many visited on Tuesday. So, if Monday was 32, Tuesday must be double that. Let me write that down: Tuesday = 2 * Monday. So, 2 * 32. Hmm, 2 times 30 is 60, plus 2 times 2 is 4, so 64. So, Tuesday had 64 classes.

Then, it says three times as many visited on Wednesday. So, Wednesday is 3 times Monday. So, 3 * 32. Let me calculate that. 3 times 30 is 90, plus 3 times 2 is 6, so 96. So, Wednesday had 96 classes.

On Thursday, another 30 classes visited. That's given directly, so Thursday is 30. And on Friday, 25 classes visited. So, Friday is 25.

Now, to find the total number of classes that visited last week, I need to add up the number of classes from each day. So, Monday is 32, Tuesday is 64, Wednesday is 96, Thursday is 30, and Friday is 25.

Let me add them up one by one. Starting with Monday and Tuesday: 32 + 64. Hmm, 32 + 60 is 98, plus 4 is 102? Wait, that seems right. 32 + 64 is 96. Wait, that seems right. 32 + 64: 30 + 60 is 90, and 2 +4 is 6, so 96. Okay, so Monday and Tuesday together are 96.

Then, Wednesday is 96. So, adding Wednesday to that: 96 + 96. Let me do that. 96 + 96. 90 + 90 is 180, and 6 +6 is 12, so 180 +12 is 192. So, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday together are 192.

Then, Thursday is 30. So, adding Thursday: 192 +30. That's 222. Because 192 +30 is 222. Then, Friday is 25. So, adding Friday: 222 +25. Let me compute that. 222 +20 is 242, and then +5 is 247. So, total is 247.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Monday: 32

Tuesday: 2*32=64

Wednesday:3*32=96

Thursday:30

Friday:25

Adding them up: 32 +64=96; 96+96=192; 192+30=222; 222+25=247.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using variables or something else, but, that seems right. Alternatively, I can write it out as an equation.

Let M be the number of classes on Monday, which is 32.

Then, Tuesday is 2M, so 2*32=64.

Wednesday is 3M, so 3*32=96.

Thursday is 30.

Friday is 25.

So, total classes = M + 2M + 3M +30 +25.

Wait, that seems right. So, M +2M +3M is 6M. So, 6M +30 +25.

So, 6M is 6*32=192.

Then, 192 +30=222, 222 +25=247.

Yes, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using variables, and it still gives me 247.

So, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 247.

**Final Answer**
The total number of
