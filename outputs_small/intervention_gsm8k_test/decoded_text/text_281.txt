Q: A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?

Okay, so I have this math problem here about cobra and mamba spots in a snake park. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

"A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?"

Hmm, okay. So, we have two types of snakes: cobras and mambas. Each has a certain number of spots, and we need to find half the total number of spots when considering all the snakes in the park.

Let me break it down. First, the problem says a cobra has 70 spots and twice as many as a mamba. So, if a cobra has 70 spots, then a mamba must have half that number, right? Because it's twice as many. So, if 70 is twice the number of mambas' spots, then the number of spots on a mamba is 70 divided by 2.

Let me write that down:

Number of spots on a mamba = 70 / 2

Calculating that, 70 divided by 2 is 35. So, each mamba has 35 spots.

Wait, that seems right. So, a mamba has 35 spots, and a cobra has twice that, which is 70. That makes sense.

Now, moving on. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the park. So, we need to find the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas combined, and then take half of that total.

So, first, let's calculate the total number of spots for the cobras. Each cobra has 70 spots, and there are 40 of them. So, total spots for cobras = 40 * 70.

Let me compute that. 40 times 70. Hmm, 40 times 70. Let me break that down. 40 times 70 is the same as 40 times 70. 40 times 70 is 2800. Wait, that seems right. Because 40 times 70 is 2800.

Okay, so total spots for cobras is 2800.

Now, moving on to the mambas. Each mamba has 35 spots, and there are 60 of them. So, total spots for mambas = 60 * 35.

Calculating that, 60 times 35. Hmm, 60 times 35. Let me think. 60 times 30 is 1800, and 60 times 5 is 300. So, 1800 + 300 is 2100. So, total spots for mambas is 2100.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. 35 times 60: 35 times 6 is 210, so 35 times 60 is 2100. Yes, that's correct.

So, total spots for mambas is 2100.

Now, to find the total number of spots in the park, we add the total spots from cobras and mambas together.

Total spots = 2800 (cobras) + 2100 (mambas)

Let me add those together. 2800 + 2100 is 4900, and then plus 100 is 5000. Wait, that seems right. 2800 + 2100 is 4910, plus 10 is 4920? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
