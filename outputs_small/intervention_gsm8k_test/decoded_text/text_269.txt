Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls.  Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue.  How many blue golf balls are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the juggler has 16 balls in total. That's straightforward. Now, half of these balls are golf balls. So, I need to find out how many of those 16 balls are golf balls. To do that, I can calculate half of 16. Let me write that down:

Number of golf balls = 16 / 2 = 8.

So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, the problem says that half of the golf balls are blue. So, I need to find half of 8. Let me calculate that:

Number of blue golf balls = 8 / 2 = 4.

Wait, that seems right. So, if there are 8 golf balls and half of them are blue, then there must be 4 blue golf balls. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 16 balls. Half of them are golf balls, so 16 divided by 2 is indeed 8. Then, half of those 8 golf balls are blue, so 8 divided by 2 is 4. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward. It's just a matter of dividing the total number of balls by 2 twice, once for the golf balls and then again for the blue ones. So, 16 divided by 2 is 8, and 8 divided by 2 is 4. Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire structure of the balls. If half of the balls are golf balls, then the other half are not. So, 16 balls, half are golf, half are not. That gives us 8 golf balls and 8 non-golf balls. Then, half of the golf balls are blue, so 4 are blue, and the other half, which is 4, are non-blue. So, that also gives us 4 blue golf balls.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of fractions. The fraction of the total balls that are blue golf balls is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. So, 1/4 of 16 is 4. That also gives me the same answer. So, that's another way to confirm it.

I think I'm confident that the answer is 4 blue golf balls. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem that would lead to a different result. It's pretty straightforward once you break it down into steps. So, yeah, 4 blue golf balls.

**Final Answer**
The number of blue golf balls is \boxed{4}.

The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. 

First, we calculate the number of golf balls:
\[
\text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Next, we find the number of blue golf balls, which is half of the 8 golf balls:
\[
\text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

Thus, the number of blue golf balls is \boxed{4}.
