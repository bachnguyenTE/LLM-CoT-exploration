Q: Charlie has boots that are five times the size of Sophie's. If Sophie wears size five boots, what is the average size of shoe worn by the two?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Charlie has boots that are five times the size of Sophie's. If Sophie wears size five boots, what is the average size of shoe worn by the two? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says Charlie has boots that are five times the size of Sophie's. So, if Sophie has a certain size, Charlie has five times that size. Then, it says Sophie wears size five boots. Wait, that seems right. So Sophie's boots are size five. Therefore, Charlie's boots would be five times that, which would be 5 times 5, which is 25. So Charlie has boots that are 25 size.

Now, the question is asking for the average size of the shoes worn by the two. So, we have Sophie and Charlie, each wearing their own size of boots. So, Sophie wears size five, and Charlie wears size 25. To find the average, I need to add their sizes together and then divide by the number of people, which is two.

Let me write that down. The formula for the average is (sum of all values) divided by (number of values). So, in this case, that would be (5 + 25) divided by 2. Let me compute that. 5 plus 25 is 30, and 30 divided by 2 is 15.5. So, the average size is 15.5.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Sophie's boots are size five, and Charlie's are five times that, so 5 times five is 25. Then, adding 5 and 25 gives 30, divided by 2 is 15.5. Yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. So, the average size is 15.5. Hmm, is there another way to think about this? Maybe in terms of ratios or something else?

Let me think. If Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, that means Charlie's boots are larger. So, if Sophie wears size five, Charlie wears five times that, which is 25. So, the sizes are 5 and 25. The average is (5 + 25)/2, which is 30/2, which is 15. So, 15.5 is the same as 15.5. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of ratios. The ratio of Sophie's size to Charlie's size is 1:5. So, Sophie is 1 part, Charlie is 5 parts. So, the total parts are 6. So, the average would be (1 + 5)/6, which is 6/6, which is 1. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
