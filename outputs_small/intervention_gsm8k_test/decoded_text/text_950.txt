Okay, so I have this problem here where Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Wait, that seems right. So, the total points they scored together is 45. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total points are 45. But, that seems right. So, the problem is asking how many points Azibo scored. Hmm.

Let me read the problem again: Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. How many points did Azibo score?

So, let me break this down. First, the total points are 45. So, the sum of Bahati's points, Azibo's points, and Dinar's points is 45. So, if I let B be Bahati's points, A be Azibo's points, and D be Dinar's points, then B + A + D = 45.

Then, it says Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo. So, that means B = A + 20. And it's also 10 more than Dinar. So, B = D + 10.

So, now I have three equations:

1. B + A + D = 45
2. B = A + 20
3. B = D + 10

So, I need to solve for A, which is Azibo's points.

Let me see. Since I have B expressed in terms of A and D, maybe I can substitute those into the first equation.

From equation 2: B = A + 20. So, I can replace B in equation 1 with A + 20.

So, equation 1 becomes: (A + 20) + A + D = 45.

Simplify that: 2A + D + 20 = 45.

Subtract 20 from both sides: 2A + D = 25.

Okay, so that's equation 4: 2A + D = 25.

Now, from equation 3: B = D + 10. So, since B is also A + 20, we can set A + 20 = D +10.

So, A +20 = D +10.

Subtract 10 from both sides: A +10 = D.

So, D = A +10.

So, now, we can substitute D in equation 4.

Equation 4: 2A + D =25.

But, that seems right. So, D is A +10, so substitute that in:

2A + (A +10) =25.

Simplify: 3A +10 =25.

Subtract 10: 3A =15.

Divide by 3: A=5.

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

So, if A=5, then D = A +10=15.

And B = A +20=25.

So, adding them up: 25 +5 +15=45. That adds up.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, Azibo scored 5 points.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total is 45, and the points are 25,5,15. So, 25 is the highest, which is 20 more than 5, and 10 more than 15. So, that's correct.

So, yeah, Azibo scored 5 points.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 5.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The number of points Azibo scored is \boxed{5}.

Let \( B \) be Bahati's points, \( A \) be Azibo's points, and \( D \) be Dinar's points. We know the following:

1. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in
