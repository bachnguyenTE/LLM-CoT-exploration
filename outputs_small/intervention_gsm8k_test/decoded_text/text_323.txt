Q: Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?

Okay, so I have this problem about Shannon making iced coffee. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Shannon brews hot coffee and then adds ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Also, any added liquid weakens the coffee. The question is asking how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, the coffee is being cooled by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees. So, how many ice cubes does she need to cool it by 65 degrees? 

Let me calculate that. If each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees, then the number of ice cubes needed would be 65 divided by 13. Let me do that: 65 ÷ 13 is 5. So, she needs 5 ice cubes. 

Wait, that seems right. 13 times 5 is 65, so yeah, 5 ice cubes. 

Now, each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes would make the coffee 5 times 12 milliliters weaker. Let me compute that: 5 * 12 is 60. So, 60 milliliters weaker from the ice cubes.

But, that seems right. Each ice cube adds 12 ml of weakness, so 5 of them would be 60 ml. 

But, that seems right. So, the ice cubes contribute 60 ml of weakness.

But, that seems right. Now, the question also mentions that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. So, she added 15 milliliters of cream. So, that 15 ml of cream also contributes to the weakness.

So, the cream is 15 ml, so that's another 15 ml of weakness.

So, total weakness would be the sum of the ice cubes and the cream. So, 60 ml + 15 ml is 75 ml.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 ice cubes each contributing 12 ml, so 5*12=10, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
