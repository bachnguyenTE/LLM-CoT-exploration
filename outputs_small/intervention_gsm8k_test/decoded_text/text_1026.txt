Q: One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about dwarves mining ore. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. That's straightforward. So, without any pickaxe, he mines 12 pounds each day. 

Next, it says he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe. Hmm, so if he uses an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much as with bare hands. Since he mines 12 pounds with bare hands, twice that would be 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. Let me write that down:

- Bare hands: 12 pounds/day
- Iron pickaxe: 2 * 12 = 24 pounds/day

Now, it also mentions that he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. So, if he mines 24 pounds with an iron pickaxe, then with a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 50% more than 24 pounds. Let me calculate that. 

First, 50% of 24 is 0.5 * 24. Let me compute that: 0.5 * 24 is 12. So, 24 + 12 = 36 pounds. So, with a steel pickaxe, he mines 36 pounds per day. 

Let me write that down too:

- Steel pickaxe: 24 + (0.5 * 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds/day

So, summarizing:

- Bare hands: 12 lb/day
- Iron pickaxe:24 lb/day
- Steel pickaxe:36 lb/day

Wait, that seems right. 50% more than 24 is 36, yes.

Now, the question is asking: How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?

So, first, let's figure out how much one dwarf mines with a steel pickaxe in a day, which we already know is 36 pounds.

Then, since there are 40 dwarves, we need to multiply 36 by 40 to get the total per day for all 40 dwarves.

Let me compute that: 36 * 40. Hmm, 36*40 is 1440 pounds per day.

Wait, that seems right. 36*40: 36*4=144, so 1440.

But, that seems right. So, 40 dwarves each mine 36 pounds a day, so 40*36=1440 pounds per day.

Now, the question is about a month. It doesn't specify whether it's 30 days or 31 or 30. Hmm, the problem says "with 30 days," so I think it's 30 days.

So, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in 30 days.

So, first, we can compute the daily total, which is 1440 pounds, and then multiply by 30 days.

So, 1440 * 30. Let me compute that.

1440 * 30: 1440*3=4320, so 4320*10=43200.

Wait, that seems right. 1440*30 is 43,200 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify:

1440 * 30: 1440*30 is (1440*3)*10. 1440*3 is 4320, so 4320*10 is 43,220. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 1440*30 is 43,200.

Wait, that seems right. 1440*30 is 43,200.

Wait, that seems right. So, 43,200 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine 43,200 pounds in a month.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds per day.

2. 40 dwarves:
