Q: Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?

Okay, so Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She wants to divide these into 3 rows, and in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Then, she uses the remaining cups for cinnamon tea, which totals 15 cups. The question is asking how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, she has 27 cups. She divides them into 3 rows. So, if I divide 27 by 3, that should give me the number of cups in each row. Let me do that: 27 divided by 3 is 9. So, each row has 9 cups.

Now, in each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. That means in each row, the number of chamomile cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. So, if each row has 9 cups, and half of them are chamomile and half are mint, that would mean each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea. But, that seems right.
