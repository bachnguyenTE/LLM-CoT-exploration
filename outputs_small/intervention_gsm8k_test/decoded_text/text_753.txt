Okay, so I have this problem here about Jeff and his catering company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Jeff owns a catering company. During a recent event, he sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Then, when they were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. The question is asking how many glasses and plates Jeff has now. And the answer is given as A, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, maybe I need to write down the steps to make sure I understand.

Alright, so let's break it down. Jeff sent out 8 dozen glasses. A dozen is 12, so 8 dozen would be 8 times 12. Let me calculate that. 8 times 12 is 96. So, he sent out 96 glasses. Then, when they were returned, 10 glasses were broken. So, that means 10 glasses were broken out of the 96 he sent. So, how many are left? Well, he sent 96, and 10 were broken, so 96 minus 10. Wait, that seems right. 96 minus 10 is 85. So, he has 85 glasses left.

Similarly, for the plates. He sent 4 dozen plates. A dozen is 12, so 4 times 12 is 48. So, he sent out 48 plates. Then, 6 plates were broken. So, how many are left? 48 minus 6. That's 42. So, 42 plates remain.

So, putting it all together, Jeff has 85 glasses and 42 plates left. So, the total number of items he has now is 85 plus 42. Let me add those. 85 plus 40 is 125, and then plus 2 is 127. So, 127 items in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 8 dozen glasses: 8 x 12 is 96. 96 minus 10 is 86? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
