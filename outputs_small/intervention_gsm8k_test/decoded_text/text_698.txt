Q: Greta’s paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. After funding her retirement and paying for her car, how much money does she have left to spend?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Greta's paycheck and her expenses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. That seems straightforward. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her monthly car payment. After that, I need to find out how much money she has left to spend. Hmm, okay.

Let me break it down. Maybe I should start by calculating how much she puts into her retirement account. If she puts 50% of her $2400 into retirement, that should be 50% of 2400. To find that, I can convert 50% to a decimal, which is 0.50, and multiply it by 2400.

So, 0.50 times 2400. Let me do that multiplication. Hmm, 2400 times 0.5 is 1225, and 2400 times 0.0 is 240. So, adding those together, 1225 + 240 is 1465. So, she puts $1465 into her retirement account.

Wait, that seems right. 50% of 2400 is indeed 1465. Okay, so she has $1465 in retirement. 

Now, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment. So, 20% of 2400. Let me calculate that. 20% is 0.20 in decimal, so 0.20 times 2400. Let me see, 2400 times 0.2 is 480. So, she spends $480 on her car.

So, she spent $1465 on retirement and $480 on her car. Now, I need to subtract both of these amounts from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left.

Let me add the two expenses together: 1465 + 480. Hmm, 1465 + 400 is 1865, and then +80 is 1945. So, she has spent a total of $1945.

Now, subtracting that from her original paycheck: 2400 - 1945. Let me do that subtraction. 2400 minus 1900 is 500, and then minus 45 more is 455. So, she has $455 left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 50% of 2400 is 1465. That's correct because 50% is half, so half of 2400 is 1200, and half of 400 is 200, so 1200 + 200 is 1400. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
