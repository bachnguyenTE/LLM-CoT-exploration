Q: The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet. If the length of his room is 3 yards, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Billie's rectangular bedroom. The area is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. I need to find the perimeter of the room in feet. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. The formula is Area = Length × Width. So, if I know the area and the length, I can find the width. Once I have both the length and the width, I can calculate the perimeter, which is the sum of all the sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). 

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me make sure. Yeah, for a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so adding length and width and multiplying by two gives the total perimeter. Okay, so that's the plan.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, if the area is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, I need to make sure that the units are consistent. The area is in square feet, so the length should also be in feet or converted to feet. Since the area is in square feet, I should convert the length from yards to feet.

I remember that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet. So, if the length is 3 yards, that's 3 times 3 feet, which is 9 feet. So, the length is 9 feet. Got that.

Now, using the area formula, which is 360 square feet, and the length is 9 feet, I can find the width. So, Area = Length × Width, so Width = Area / Length. Plugging in the numbers, Width = 360 / 9. Let me calculate that.

360 divided by 9. Hmm, 9 goes into 36 four times (since 9×4=36), and then there's a 0 left. So, 360 divided by 9 is 40. Wait, that seems right. 9 times 40 is 360. Yeah, because 9 times 40 is 360. So, the width is 40 feet.

Wait, that seems right. So, the width is 40 feet. So, now, I have both the length and the width. Length is 9 feet, width is 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, I use the formula: Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). So, plugging in the numbers, that's 2 × (9 + 40). Let me compute that.

First, 9 + 40 is 49. Then, 2 × 49 is 98. So, the perimeter is 98 feet.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just verify each step again.

1. Area is 360 square feet.
2. Length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet.
3. So, width is 360 / 9 = 40 feet.
4. Perimeter is 2*(9 + 40) = 2*49 = 98 feet.
