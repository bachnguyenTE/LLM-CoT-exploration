Q: The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about electric poles and wires in a neighborhood. It says the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, and there are 45 wires needed. I need to find out how many poles are required. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. That means for every pole, there are three wires. Or, in other words, the number of poles is one-third the number of wires. Wait, that seems right. So, if I have more wires, the number of poles would be less, and vice versa.

Let me write that down. If the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, then the number of poles is (1/3) times the number of wires. So, mathematically, that would be:

Number of poles = (1/3) * Number of wires

Given that the number of wires is 45, I can plug that into the equation.

Number of poles = (1/3) * 45

Let me compute that. 45 divided by 3 is 15. So, the number of poles is 15.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If the ratio is 1:3, then for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. So, if there are 45 wires, how many sets of 3 wires are there? That would be 45 divided by 3, which is 15. So, each set corresponds to one pole. So, 15 poles. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a proportion. If 1 pole corresponds to 3 wires, then 15 poles would correspond to 15 wires. Wait, that seems right. So, 1 pole is 3 wires, so 5 poles would be 15 wires. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if 1 pole is 3 wires, then 15 wires would be 5 poles.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 poles would be 45 wires. So, that's consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, the ratio is 1:3, so for every pole, there are 3 wires. So, if I have 45 wires, I can divide that by 3 to get the number of poles, which is 15.

Alternatively, I can set up a proportion. Let me try that.

Let me denote the number of poles as P and the number of wires as W. The ratio is P:W = 1:3, so P/W = 1/3.

Given that W = 45, so P = (1/3)*45 = 15.

So, that's another way to look at it.

Alternatively, I can think of it as scaling the ratio. The ratio is 1:3, so for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. So, if I have 45 wires, how many poles? So, 45 divided by 3 is 15. So, 15 poles.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 poles would correspond to 45 wires, maintaining the ratio of 1:3.

Alternatively, if I think of it as a unit rate, 1 pole corresponds to 3 wires, so 1 wire corresponds to 1/3 pole. So, 45 wires would correspond to 45*(1/3) poles, which is 15 poles.

So, all these different ways of thinking about it lead me to the same answer, which is 15 poles.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 15.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.

So, the ratio is 1:3, meaning for every pole, there are 3 wires. So, if I have 45 wires, how many poles? So, 45 divided by 3 is 15. So, 15 poles.

Alternatively, if I think of it as a proportion, P/W = 1/3, so P = W/3. So, P = 45/3 =15.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I think of it as a scaling factor. The ratio is 1:3, so the number of poles is 1/3 of the number of wires. So, 45*(1/3)=15.

So, all these methods lead me to the same answer, which is 15.

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.
