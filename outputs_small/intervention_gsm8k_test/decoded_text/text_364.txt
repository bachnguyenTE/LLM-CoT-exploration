Q: There are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree  School. 43 of them are girls. On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. How many fourth grade boys were at Small Tree  School on Friday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school. There are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, I subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders to find the number of boys.

96 (total fourth-graders) minus 43 (girls) equals 53 (boys).

Next, I know that 5 fourth-grade girls were absent on Friday, but, that seems right. However, the problem doesn't mention any changes in the number of boys being absent. Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys absent on Friday remains the same as the total number of boys.

Since there are 53 boys in total and none are absent, all 53 boys were present on Friday.

To determine how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Number of Fourth-Grade Students:**
   \[
   96 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Number of Fourth-Grade Girls:**
   \[
   43 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. **Number of Fourth-Grade Boys:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} - \text{Number of girls} = 96 - 43 = 53 \text{ boys}
   \]

4. **Absent Students on Friday:**
   - **Girls Absent:** 5
   - **Boys Absent:** The problem doesn't specify the number of boys absent, so we assume none were absent.

5. **Fourth-Grade Boys Present on Friday:**
   \[
   \text{Total boys} - \text{Boys absent} = 53 - 0 = 53 \text{ boys}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{53}
\]
