Q: Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rani, Monic, and Bo, and they all have crabs. The question is asking me to find the total number of crabs they have together. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says, "Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together." Hmm, okay. So, Bo has 40 crabs, and then Monic has 4 fewer than that. Then Rani has 10 more than Monic. So, I need to figure out how many crabs each of them has and then add them all up.

Let me write down what I know:

- Bo has 40 crabs. That's straightforward.

- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, if Bo has 40, Monic must have 40 minus 4. Let me calculate that: 40 - 4 = 36. So, Monic has 36 crabs.

- Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36, Rani must have 36 + 10. Let me do that addition: 36 + 10 = 46. So, Rani has 46 crabs.

Now, to find the total number of crabs, I need to add up the crabs each person has. That would be Bo's 40, Monic's 36, and Rani's 46.

Let me add them one by one. First, 40 + 36. Hmm, 40 + 30 is 70, and then +6 is 76. So, 40 + 36 = 80? Wait, that seems right. 40 + 36 is 76? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
