Q: The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. There are 18 seats in each row. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. How many students were there in the school auditorium?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about the school auditorium with 4 rows of seats. Each row has 18 seats. Then, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. After that, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, and the rest were occupied by the students. I need to find out how many students were there in the auditorium. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows, each with 18 seats. So, I can calculate the total seats by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats per row. That would be 4 times 18. Let me write that down:

Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

Okay, so there are 72 seats in total. Now, one-fourth of these seats were occupied by the administrators. I need to find out how many seats that is. To find one-fourth, I can divide the total number of seats by 4.

Number of seats occupied by administrators = 72 ÷ 4 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. That means the remaining seats are 72 minus 18. Let me calculate that:

Remaining seats after administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Alright, so 54 seats are left after the administrators. Now, one-third of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents. I need to find out how many seats that is. To do this, I can take the remaining seats and divide by 3.

Number of seats occupied by parents = 54 ÷ 3 = 18 seats.

So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents. Now, the rest of the seats must be occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, I can subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.

Number of seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Total seats: 72. Subtract 18 for the administrators, that leaves 54. Then, one-third of 54 is 18, so 54 -18 is 36. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the number of students is 36. Therefore, the answer should be 36 students.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Total seats: 4 rows ×18 seats =72. Correct.

1/4 of 72 is 18. Correct.

72 -18=54. Correct.

1/3 of 54 is 18. Correct.

54 -18=36. Correct.

So, yes, 36 students. Hmm, that seems straightforward. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to verify. Let's see.

Total seats:72.

1/4 occupied by administrators:18.

So, 18 seats are taken by the administrators.

Then, the remaining seats are 54.

1/3 of 54 is 18, so 18 seats are taken by the parents.

Therefore, 54 -18=36 seats are taken by the students.

Yes, same result. So, 36 students.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of fractions of the total seats.

Total seats:72.

1/4 of 72 is 18.

So, 18 seats are taken by the administrators.

Then, the remaining is 72 -18=54.

1/3 of 54 is 18, so 18 seats are taken by the parents.

Therefore, 54 -18=36 seats are taken by the students.

Same answer. So, I think that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of percentages or something else, but, that seems right. I don't think I need to complicate it further.

So, yeah, the number of students is 36.

**Final Answer**
The number of students in the school auditorium is \boxed{36}.

First, we calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats each:

\[
\text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
\]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[
\text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{7
