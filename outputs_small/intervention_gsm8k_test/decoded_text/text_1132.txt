Q: Valerie earns $5000 per month, 1/2 of what her brother earns. If their mother earns twice their combined salary, what's the total amount of money they all have together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Valerie, her brother, and their mother's salaries. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Valerie earns $5000 per month. Hmm, okay, that's straightforward. Then it says she earns half of what her brother earns. So, if Valerie makes $50000, her brother must make twice that amount, right? Because if her brother makes twice as much as Valerie, then her brother's salary is 2 times $50000. Let me write that down.

Valerie's salary: $5000 per month.

Her brother's salary: 2 * Valerie's salary = 2 * $5000 = $10000 per month.

Wait, that seems right. So her brother makes $10000 a month. Let me double-check that. If her brother makes twice as much as Valerie, then yes, 2 * 5000 is 10000. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the next part says their mother earns twice their combined salary. Hmm, so first I need to find their combined salary, which is Valerie's salary plus her brother's salary. Then, the mother's salary is twice that combined amount.

Let me compute their combined salary first. Valerie makes $5000, her brother makes $10000. So combined, that's 5000 + 10000. Let me add those numbers.

5000 + 10000. Let's see, 5000 + 10000. Hmm, 5000 + 10000 is 15000. So their combined salary is $15000 per month.

Now, their mother earns twice that. So, 2 * 15000. Let me compute that. 2 * 15000 is 30000. So, the mother makes $30000 per month.

Alright, so now we have all three salaries:

- Valerie: $5000
- Her brother: $10000
- Their mother: $30000

The question is asking for the total amount of money they all have together. So, I need to add up all three salaries.

Let me add them step by step. First, add Valerie and her brother's salaries: 5000 + 10000. That's 15000. Then, add the mother's salary to that: 15000 + 30000. That should be 45000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify the addition:

5000
+10000
=15000

15000
+30000
=45000

Yes, that adds up correctly. So, altogether, they have $45000 per month.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Valerie makes half of her brother's salary, so her brother makes twice as much. Their combined salary is Valerie's plus her brother's, which is 5000 + 10000 = 15000. The mother makes twice that, so 2 * 15000 = 30000. Adding all three together: 5000 + 10000 +30000 = 45000. Yep, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to figure out her brother's salary first, then compute the combined salary, then double that for the mother, and finally add all three together. It all adds up to $45000.

**Final Answer**
The total amount of money they all have together is \boxed{45000}.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice that amount, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Valerie's salary} = \$5000
\]
\[
\text{Her brother's salary} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10000
\]

Next, we find their combined salary by adding Valerie's and her brother's salaries:

\[
\text{Combined salary} = \$5000 + \$10000 = \$15000
\]

The mother earns twice their combined salary:

\[
\text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \$15000 = \$30000
\]

Finally, we
