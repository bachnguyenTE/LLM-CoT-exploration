Q: Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here: "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to translate the words into a mathematical equation. The problem says, "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs." Let me break that down. "Four times the number of coffee mugs" would be 4 multiplied by the number of coffee mugs. Let me call the number of coffee mugs "x" to make it easier. So, four times that would be 4x.

Then, "eight more than" that means I add 8 to 4x. So, putting it together, that would be 4x + 8. And the problem states that this equals 40. Wait, that seems right. So, the equation is 4x + 8 = 40.

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me write that down:

4x + 8 = 40

Wait, that seems right. So, to solve for x, I should first subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with x. Let me do that:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8

Simplifying both sides, that becomes:

4x = 32

Okay, so now I have 4x equals 32. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 4. Let me write that:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4

Simplifying, that gives:

x = 8

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

If there are 8 coffee mugs, four times that would be 4 * 8 = 32. Then, eight more than that is 32 + 8 = 40. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error.

Starting with the equation: 4x + 8 = 40.

Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32.

Divide both sides by 4: x = 8.

Yes, that all checks out. So, the number of coffee mugs is 8.

I guess that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's straightforward once you translate the words into an equation and then solve step by step.

**Final Answer**
The number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \boxed{8}.

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. We need to find the number of coffee mugs.

First, we translate the words into a mathematical equation. Let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs. The equation is:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

Thus, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \(\boxed{8}\).
