Q: A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a food caterer preparing hot dogs for a party. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, the problem says that there are 36 guests. Most people would only eat one hotdog, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, most people would only eat one, but, that seems right. Hmm, maybe I need to read that again. "While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs." Okay, so, most people would only eat one, but, that seems right. So, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two each. So, half of 36 is 18, so he prepared enough for 18 guests to have two each. So, that would be 18 times 2, which is 36 hotdogs. So, he prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 guests, each having two. So, that's 36 hotdogs for 18 people, each having two. So, that's 36 hotdogs for 18 people, each having two. So, 18 people times 2 is 36. So, that's 36 hotdogs. So, he prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 people, each having two. So, that's 36 hotdogs. So, okay, so he prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 people, each having two. So, that's 36 hotdogs. So, okay, so he prepared 36 hotdogs for 18 people, each having two. So, that's 36 hotdogs.
