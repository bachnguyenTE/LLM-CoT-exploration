Q: Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Roger spent on buy coffee and a donut. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says that Roger buys coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound. But, that seems right. Then, he had to buy a more expensive brand because his favorite was out. The more expensive one costs 20% more than the normal brand. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the price of the more expensive brand.

Let me write that down. The normal price is $5 per pound. The more expensive brand is 20% more. So, to find the increased price, I can calculate 20% of $5 and then add that to the original price. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So, 0.20 multiplied by $5. Let me do that: 0.20 * 5 = 1. So, the extra cost is $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. Got that.

Now, Roger is buying a week's worth of coffee. A week has 7 days, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee. Since each pound is $6, the total cost for the coffee would be 7 * $6. Let me calculate that: 7 * 6 = 42. So, the coffee costs $42.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 7 pounds at $6 each is 42. Okay, so the coffee is $42.

He also decided to buy a donut for $2. So, I need to add that to the total cost. So, $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44. So, altogether, he spent $44.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. 

1. Normal price: $5 per pound.
2. More expensive brand is 20% more: 20% of 5 is 1, so 5 + 1 = 6 per pound.
3. He buys a week's worth, which is 7 pounds: 7 * 6 = 42.
4. Donut is $2: 42 + 2 = 44.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the total cost is $44.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. For example, is the 20% increase on the total cost or per pound? The problem says "20% more since his favorite brand was sold out." So, it's 20% more on the normal price, which is $5. So, 20% of 5 is 1, so 5 + 1 is 6. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if it were 20% more on the total amount, it would be different, but, that seems right. So, 20% more on the normal price, so 6 per pound.

So, 7 pounds at 6 is 42, plus 2 for the donut is 44. So, the total cost is $44.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total cost for everything is \boxed{44} dollars.

Roger buys coffee at a normal price of $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 

First, we calculate the increased price of the more expensive brand:
\[
20\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.20 \times 5 = \$1
\]
Thus, the price of the more expensive brand is:
\[
\$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound}
\]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds. The cost for 7 pounds of coffee is:
\[
7 \times \$6 = \$42
\]

He also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for everything is:
\[
\$42 + \$2 = \$44
\]

The total cost for everything is \boxed{44} dollars.
