Q: Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls for breakfast. After feeding her 6 children with one each, she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. How many pieces of rolls did she feed to the chickens?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Sherman and her bread rolls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, she made a dozen bread rolls. A dozen is 12, right? So, she has 12 rolls in total.

Then, she feeds her 6 children with one each. So, each child gets one roll. That means she's used up 6 rolls for the children. Let me write that down:

Total rolls = 12
Rolls given to children = 6

So, the remaining rolls after feeding the children would be 12 minus 6. Let me calculate that: 12 - 6 = 6. So, there are 6 rolls left after feeding the children.

Now, the problem says she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens. Hmm, okay. So, each of those 6 rolls is being cut into 8 pieces. I need to find out how many pieces she fed to the chickens.

So, if each roll is broken into 8 pieces, then 6 rolls would have 6 times 8 pieces. Let me write that as a multiplication:

Number of remaining rolls = 6
Pieces per roll = 8

Total pieces for chickens = 6 * 8

Let me compute that: 6 times 8 is 48. So, 48 pieces.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. She started with 12 rolls, used 6 for the kids, so 6 left. Each of those 6 is cut into 8, so 6*8=48. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the answer should be 48 pieces.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach it. Maybe by calculating how many pieces each child got and then the chickens. But, that seems right. Each child got 1 roll, which is 8 pieces? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
