Q: Lee rears only sheep and geese on his farm.  If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, how many sheep live on Lee's farm?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Lee rears only sheep and geese on his farm. The total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20. I need to find out how many sheep are on the farm. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that both sheep and geese have one head each, right? So, if there are a total of 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total on the farm. That makes sense because each animal has one head. So, if I let the number of sheep be S and the number of geese be G, then I can write the equation:

S + G = 20

That's straightforward. Now, the next piece of information is about the number of legs. Sheep have 4 legs each, and geese have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs would be 4 times the number of sheep plus 2 times the number of geese. The problem says the total number of legs is 70, so I can write another equation:

4S + 2G = 70

Now, I have a system of two equations:

1. S + G = 20
2. 4S + 2G = 70

I need to solve this system to find the value of S, which is the number of sheep. Let me think about how to solve this. I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here because the coefficients are manageable.

Looking at the first equation, S + G = 20, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for G:

G = 20 - S

Now, I can substitute this expression for G into the second equation. So, replacing G in the second equation with (20 - S):

4S + 2(20 - S) = 70

Let me simplify this step by step. First, distribute the 2 into the parentheses:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Now, combine like terms. 4S - 2S is 2S, so:

2S + 40 = 70

Next, subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with S:

2S = 70 - 40
2S = 30

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for S:

S = 15

So, according to this, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

If there are 15 sheep, then the number of geese would be 20 - 15 = 5 geese.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Sheep have 4 legs each, so 15 sheep would have 15 * 4 = 60 legs. Geese have 2 legs each, so 5 geese would have 5 * 2 = 10 legs. Adding those together, 60 + 10 = 70 legs, which matches the given total. So, that checks out.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using ratios or something else.

Alternatively, I could think about the difference in legs between sheep and geese. Since each sheep has 2 more legs than a goose, the extra legs would account for the difference in the number of animals.

But, that seems right. Let me try that approach too.

If all 20 animals were geese, they would have 20 * 2 = 40 legs. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
