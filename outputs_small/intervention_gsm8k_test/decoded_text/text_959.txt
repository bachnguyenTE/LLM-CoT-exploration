Q: Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.  After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag.  The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?

Okay, so Coach brought a bag of basketballs to practice, dumped them all out, and then Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey picked them up. They all went over to the bag and carried them back. The problem says that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey. It also mentions that Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls. We need to find the total number of balls the coach brought to practice.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let's figure out how many balls each person carried. It says Jason carried 2 balls. Then, Jordan carried twice as many as Jason. So if Jason has 2, Jordan must have 2 times 2, which is 4. Got that. Then, Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey. So if Jason has 2, then Jeffrey must have half of that, right? So 2 divided by 2 is 1. So Jeffrey carried 1 ball.

Wait, that seems right. So let me write that out:

- Jason: 2 balls
- Jordan: 2 * 2 = 4 balls
- Jeffrey: 2 / 2 = 1 ball

So, adding them all up: 2 (Jason) + 4 (Jordan) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls in total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Jason carried 2, Jordan carried twice as much, so 4. Then, since Jason carried twice as much as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half of 2, which is 1. So 2 + 4 + 1 is 7. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So the total number of balls is 7. So the answer should be 7.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. If Jason carried 2, Jordan carried 4, and Jeffrey carried 1, so 2+4+1=7. Yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of ratios. Since Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, and Jason twice as many as Jeffrey, the ratio of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey is 4:2:1. So, the total ratio parts are 4+2+1=7. So, if each part is 1 ball, then total is 7. So that's another way to see it.

So, yeah, 7 is the total number of balls. So the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
The total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \boxed{7}.

Coach brought a bag of basketballs to practice and dumped them all out. Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey picked up and carried all the balls. It was given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls.

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
- Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \(2 / 2 = 1\) ball.

Adding up the number of balls each person carried:
- Jason: 2 balls
- Jordan: 4 balls
- Jeffrey: 1 ball

Total number of balls: \(2 + 4 +1 = 7\).

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\).
