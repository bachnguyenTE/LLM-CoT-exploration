Q: Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. How many hours does Bruce work in all these three days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Bruce works from Tuesday to Thursday. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, on Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours. That's straightforward. So, Tuesday = 5 hours.

Then, on Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Hmm, so if Tuesday is 5 hours, then Wednesday would be 2 times 5. Let me write that down: Wednesday = 2 * Tuesday. So, Wednesday = 2 * 5 = 10 hours. Wait, that seems right. So, Wednesday is 10 hours.

Now, on Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, Thursday = Wednesday - 2 hours. Since Wednesday is 10 hours, Thursday would be 10 - 2 = 8 hours. Let me make sure that makes sense. If he works twice as much as Tuesday, that's 10, and then subtract 2, so yes, 8 hours on Thursday.

Now, to find the total hours he works from Tuesday to Thursday, I need to add up the hours from each day. So, that would be Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday. Plugging in the numbers: 5 + 10 + 8.

Let me add them up. 5 + 10 is 15, and then 15 + 8 is 13. Wait, that seems right. So, 5 + 10 is 15, and 15 + 8 is 23. So, total hours are 23.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Tuesday is 5, Wednesday is 10, Thursday is 8. 5 + 10 is 15, and 15 + 8 is 23. Yeah, that adds up. So, the total hours Bruce works in these three days is 23 hours.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 23 hours.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hours Bruce works is \boxed{23}.

Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours. 

To find the total number of hours Bruce works from Tuesday to Thursday, we add the hours from each day:
\[
5 + 10 + 8 = 23
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works is \(\boxed{23}\).
