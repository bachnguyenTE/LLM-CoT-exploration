Q: Joey has 214 points before his turn in Scrabble. He scores 26 points. Then Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. By how many points is Joey now winning?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Joey and Marcy scoring points in Scrabble. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Joey has 214 points before his turn. Then he scores 26 points. So, I think I need to add those two amounts together to find out how many points Joey has after his turn. Let me write that down:

214 (Joey's initial points) + 26 (his score) = ?

Hmm, 214 plus 26. Let me do the addition. 214 plus 20 is 234, and then plus 6 is 240. Wait, that seems right. So Joey now has 240 points.

Then, the problem mentions Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. So, I need to add Marcy's points to her current points. Let me write that:

225 (Marcy's initial points) + 10 (her score) = ?

Adding 225 and 10. That's straightforward. 225 plus 10 is 225, plus 1 is 226. So Marcy now has 226 points.

Wait, that seems right. So after both of them have scored, Joey has 240 and Marcy has 226. The question is asking by how many points Joey is now winning. Hmm, I need to figure out the difference between their points now.

So, I think I need to subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points. That way, I can see how much more Joey has than Marcy. Let me do that:

240 (Joey's points) - 226 (Marcy's points) = ?

Let me subtract 226 from 240. Let's break it down. 240 minus 200 is 44, and then minus 26 more. Wait, that seems right. So 240 minus 200 is 40, and then 40 minus 26 is 34. So, 240 minus 226 is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my subtraction again. 240 minus 226. If I take away 200 from 240, I get 40. Then, I need to subtract 26 from 40. 40 minus 26 is 14. So, yes, 14 points.

So, Joey is now winning by 14 points. That makes sense because he scored more points than Marcy. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Joey starts with 214 points.
2. He scores 26 points, so 214 + 26 = 240.
3. Marcy starts with 225 points.
4. She scores 10 points, so 225 + 10 = 235.
5. Wait, that seems right. 225 plus 10 is 235, not 226. Wait, that seems right. So Marcy has 235 points.
6. Then, the difference is 240 - 235 = 5. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
