Q: Shannon makes her own madeleine cookies and eats 2 a night as a treat.  She wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days by storing them in the freezer. Her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies.  How many dozens of cookies will she need to make so she has enough for 30 days?

Okay, so Shannon wants to make enough madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, she eats 2 cookies a night, right? So, if she wants to have enough for 30 days, I need to figure out how many cookies she needs in total.

Alright, so if she eats 2 cookies each night, then over 30 days, that would be 2 cookies multiplied by 30 days. Let me write that down: 2 cookies/day * 30 days. Hmm, 2 times 30 is... 60. So, she needs 60 cookies in total.

Wait, that seems right. 2 times 30 is 60. Yeah, that makes sense. So, she needs 60 cookies for 30 days.

Now, her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies each time she makes them. A dozen is 12, so each batch she makes gives her 12 cookies. So, how many batches does she need to make to get 60 cookies?

To find out how many batches, I can divide the total number of cookies she needs by the number of cookies each batch makes. So, 60 cookies divided by 12 cookies per batch. Let me calculate that: 60 ÷ 12. Hmm, 12 goes into 60 five times because 12 times 5 is 60. So, she needs to make 5 batches.

Wait, that seems right. Each batch is 12 cookies, so 5 batches would be 5 times 12, which is 60. Yeah, that adds up. So, she needs to make 5 batches of cookies.

But, that seems right. So, the question is asking how many dozens of cookies she needs to make. Each batch is 1 dozen, so if she makes 5 batches, she needs to make 5 dozens.

So, the answer is 5 dozens of cookies.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check. She eats 2 cookies a night, 30 days. 2 times 30 is 60. Each batch is 12, so 60 divided by 12 is 30 batches. Wait, that seems right.
