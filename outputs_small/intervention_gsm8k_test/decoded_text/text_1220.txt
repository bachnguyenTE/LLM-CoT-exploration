Q: Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. How long is the longer piece?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long, and he wants to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is four times longer than the shorter piece. Hmm, I need to figure out how long the longer piece is. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the problem. There's a board that's 40 feet in total length. When Ian makes a cut, he'll end up with two separate pieces. One piece is longer than the other, and the longer one is four times as long as the shorter one. So, if I can figure out the lengths of both pieces, I can find the answer.

Let me assign some variables to make this easier. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is, let's see, 'x' feet. Then, since the longer piece is four times as long, its length would be '4x' feet. That makes sense because if the shorter piece is x, multiplying it by 4 gives the longer piece.

Now, the total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces. So, the shorter piece plus the longer piece should equal 40 feet. In equation form, that would be:

x + 4x = 40

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, x + 4x is 5x. So, 5x = 40.

To find the value of x, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, x = 40 / 5. Let me calculate that. 40 divided by 5 is 8. So, x = 8.

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Then, the longer piece is 4 times that, which is 4 * 8. Let me compute that. 4 times 8 is 32. So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If the shorter piece is 8 feet and the longer is 32 feet, adding them together should give 40 feet. 8 + 32 is indeed 40. So, that checks out.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the board is 40 feet, cut into two pieces. The longer piece is four times the shorter. So, if the shorter is 8, the longer is 32, which is four times 8. So, 8 + 32 is 40. That's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the longer piece is 32 feet. So, the answer is 32 feet.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else.

So, the ratio of the shorter piece to the longer piece is 1:4. So, the total parts are 1 + 4 = 5 parts. Each part is equal to 40 divided by 5, which is 8. So, each part is 8 feet. Therefore, the shorter piece is 1 part, which is 8 feet, and the longer piece is 4 parts, which is 32 feet. So, same result.

So, that seems consistent. So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 32 feet.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the longer piece is 32 feet.

Wait, that seems right. So, yeah, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, yeah, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The longer piece is \boxed{32} feet long.

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He makes a cut to create two pieces, where the longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece. Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces:
\[
x + 4x = 40
\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[
5x = 40
\]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

Thus, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, and the length of the longer piece is:
\[
4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
\]

Therefore, the longer piece is \boxed{32} feet long.
