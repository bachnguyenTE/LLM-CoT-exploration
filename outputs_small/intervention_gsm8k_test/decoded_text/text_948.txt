Q: Cayley markets various newspapers to get a commission on each copy sold. He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Cayley selling newspapers and earning a commission. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, first, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets a commission on each copy. Specifically, he gets 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. The question is asking how much commission he will earn in total from selling 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and each copy of Wall Street Journal costs $15.

Wait, that seems right. So, he sells 6 copies of the New York Times, each costing $5, and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal, each costing $15. He gets 10% on the New York Times and 8% on Wall Street Journal. So, I need to calculate the total commission he gets from both newspapers.

Let me break this down. First, I should calculate the total sales for each newspaper, then find the commission from each, and finally add them together to get the total commission.

Starting with the New York Times. He sells 6 copies, each costing $5. So, the total sales for the New York Times would be 6 multiplied by $5. Let me write that down:

Total sales for NY Times = 6 * $5.

Calculating that, 6 times 5 is 30. So, the total sales for the New York Times are $30.

Now, Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, the commission from the New York Times would be 10% of $30. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, 10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form. So, I can multiply 0.10 by $30.

Commission from NY Times = 0.10 * $30.

Let me compute that. 0.10 times 30 is 3. So, the commission from the New York Times is $3.

Okay, moving on to Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 copies, each costing $15. So, the total sales for Wall Street Journal would be 10 multiplied by $15.

Total sales for W/S J = 10 * $15.

Wait, that seems right. 10 times 15 is 150. So, the total sales for Wall Street Journal are $150.

Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of Wall Street Journal. So, the commission from Wall Street Journal would be 8% of $150. Again, 8% is 0.08 in decimal form. So, I can multiply 0.08 by $150.

Commission from W/S J = 0.08 * $150.

Calculating that, 0.08 times 150. Hmm, 0.08 times 100 is 8, and 0.08 times 50 is 4, so 8 + 4 is 12. So, the commission from Wall Street Journal is $12.

Now, to find the total commission, I need to add the commission from the New York Times and the commission from Wall Street Journal together.

Total commission = Commission from NY Times + Commission from W/S J.

Plugging in the numbers, that's $3 + $12.

So, $3 plus $12 is $15.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, New York Times: 6 copies at $5 each is 6*5=30, which is $30. 10% of 30 is 3. That seems correct.

Then, Wall Street Journal: 10 copies at $15 each is 10*15=150. 8% of 150 is 12. That also seems correct.

Adding 3 and 12 gives 15. So, the total commission is $15.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total sales first and then apply the overall commission rate? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total sales for both newspapers and then apply the overall commission.

Wait, that seems right. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same answer.

Total sales for NY Times: 6 copies * $5 = $30.

Total sales for W/S J: 10
