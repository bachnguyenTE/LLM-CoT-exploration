Q: Judy teaches 5 dance classes, every day, on the weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday.  If each class has 15 students and she charges $15.00 per student, how much money does she make in 1 week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Judy makes in one week. Let me break this down step by step. First, let me understand the problem.

Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day. These are on the weekdays, which are Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days. On Saturday, she also teaches, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, in total, how many classes does she teach in a week?

Let me count: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. That's 6 days a week. So, 5 classes each day for 6 days. Hmm, okay, so 5 classes/day multiplied by 6 days. Let me write that down.

5 classes/day * 6 days = 30 classes in a week.

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 6 is 30. Yeah, 30 dance classes in a week.

Now, each class has 15 students. So, for each class, Judy has 15 students. So, to find the total number of students she teaches in a week, I need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students per class.

So, 30 classes * 15 students/class. Let me calculate that.

30 * 15. Hmm, 30 times 10 is 300, and 30 times 5 is 150, so 330. Wait, that seems right. 30*15 is 450? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
