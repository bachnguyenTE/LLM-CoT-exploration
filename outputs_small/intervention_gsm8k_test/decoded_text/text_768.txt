Q: In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more. How many books have they read altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed and Ezra read 300 books, I can set up the equation 2A = 300, where A represents the number of books Ahmed read. Solving for A gives A = 150.

Next, I'll calculate how many books Ezra will read in total. Ezra has already read 300 books and decided to read 150 more, so the total number of books he will read is 300 + 150 = 480.

Finally, to find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed have read altogether, I'll add the number of books each has read: 480 (Ezra) +150 (Ahmed) = 630.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of books Ezra and Ahmed have read altogether.

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   
   - It's given that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.
   - Therefore, \( 2A = 300 \) (since Ezra read 300 books).
   
   \[
   A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   
   So, Ahmed read **150 books**.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Ezra will read:**
   
   - Ezra has already read 300 books and decided to read 150 more.
   - Total books read by Ezra = 300 + 150 = **480 books**.

3. **Find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:**
   
   - Total books = Books read by Ezra + Books read by Ahmed
   - Total books = 480 + 150 = **630 books**

\[
\boxed{630}
\]
