Q: On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Clara and Sheila buying pomegranates on two different days. I need to figure out the difference in the final prices they paid. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at what happened on Tuesday. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. Hmm, so that's 20 multiplied by $20. Let me write that down: 20 * $20. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 times 20 is... 400? Wait, that seems right. 20 times 20 is 400. So, Clara spent $400 on buying the pomegranates on Tuesday.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 20 pomegranates at $20 each is 20*20, which is 400. Yeah, that's correct. So, $400.00? Wait, that seems right. So, $400.00? Wait, that seems right. So, $400.00? Wait, that seems right. So, $400? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 20 times 20 is 400, so $400.00? Wait, that seems right. So, $400.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, Clara spent $400.00 on Tuesday.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 pomegranates at $20 each is 20*20, which is 400. So, $400.00. So, that's correct.

Then, on Tuesday, she got $2 off because she had a voucher. So, she saved $2. So, the total she paid is $400.00 minus $2.00, which is $400.00 minus $2.00 is $398.00. So, she paid $398.00 on Tuesday.

Wait, that seems right. So, $400.00 minus $2.00 is $398.00. So, that's correct.

So, on Tuesday, Clara paid $398.00 for 20 pomegranates.

Now, moving on to the next day. The price went up to $30 per fruit, but, that seems right. So, the price per fruit went up to $30. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the price per fruit went up to $30.

But, that seems right. So, the next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the price per fruit went up to $30.

But, that seems right. So, the price per fruit went up to $30, but, that seems right. So, the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost.

So, Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. So, she bought 20 pomegranates, and she got a 10% discount on the total cost.

So, let's figure out how much she paid.

First, the price per fruit is $30, but, that seems right. So, 20 pomegranates at $30 each is 20*30. Let me compute that: 20*30 is 660. So, the total cost before discount is $660.00.

But, that seems right. So, 20*30 is 660. So, $660.00.

But, that seems right. So, the total cost before discount is $660.00.

But, that seems right. So, the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, 10% off of $660.00.

So, 10% of $660.00 is... Let me compute that. 10% is 0.10 times 660. So, 0.10*660 is 66.00. So, 10% of 660 is 66.00. So, 10% is 66.00 plus 1% of 660.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, 1% of 660 is 6
