Q: Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean fill?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Jean starts with 30 lollipops.

He eats 2 of them, so the remaining lollipops are 30 minus 2, which equals 28.

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags he can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag: 28 divided by 2 equals 14.

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Number of Lollipops:**
   Jean starts with **30 lollipops**.

2. **Lollipops Eaten:**
   Jean eats **2 lollipops**.
   
   \[
   30 \text{ lollipops} - 2 \text{ lollipops} = 28 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

3. **Number of Lollipops per Bag:**
   Jean wants to package **2 lollipops** in each bag.

4. **Calculating the Number of Bags:**
   To find out how many bags Jean can fill, divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag.

   \[
   \frac{28 \text{ lollipops}}{2 \text{ lollipops per bag}} = 14 \text{ bags}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
