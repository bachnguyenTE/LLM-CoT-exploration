Q: Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. If Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, what's the average speed he was traveling?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. I need to find his average speed. Hmm, average speed is usually total distance divided by total time, right? Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out the total distance Sid traveled. He went 110 miles initially and then another 140 miles. So, I can add those two distances together. Let me write that down: 110 + 140. Hmm, 110 plus 140. Let me do the math step by step. 110 plus 100 is 121, and then plus 140 is... wait, that seems right. 110 + 140 is 254 miles. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 110 + 140. 100 + 140 is 154, and then the 10 is left, so 154 +1 is 255? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 110 +140 is 255 miles. Wait, that seems right. Let me add it again: 110 +140. 100 +140 is 254, plus 1 is 255. Yeah, that's correct. So total distance is 255 miles.

Now, I need the total time he spent traveling. He traveled the first part in 2 hours and the second part in 3 hours. So, total time is 2 +3, which is 5 hours. So, total time is 5 hours.

So, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, that would be 255 miles divided by 5 hours. Let me compute that. 255 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 25 five times, so 5 times 50 is 250, and then 5 goes into 5 once. So, 50. So, 255 divided by 5 is 51. Wait, that seems right. 5 times 51 is 255. Yeah, that's correct.

So, average speed is 51 miles per hour. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, total distance: 110 +140 is 250, plus 5 is 255. Total time: 2 +3 is 5. 255 divided by 5 is 51. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, Sid's average speed is 51 mph. Hmm, okay, that seems straightforward. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Let me just double-check the addition: 110 +140 is 250, plus 5 is 255. Yeah, that's correct. And 255 divided by 5 is 51. So, yeah, that's the answer.

I think that's it. So, the average speed is 51 mph.

**Final Answer**
The average speed Sid was traveling is \boxed{51} miles per hour.

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance and the total time.

First, we add the distances:
\[
110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the times:
\[
2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\frac{255 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 51 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, the average speed Sid was traveling is \boxed{51} miles per hour.
