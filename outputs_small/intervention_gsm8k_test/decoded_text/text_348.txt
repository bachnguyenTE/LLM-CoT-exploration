Q: A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a factory that used to make tractors but, that seems right. Now they make silos. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.

First, when they used to make tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Hmm, so I need to calculate their daily earnings back then. That should be straightforward. If they sold 10 tractors and each one gave them $100, then their daily income was 10 times 100. Let me write that down:

Daily earnings before = Number of tractors sold per day × Price per tractor
= 10 × 100
= $1000 per day.

Okay, so they made $1000 a day before. Now, they're making silos. They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. I need to find out their new daily earnings. So, similar to before, it's the number of silos sold multiplied by the price per silo.

Daily earnings now = Number of silos sold per day × Price per silo
= 5 × 220
= $1100 per day.

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 220 is 1100. So, they make $1100 a day now.

The question is asking for the percentage increase in their daily earnings. So, I need to find how much more they're making now compared to before, expressed as a percentage.

To find the percentage increase, I remember the formula:

Percentage increase = [(New value - Old value)/Old value] × 100%

So, plugging in the numbers:

Percentage increase = [(1100 - 1000)/1000] × 100%

Let me compute the numerator first: 1100 minus 1000 is 100.

So, 100 divided by 1000 is 0.1.

Then, multiplying by 100% gives 10%.

Wait, that seems right. So, they're making 10% more per day now.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, daily earnings before: 10 tractors × $100 = $1000. That's correct.

Daily earnings now: 5 silos × $2220. Wait, that seems right. 5 times 220 is 1100. So, $1100.

Difference: 1100 - 1000 = 100.

Percentage increase: (100 / 1000) × 100% = 10%. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 10%.

**Final Answer**
The factory is making \boxed{10\%} more per day now.

The factory used to make tractors and sold 10 tractors a day, making $100 per tractor. Their daily earnings before were calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Daily earnings before} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the factory makes silos and sells 5 silos a day, making $220 per silo. Their new daily earnings are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Daily earnings now} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the percentage increase in daily earnings, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New value} - \text{Old value}}{\text{Old value}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{11100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\%
\]

Thus, the factory is making \boxed{10\%} more per day now.
