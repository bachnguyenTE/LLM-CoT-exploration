Q: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account.  He loses 10 bills while getting home.  After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank account. Hmm, that means he took out some number of $10 bills, right? Let me see, if each bill is $10, then the total amount he took out is $1000. So, how many $10 bills is that? Well, $1000 divided by $10 per bill is 100 bills. So, he took out 100 bills. 

Now, he loses 10 bills while getting home. So, he started with 100 bills and lost 10 of them. That means he has 100 minus 10, which is 100 bills left. Wait, that seems right. So, he has 100 bills after losing 10. 

Then, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Hmm, so he has 100 bills, and he uses half of them. Half of 100 is 50. So, he uses 50 bills to pay for something. That means he has 100 minus 50, which is 50 bills left. 

Okay, so now he has 50 bills. Then, Thomas then triples his money. Hmm, tripling his money. So, if he has 50 bills, and each bill is $10, that's $50. Tripling that would be 3 times $50, which is $150. So, he now has $150. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he had 50 bills, used half to pay for something, so he had 50 bills left, then he tripled his money, so he had $150. 

Then, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. So, he has $150, and each bill is $5. So, how many 5 dollar bills is that? Well, $150 divided by $5 per bill is 30 bills. So, he has 30 bills. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. He withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. So, $1000 divided by $10 per bill is 100 bills. That's correct.

2. He loses 10 bills. So, 100 minus 10 is 90 bills. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
