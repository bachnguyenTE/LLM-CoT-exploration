Q: Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed.  At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Laurel and her baby outfits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits that her child no longer needed. Hmm, so that's like a set of clothes that she doesn't need anymore. So, she already has 24 outfits from her friend. Got that.

Then, at her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits. Hmm, okay. So, if her friend gave her 24, twice that would be 24 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down: 24 * 2 = 48. So, she got 48 more outfits at the baby shower. 

After that, her mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. So, now we have to add those 15 to the previous total. Let me add that: 48 + 15. Hmm, 48 plus 10 is 49, and then plus 5 is 54. So, that would make the total number of outfits 54.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. She started with 24, then got 48 more, so 24 + 48 is 72. Then, she got 15 more, so 72 +15 is 87. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
