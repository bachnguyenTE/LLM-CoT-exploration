Q: Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total number of legs for the spiders. There are 80 spiders, each with 8 legs. Multiplying these together gives 80 multiplied by 8, which equals 640 legs.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of legs for the insects. There are 90 insects, each with 6 legs. Multiplying these together gives 90 multiplied by 6, which equals 540 legs.

Then, I'll calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 of them, each with 10 legs. Multiplying these together gives 3 multiplied by10, which equals 30 legs.

Finally, I'll add up all the legs from the spiders, insects, and invertebrates to find the total number of legs Jake sees. Adding 640, 540, and 30 together gives a total of 1,218 legs.

To determine the total number of legs Jake sees at the Museum of Entomology, we'll calculate the legs from each category separately and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - **Number of spiders:** 80
   - **Legs per spider:** 8
   - **Total legs from spiders:** \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) legs

2. **Insects:**
   - **Number of insects:** 90
   - **Legs per insect:** 6
   - **Total legs from insects:** \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \) legs

3. **Rare Mutant Invertebrates:**
   - **Number of invertebrates:** 3
   - **Legs per invertebrate:** 10
   - **Total legs from invertebrates:** \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) legs

4. **Total Legs:**
   - **Sum of all legs:** \( 640 + 540 + 30 = 1,\!218 \) legs

\[
\boxed{1,\!218}
\]
