Q: Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. How many shells does Kylie collect on Tuesday?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Kylie and Robert collecting shells at the beach. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. Hmm, okay, so Robert has 20 shells on Monday. That means Kylie must have collected 5 more than that. Let me write that down.

Robert on Monday: 20 shells  
Kylie on Monday: 20 + 5 = 25 shells

Alright, so on Monday, Robert has 20 and Kylie has 25. Got that.

Now, the next part says that on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand what "2 times more" means. Is it 2 times as many as she had on Monday, or is it 2 times the total she had over the two days? 

I think it's the former. So, if she collected 25 on Monday, then on Tuesday, she collects 2 times that amount. Let me calculate that.

Kylie on Tuesday: 2 times Monday's amount = 2 * 25 = 50 shells

Wait, that seems right. So, 2 times 25 is 50. So, on Tuesday, Kylie collects 50 shells.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she had 25 on Monday, then 2 times more would be 25 + (2 * 25) = 25 + 50 = 75? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
