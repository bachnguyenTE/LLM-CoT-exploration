Q: Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia’s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Mia's restaurant. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function. So, that's a total of 42 + 15 = 57 people coming. Hmm, okay, so 57 people in total.

Now, the restaurant has regular chairs and high chairs. It mentions that there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Hmm, so if I let the number of high chairs be H, then the number of regular chairs would be 5H. Got it.

The problem also states that there are 8 high chairs. So, H = 8. That means the number of regular chairs is 5 times 8, which is 40. So, 44 regular chairs and 8 high chairs. Let me check that: 5 times 8 is 40, yes, that's correct.

So, total chairs in the restaurant right now would be the sum of high chairs and regular chairs. That's 8 + 44 = 52 chairs. Wait, that seems right. 8 high chairs and 44 regular chairs make 52 chairs in total.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 8 high chairs and 44 regular chairs. So, 52 chairs in total. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 8 high chairs and 44 regular chairs. So, 52 chairs.
