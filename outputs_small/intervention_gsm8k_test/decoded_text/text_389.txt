Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of buying tickets for all 9 rides at the carnival. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the costs involved. There are two options: buying a ride bracelet or buying ride tickets. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides. On the other hand, each ride ticket costs $2, and each ride ticket allows you to go on one ride. Since there are 9 rides in total, buying individual tickets would cost 9 times $2.

So, let me calculate the cost for each option.

Starting with the ride bracelet: It's straightforward. The bracelet itself costs $30, and it gives you all 9 rides for free. So, if David buys the bracelet, he doesn't have to spend any money on the rides, right? He just pays $30 for the bracelet and gets all the rides.

Now, let's calculate the cost if David buys ride tickets. Each ride ticket is $2, and he needs 9 of them because there are 9 rides. So, the total cost for tickets would be 9 multiplied by $2. Let me write that out:

9 rides * $2 per ride = $18.

So, if David buys individual tickets, he spends $18 for all 9 rides. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 9 times 2 is 18. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the question is asking how much money David saves by buying the bracelet instead of buying the tickets. So, we need to find the difference between the cost of the tickets and the cost of the bracelet.

So, the cost of tickets is $18, and the cost of the bracelet is $30. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
