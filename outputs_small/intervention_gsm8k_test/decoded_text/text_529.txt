Q: Tom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?

Okay, so I have this problem here: Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. The question is asking how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he decided not to buy the headphone set. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Tom bought two items: a CD and a headphone set. The total amount he spent was $48. The CD cost $4. So, I think I can find out how much the headphone set cost by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount.

Let me write that down:

Total cost = Cost of CD + Cost of headphone set

So, $48 = $4 + Cost of headphone set.

To find the cost of the headphone set, I can subtract $4 from $48.

$48 - $4 = $44.

So, the headphone set costs $44. Got that.

Now, the question is asking how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set. So, if he doesn't buy the headphone set, he can only buy CDs. Since each CD costs $4, I need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with the $48 he spent on both items.

Wait, that seems right. So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have only spent $48 on CDs. So, the number of CDs he could buy without the headphone set would be $48 divided by the cost per CD, which is $4.

Let me calculate that:

Number of CDs without headphone set = Total amount / Cost per CD
Number of CDs without headphone set = $48 / $4
Number of CDs without headphone set = 12.

So, without the headphone set, Tom could have bought 12 CDs. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
