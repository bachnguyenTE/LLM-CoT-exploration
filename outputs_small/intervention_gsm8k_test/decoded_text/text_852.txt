Q: A basket of green food costs $25 and a basket of red food costs $18. If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food, how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of one basket of green food and one basket of red food.

A basket of green food costs $25, and a basket of red food costs $18.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for three baskets of green food and three baskets of red food without any discounts.

For the green food: 3 baskets × $25 = $75.

For the red food: 3 baskets × $18 = $54.

Adding these together gives the total cost before any discounts: $75 + $54 = $129.

Since there's a $2 discount for each basket of red food, the total discount is 3 baskets × $2 = $6.

Subtracting the total discount from the initial total cost: $129 - $6 = $123.

Therefore, the total amount to be paid is $123.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of one basket of each food:**
   - **Green Food:** \$25 per basket
   - **Red Food:** \$18 per basket

2. **Calculate the total cost for 3 baskets of each food:**
   - **Green Food Total:** 
     \[
     3 \text{ baskets} \times \$25/\text{basket} = \$75
     \]
   - **Red Food Total:**
     \[
     3 \text{ baskets} \times \$18/\text{basket} = \$54
     \]

3. **Find the total cost before any discounts:**
   \[
   \$75 + \$54 = \$129
   \]

4. **Apply the discount for each basket of red food:**
   - **Total Discount:** 
     \[
     3 \text{ baskets} \times \$2/\text{basket} = \$6
     \]
   - **Total Cost After Discount:**
     \[
     \$129 - \$6 = \$123
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{123}
\]
