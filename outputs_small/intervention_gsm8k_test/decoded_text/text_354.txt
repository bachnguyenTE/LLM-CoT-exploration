Q: Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Annabelle wants to buy a phone that costs $4000. She already has $80 saved up. Hmm, that's a start, but, that seems right. Let me check: $400 minus $80 is $320. So she still needs $320 more. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure.

Alright, so she has $80 saved. The phone is $400. So, subtracting her savings from the total cost: 400 - 80. Let me do that math. 400 minus 80 is 360. So, she needs $360 more. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is $360. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
