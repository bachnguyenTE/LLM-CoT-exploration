Q: Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many steps Elliott took during his jog. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Hmm, so that means he walked to school and came back, right? So that's two walks, each contributing half of his total steps. So, half of 10,000 is 5,000 steps. So, he did 5,000 steps to school and 5,000 steps back home. That adds up to 10,00 steps for the school walks.

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, that's an additional 1,000 steps. So, so far, he's done 5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 steps. Let me add those up. 5,000 + 5,000 is 10,00, and then plus 1,000 is 12,000 steps.

Wait, that seems right. So, he's done 12,000 steps so far. Then, he went for a short jog around the block. After that jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. So, the total steps he was supposed to do is 10,000. He did 12,000 steps before the jog, and then he had 2,000 left after the jog. So, that means the jog must have been the difference between the total steps and the steps he did before the jog, minus the remaining steps.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write this down.

Total steps needed: 10,000

Steps done before jog: 12,000
