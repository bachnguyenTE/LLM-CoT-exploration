Q: Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total amount of water Peter uses to make the ice cubes.

He uses 4 ounces per giant cube, and he makes 3 of them. So, 3 times 4 ounces equals 12 ounces.

Next, he uses 2 ounces per medium cube, and he makes 7 of them. So, 7 times 2 ounces equals 14 ounces.

Then, he uses 0.5 ounces per small cube, and he makes 8 of them. So, 8 times 0.5 ounces equals 4 ounces.

Now, I'll add up all the water used: 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces equals 28 ounces.

Finally, I'll subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces to find out how much water is left. 32 ounces minus 28 ounces equals 4 ounces.

**Solution:**

Let's determine how many ounces of water Peter uses to make the ice cubes and then find out how much water he has left.

1. **Calculate the water used for each type of cube:**
   
   - **Giant Cubes:**  
     Each giant cube uses **4 ounces** of water.  
     Number of giant cubes made: **3**  
     Total water used for giant cubes:  
     \[
     3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces/cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
     \]

   - **Medium Cubes:**  
     Each medium cube uses **2 ounces** of water.  
     Number of medium cubes made: **7**  
     Total water used for medium cubes:  
     \[
     7 \text{ cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces/cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
     \]

   - **Small Cubes:**  
     Each small cube uses **0.5 ounces** of water.  
     Number of small cubes made: **8**  
     Total water used for small cubes:  
     \[
     8 \text{ cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces/cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total water used:**
   
   \[
   12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 28 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining water:**
   
   Peter started with **32 ounces** of water.  
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} - 28 \text{ ounces} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
