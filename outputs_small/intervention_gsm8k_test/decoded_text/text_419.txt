Q: Stanley was standing on the side of the mountain, at an elevation of 10,000 feet, when a gust air blew the comb out of his pocket, causing the comb to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below.  Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Stanley and his comb. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Stanley is standing on the side of a mountain, and his elevation is 10,000 feet. Wait, that seems right. Then, a gust of wind blows the comb out of his pocket, causing it to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below. So, the comb falls 4,000 feet from Stanley's position. 

Now, Stanley calls his brother, Oliver, who is also on the mountain but, that seems right. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. So, Oliver is lower than Stanley. The question is, how many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb? 

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his position. So, the comb is now at 10,000 feet minus 4,000 feet. Let me calculate that. 

10,000 minus 4,000. Let me write that out:

10,000  
-4,000  
= ?

Starting from the right, 0 minus 0 is 0. Then, 0 minus 0 is 0. Then, 0 minus 4. Hmm, can't do that, so I need to borrow. So, the thousands place: 0 becomes 10, and the hundreds place becomes 9. Then, 10 minus 4 is 8. Then, the tens place: 9 minus 0 is 9. The hundreds place: 9 minus 0 is 9. The thousands place: 0 minus 4. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the ten-thousands place. The ten-thousands place is 1, so it becomes 0, and the thousands place becomes 10. Then, 10 minus 4 is 6. So, putting it all together, 10,000 minus 4,000 is 6,000. Wait, that seems right. So, the comb is now at 6,000 feet.

Wait, that seems right. So, Stanley's comb is at 6,000 feet. Now, Oliver is at 3,000 feet. So, how many feet does Oliver need to climb to reach 6,000 feet? 

So, the difference between 6,000 and 3,000 is 3,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. Stanley was at 10,000, fell 4,000, so 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000. Oliver is at 3,000. So, 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000. So, yes, 3,000 feet. 

Is there any chance I made a mistake in the initial subtraction? Let me verify 10,000 minus 4,000. 10,000 minus 4,000 is indeed 6,000. Because 10,000 minus 4,000 is 6,000. Yeah, that's correct. 

And then, 6,000 minus 3,000 is 3,000. So, that seems correct. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 3,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb. 

Is there any other way to think about this? Maybe in terms of elevation. Stanley's comb is at 6,000, and Oliver is at 3,000. So, the difference is 3,000. Yeah, that's consistent. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward. So, I think the answer is 3,000 feet. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3000}
</think>

Stanley was standing at an elevation of 10,000 feet. A gust of wind caused his comb to fall 4,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of Stanley's comb is calculated as follows:

\[
10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000
\]

Stanley's brother, Oliver, was at an elevation of 3,0
