Q: Brian's basement was damp and musty, so he bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture out of the air.  The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high.   Brian tested the device's efficiency and he found that the low setting removes 1 liter of water out of the air per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.  If Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting, what is the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement, in liters?

Okay, so I have this problem about Brian and his dehumidifier. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Brian bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture. The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high. He tested it and found out how much water each setting removes per day. 

It says that the low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Then, the medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting. Hmm, so if the low is 1 liter, medium must be 2 liters per day. Then, the high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting. So, if medium is 2 liters, high must be 4 liters per day. Let me write that down:

- Low: 1 liter/day
- Medium: 2 liters/day
- High: 4 liters/day

Okay, that makes sense. So each higher setting removes twice the water of the previous one.

Now, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting. I need to find the total amount of water removed over all these days.

Let me break it down day by day.

First, 3 days on low setting. Each day, it removes 1 liter. So, for 3 days, that's 3 * 1 = 3 liters.

Then, he ran it for 3 more days on the medium setting. Each day, medium removes 2 liters. So, 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters.

Then, he ran it for 5 days on the high setting. Each day, high removes 4 liters. So, 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters.

Now, to find the total water removed, I need to add up all these amounts.

So, 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 3 + 6 + 20.

Let me compute that: 3 + 6 is 9, and 9 + 20 is 29.

Wait, that seems right. So, 29 liters in total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Low: 3 days *1 liter/day = 3 liters. Correct.

Medium: 3 days *2 liters/day = 6 liters. Correct.

High: 5 days *4 liters/day = 20 liters. Correct.

Total: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters. Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total water removed is 29 liters.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 days low, 3 days medium, 5 days high. Each day's water is 1, 2, 4 liters respectively. So, 3*1=3, 3*2=6, 5*4=20. 3+6=9, 9+20=29. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the answer should be 29 liters? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
