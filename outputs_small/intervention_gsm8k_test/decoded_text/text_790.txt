Q: At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a trip to a county-level scavenger hunt competition. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, it says that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. So, initially, they had 90 people, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 90 people, so 90 people in total. Then, it mentions that 9-person groups were formed. So, each group has 9 people. 

Now, the next part says: "If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?" Hmm, okay. So, each group has 9 people, and each person brings back 2 seashells. But, that seems right. So, each group would bring back 9 times 2 seashells, which is 18 seashells per group. 

But, that seems right. So, if each group brings back 18 seashells, and then 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. Wait, that seems right. So, 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, first, we need to figure out how many groups there are in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 people were split into groups of 9. So, the number of groups is 90 divided by 9. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 9 is 10. So, 10 groups in total. So, 10 groups, each with 9 people.

Now, each group has 9 people, and each person brings back 2 seashells. So, each group brings back 9 times 2, which is 18 seashells. So, each group brings back 18 seashells. So, 10 groups, each bringing back 18 seashells, so total seashells would be 10 times 18, which is 160. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 10 groups, each with 9 people, each person brings back 2 seashells, so 10 times 9 is 90 people, each bringing back 2, so 90 times 2 is 180 seashells. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
