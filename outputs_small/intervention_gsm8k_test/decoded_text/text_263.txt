Q: There are 6 trees in Chris's yard.  Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.  How many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Chris, Ferdinand, and Harry's yards with trees. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 6 trees in Chris's yard. That seems straightforward. So Chris has 6 trees. 

Next, it mentions that Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Hmm, okay. So if Chris has 6, half of that would be... let me calculate that. Half of 6 is 3. So Ferdinand has 3 trees. That part is easy.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out how many trees Harry has. It says Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Alright, let's break that down. First, twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3, twice that would be 3 times 2, which is 6. Then, Harry has 5 more than that. So 6 plus 5 is 11. So Harry has 11 trees. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. Twice Ferdinand's trees: 2*3=6. Then, 5 more than that: 6+5=11. Yeah, that's correct. So Harry has 11 trees.

Now, the question is asking how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard. So we need to find the difference between the number of trees Harry has and the number of trees Ferdinand has. 

Ferdinand has 3 trees, and Harry has 11 trees. So the difference is 11 minus 3. Let me do that subtraction: 11 - 3 = 8. So Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half of that, which is 3. Harry has twice that number, which is 6, plus 5, which is 11. Then, Harry has 11, Ferdinand has 3. 11 minus 3 is 8. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The problem was pretty straightforward once I broke it down into each person's number of trees. It's just a matter of translating the words into numbers and then performing the arithmetic. 

So, to recap: Chris has 6, Ferdinand has half of that, which is 3, and Harry has twice that plus 5, which is 11. The difference between Harry and Ferdinand is 8. So the answer should be 8.

**Final Answer**
The number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is \boxed{8}.

Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, which is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. This is calculated as:
\[ \text{Harry's trees} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

To find how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is \boxed{8}.
