Q: Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Movie C was 1.25 hours. How many minutes long was Movie A?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about three movies: A, B, and C. The question is asking how long Movie A is in minutes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Hmm, okay, so if I let the length of Movie A be some variable, say A, then Movie B must be four times that. So, A = (1/4) * B. That makes sense.

Next, it mentions that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, if I let the length of Movie C be C, then Movie B is C plus 5 minutes. So, B = C + 5. Got that.

Then, it says Movie C was 1.25 hours. Wait, that seems right. I know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours would be 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes to make it easier. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1.25 hours is 60 + 15 = 70 minutes? Wait, that seems right. 1.25 * 60 is 76.5 minutes? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me calculate that again. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 00 minutes is 1.25 hours. So, 1.25 * 60 = 76.5 minutes. So, Movie C is 76.5 minutes long.

So, now I can plug that into the equation for B. Since B = C + 5, and C is 76.5, then B = 76.5 + 5 = 81.5 minutes. Wait, that seems right. 76.5 plus 5 is 81.5 minutes. So, Movie B is 81.5 minutes long.

Now, since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, I can find A by taking 81.5 divided by 4. Let me do that. 81.5 divided by 4. Hmm, 8 divided by 4 is 2, and 1.5 divided by 4 is 0.375. So, adding those together, 2 + 0.375 is 2.375 minutes. So, Movie A is 2.375 minutes long.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. First, Movie C is 1.25 hours, which is 76.5 minutes. Then, Movie B is 5 minutes longer, so 76.5 + 5 = 81.5 minutes. Then, Movie A is one-fourth of that, so 81.5 / 4. Let me compute that again. 81 divided by 4 is 20.25, and 0.5 divided by 4 is 0.125. So, 20.25 + 0.125 is 20.375 minutes. Wait, that seems right.
