Q: When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?

Okay, so Marcus wakes up to his house being 40 degrees. Hmm, wait, that seems right. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on, the temperature goes up by 5 degrees. Then he opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 100 minutes the window is open. I need to find the final temperature.

Let me break this down step by step. First, the initial temperature is 40 degrees. Then, he bakes for 3 hours. Each hour, the oven is on, so that's 3 hours. Each hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees. So, how much does it increase over 3 hours?

Well, 3 hours times 5 degrees per hour is 15 degrees. So, the temperature after baking would be 40 + 15. Let me calculate that: 40 + 15 is 59 degrees. So, after baking, the house is 59 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 100 minutes the window is open. Wait, that seems right. So, the cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes. So, how much does it cool down in 30 minutes?

First, let me figure out how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes. So, 30 divided by 10 is 3. So, 3 intervals. Each interval, the temperature drops by 2 degrees. So, 3 times 2 is 6 degrees. So, the temperature after cooling would be 59 - 6. Let me compute that: 59 - 6 is 53 degrees.

Wait, that seems right. So, the final temperature is 53 degrees. Let me just double-check my calculations.

Starting at 40 degrees. Baking for 3 hours, each hour 5 degrees, so 3*5=15. 40+15=59. Wait, that seems right. Then, cooling for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. The cooling rate is 2 degrees per 10 minutes, which is 2/10=0.2 degrees per minute. So, 0.2 degrees per minute times 30 minutes is 6 degrees. So, 59-6=53. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the final temperature is 53 degrees. So, the answer is 53 degrees.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Starting at 40, baking for 3 hours, each hour 5, so 15, so 55. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
