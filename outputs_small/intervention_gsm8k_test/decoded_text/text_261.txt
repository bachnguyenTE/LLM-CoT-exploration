Okay, so I have this problem here: There are 9,300 pennies in a cup. What is the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that each penny is worth $0.01, which is 10 cents. So, if I have a certain number of pennies, the total dollar amount would be the number of pennies multiplied by $0.01. That makes sense because each penny is a fraction of a dollar.

The problem says there are 9,300 pennies in the cup. I need to find out how much two-thirds of that number is in dollars. So, I think the first step is to calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies. Let me write that down.

So, two-thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300. Hmm, let me compute that. I can do this by dividing 9,300 by 3 first and then multiplying by 2. Let me see, 9,300 divided by 3. Let me do the division.

9,300 divided by 3. Well, 3 goes into 9 three times, so that's 3. Then, 3 goes into 3 once, so that's another 1. Then, 3 goes into 0 zero times, so that's 0. Wait, that seems right. So, 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100. Because 3 times 3,100 is 9,300. Let me check: 3,100 times 3 is 9,300. Yes, that's correct.

So, two-thirds of 9,300 is 2 times 3,100, which is 6,200. pennies. So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack. Now, I need to convert that number into dollars. Since each penny is $0.01, I can multiply 6,200 by 0.01.

Let me compute that. 6,200 times 0.01 is the same as moving the decimal point one place to the left, which gives me 620. So, 6,200 pennies equal $620.00. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 6,200 pennies times $0.01 per penny is indeed $62.00. Wait, that seems right. 6,200 pennies is 620 dimes, and each dime is $0.10, so 620 times $0.10 is $62.00. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, putting it all together: 9,300 pennies in the cup, two-thirds of that is 6,200 pennies, which is $62.00. So, the total dollar amount in the stack is $62.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, two-thirds of 9,300. 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100, times 2 is 6,200. Then, 6,200 pennies times $0.01 is $62.00. Yeah, that all adds up. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 9,300 divided by 3 is 3,100, so two-thirds is 6,200. Then, 6,200 pennies is 6,200 times $0.01, which is $62.00. Yeah, that's consistent.

I guess another way to think about it is, if each penny is $0.01, then 10 pennies make a dime, which is $0.10. So, 10 pennies is $0.10, so 100 pennies is $1.00, and 1,000 pennies is $10.0. So, 6,200 pennies would be 6,200 divided by 10 is 620 dimes, which is 620 times $0.10, which is $62.00. Yeah, that also works.

So, I think I'm confident that the total dollar
