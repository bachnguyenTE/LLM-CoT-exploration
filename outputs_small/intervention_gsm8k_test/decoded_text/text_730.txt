Q: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.  How many packs of gum will he need to last him 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Each pack has 15 pieces. He wants to know how many packs he'll need to last him 30 days. Wait, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many pieces of gum Parker will consume in total over 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces each day, I can multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days. So, 4 pieces/day multiplied by 30 days. Let me write that down:

Total gum consumed = 4 pieces/day * 30 days

Hmm, 4 times 30. Let me calculate that. 4 times 30 is... 4*30 is 120. So, he'll consume 120 pieces of gum in total over 30 days.

Now, each pack has 15 pieces. So, to find out how many packs he needs, I should divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack. That would be:

Number of packs = Total gum consumed / Pieces per pack

Plugging in the numbers:

Number of packs = 120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack

Let me do that division. 120 divided by 15. Hmm, 15 goes into 120 how many times? Well, 15 times 8 is 120 because 15*8 is 120. So, 120 divided by 15 is 8. So, he needs 8 packs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 4 pieces a day times 30 days is indeed 120. 120 divided by 15 is 8. So, yeah, 8 packs. That makes sense.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by calculating how many days one pack will last him. If each pack has 15 pieces and he chews 4 a day, then 15 divided by 4 is 3.75 days. So, each pack lasts about 3 and three-quarters days. So, over 30 days, how many packs would that be?

Number of packs = Total days / Days per pack

Which is 30 divided by 3.75. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 3.75. Hmm, 3.75 goes into 30 how many times? 3.75 times 8 is 30 because 3.75*8 is 30. So, that also gives 8 packs. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

So, both methods give me 8 packs. That seems solid.

Wait, that seems right. So, 8 packs is the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:

- Parker chews 4 pieces a day.
- 30 days total.
- Total gum needed: 4*30=120? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
