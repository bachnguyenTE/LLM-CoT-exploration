Q: On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Peter's exercise routine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that on Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he did 16 minutes. The question is asking how many minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal. 

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to find out how much time Peter has already spent exercising on Sunday and Monday. Then, I can figure out what twice that combined time is, and subtract that from the total he wants to exercise on Tuesday. Wait, that seems right. Let me write this out.

So, on Sunday, he did 23 minutes. On Monday, he did 16 minutes. So, combined, that's 23 plus 16. Let me add those together. 23 plus 16 is 29 minutes. So, combined, he exercised for 29 minutes on Sunday and Monday.

Now, Peter wants to exercise twice that amount on Tuesday. So, twice 29 minutes. Hmm, 29 times 2. Let me calculate that. 20 times 29 is 58, right? Because 20 times 29 is 580, and 9 times 29 is 261, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 29 times 2 is 58. So, Peter wants to exercise 58 minutes on Tuesday.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if he wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined, which is 29 minutes, then twice that is 58 minutes. So, he needs to exercise 58 minutes on Tuesday.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, Sunday: 23, Monday:16, total:29. Twice that is 58. Yeah, that seems correct. So, Peter needs to exercise 58 minutes on Tuesday.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 58 minutes. So, he needs to exercise 58 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. So, he wants to exercise twice the amount he did on Sunday and Monday combined. So, first, add Sunday and Monday: 23 +16=39. Wait, that seems right. 23 plus 16 is 39. Then, twice that is 78. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
