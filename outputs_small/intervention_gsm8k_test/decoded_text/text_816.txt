Q: John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each.  How much money did he spend?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the goats. John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so I'll multiply 3 by 550 to find the total cost for the goats.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the cows. John buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so I'll multiply 2 by 1510 to find the total cost for the cows.

Finally, I'll add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount John spent at the market.

**Solution:**

John buys:
- **3 goats** at \$550 each.
- **2 cows** at \$1510 each.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the goats.**

\[
3 \text{ goats} \times \$550 \text{ per goat} = 3 \times 550 = 1650 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cows.**

\[
2 \text{ cows} \times \$1510 \text{ per cow} = 2 \times 1510 = 1020 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Add the total costs of goats and cows to find the total amount spent.**

\[
1650 \text{ dollars} + 1020 \text{ dollars} = 2672 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2672}
\]
