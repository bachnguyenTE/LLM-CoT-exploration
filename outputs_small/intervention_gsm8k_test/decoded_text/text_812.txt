Q: Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Okay, so Rose is picking flowers for a vase, and I need to figure out how many petals are on the flowers after she drops one of each type. Let me break this down step by step.

First, Rose starts by picking flowers. The first part says she picks 3 flowers, each with 5 petals. So, I can calculate the total petals for these. That would be 3 flowers multiplied by 5 petals each. Let me write that down: 3 * 5 = 15 petals. So, she has 15 petals from the first set.

Next, she picks 4 flowers, each with 6 petals. Hmm, okay, so that's 4 flowers * 6 petals each. Let me calculate that: 4 * 6 = 24 petals. So, adding that to the previous total, we have 15 petals so far (15 = 15 + 24). Wait, that seems right. 15 from the first set and 24 from the second set.

Then, she adds another 5 flowers, each with 4 petals. So, 5 flowers * 4 petals each. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 petals. Adding that to the previous total: 15 + 24 = 39, then 39 + 20 = 59 petals. Wait, that seems right. 59 petals in total after the third set.

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers, each with 7 petals. So, 6 flowers * 7 petals each. Let me compute that: 6 * 7 = 42 petals. Adding that to the previous total: 59 + 42 = 101 petals. So, after all her picking, she has 101 petals in total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First set: 3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals. That's correct.

Second set: 4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals. Adding to 15 gives 39. Wait, that seems right. 15 + 24 is 39.

Third set: 5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals. Adding to 39 gives 59. That's correct.

Fourth set: 6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals. Adding to 59 gives 101 petals. That seems correct.

So, she has 101 petals in total before she drops any. Now, she drops 1 of each flower. So, how many flowers does she drop? She drops 1 of each type she picked. Let me see how many types she picked.

She picked four different types: 3 flowers, 4 flowers, 5 flowers, and 6 flowers. So, that's four types. Therefore, she drops 1 of each type, meaning she drops 4 flowers in total.

Each of these four types she drops one flower. So, she loses 1 petal from each of these four types. So, she loses 4 petals in total.

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase after dropping is 101 - 4 = 97 petals.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify again.

Total petals before dropping: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101.

She drops 1 of each type, so 4 petals lost. 101 - 4 = 97.

So, the total number of petals in the vase is 97.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, that seems right. She starts with 3, 4, 5, 6 flowers, each with different petals. She drops one of each, so 4 flowers in total, each losing 1 petal. So, 4 petals lost. So, 101 -4=97.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 97 petals.

**Final Answer**
The total number of petals in the vase is \boxed{97}.

Rose starts by picking flowers and calculating the total number of petals for each type:

1. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together, the total number of petals
