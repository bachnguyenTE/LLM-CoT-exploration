Q: Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate the total cost of the apples by multiplying the number of apples by the price per apple: 3 apples × $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, calculate the total cost of the oranges by multiplying the number of oranges by the price per orange: 5 oranges × $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, calculate the total cost of the peaches by multiplying the number of peaches by the price per peach: 6 peaches × $0.75 = $4.50.

Add up the total costs of apples, oranges, and peaches to find the overall total cost: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave to find the change she received: $20.0 - $13.00 = $7.00.

**Solution:**

Verna bought three apples, five oranges, and six peaches. To find out how much change she received, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of each fruit:**
   - **Apples:** 
     \[
     3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50/\text{apple} = \$4.50
     \]
   - **Oranges:**
     \[
     5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80/\text{orange} = \$4.00
     \]
   - **Peaches:**
     \[
     6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75/\text{peach} = \$4.50
     \]

2. **Add up the total costs:**
   \[
   \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave:**
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$7.00}
\]
