Q: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to translate the words into mathematical equations. Let me assign variables to their current ages. Let's say B represents Brooke's current age. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, that means Seth's current age is 2 times B, so I can write that as S = 2B.

Now, the problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, both Seth and Brooke will be 2 years older. That means in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2, and Brooke's age will be B + 2. The sum of these two ages is 28. So, I can write that as (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

1. S = 2B
2. (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now, I can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for B. Since S is 2B, I can replace S in the second equation with 2B.

So, substituting S with 2B in the second equation:

(2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Now, let me simplify this equation. Combine like terms:

2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28

So, 2B + B is 3B, and 2 + 2 is 4. So, the equation becomes:

3B + 4 = 28

Now, I need to solve for B. Let me subtract 4 from both sides:

3B = 28 - 4
3B = 24

Then, divide both sides by 3:

B = 24 / 3
B = 8

So, Broke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Broke, his age is 2 times 8, which is 16.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Broke is 8, then Seth is 16. In 2 years, Broke will be 10 and Seth will be 18. The sum of their ages in 2 years is 10 + 18 = 18. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 10 + 18 is 28? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
