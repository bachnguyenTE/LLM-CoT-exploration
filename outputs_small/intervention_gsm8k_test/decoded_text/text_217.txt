Q: There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses in the vase. How many flowers are there in the vase in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I identify the number of roses in the vase, which is 4.

Next, I determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, I add 7 to the number of roses: 4 + 7 = 11.

Finally, I calculate the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Roses:**
   - There are **4 roses** in the vase.

2. **Number of Dahlias:**
   - It's given that there are **7 more dahlias** than roses.
   - So, the number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
   - Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = **11**

3. **Total Number of Flowers:**
   - Total flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
   - Total flowers = 4 + 11 = **15**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{15}
