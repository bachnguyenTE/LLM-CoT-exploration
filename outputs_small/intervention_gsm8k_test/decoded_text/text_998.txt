Q: Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dylan and his wedding reception. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that there were 100 guests at the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, I need to find out how many cookies there were in total at the reception. Hmm, that sounds like multiplication. If each guest has 15 cookies, then 100 guests would have 100 multiplied by 15. Let me write that down:

Total cookies = Number of guests × Cookies per guest
Total cookies = 100 × 15

Hmm, 100 times 15. Let me calculate that. 100 times 10 is 1100, and 1100 times 5 is... wait, that seems right. 100 × 5 is 550? Wait, that seems right. 100 × 5 is 550. So, there were 550 cookies in total at the reception.

Now, the next part says the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you. So, half of 550 cookies. Let me write that down:

Cookies given to church = Total cookies / 2
Cookies given to church = 550 / 2

Calculating that, 550 divided by 2 is 275. So, the church received 275 cookies.

Now, each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. So, we need to find out how many people were there. That means we need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got. Let me write that:

Number of people = Cookies given to church / Cookies per person
Number of people = 275 / 15

Hmm, let me do that division. 275 divided by 15. Let me see, 15 times 18 is 270, right? Because 15 × 10 is 150, and 15 ×8 is 120, so 150 + 120 is 270. So, 15 ×18 is 270. Then, 275 minus 270 is 5. So, 275 divided by 15 is 18 with a remainder of 5. So, that would be 18 and 5/15, which simplifies to 18 and 1/3. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right.
