Q: Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for a batch of suckers and 70 ounces for a batch of fudge. The question is asking how much sugar he needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out how much sugar is required for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch is 30 ounces, I can multiply 30 by 8. Let me write that down: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces. So, that's the sugar needed for the suckers part.

Next, I need to calculate the sugar required for 1 batch of fudge. The problem says he needs 70 ounces for one batch, so that's straightforward. 70 ounces is the amount for 1 batch. So, no multiplication needed here, just 70 ounces.

Now, to find the total sugar needed, I should add the two amounts together. That would be 240 ounces (for the suckers) plus 70 ounces (for the fudge). Let me add those: 240 + 70. Hmm, 240 plus 70 is 310. So, the total sugar needed is 310 ounces.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 30 times 8 is indeed 240 because 30*8 is 240. And 70 is just 70. Adding them together, 240 + 70 is 310, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 240 + 70 is 310? Wait, that seems right. 240 + 70 is 310? Wait, that seems right. 240 + 70 is 310? Wait, that seems right. 240 + 70 is 310?
