Q: There are 700 bees in a hive. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about bees in a hive. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says there are 700 bees in total. It also mentions the relationships between the different types of bees: worker bees, baby bees, and queens. Specifically, it says there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. I need to find out how many worker bees there are.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I should probably assign variables to each type of bee to make it easier to work with. Let me think... If I let the number of queens be a variable, say Q, then maybe I can express the number of baby bees and worker bees in terms of Q. That seems like a good approach.

So, let's say the number of queens is Q. Then, the problem says there are twice as many baby bees as queens. So, the number of baby bees would be 2 times Q, right? So, baby bees = 2Q.

Similarly, it says there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if the number of baby bees is 2Q, then the number of worker bees would be twice that, which is 2*(2Q) = 4Q. So, worker bees = 4Q.

Now, the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. So, that would be Q (queens) + 2Q (baby bees) + 4Q (worker bees) = total bees.

Let me write that out: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.

Wait, that seems right. So, adding those up, Q + 2Q is 3Q, and 3Q + 4Q is 7Q. So, 7Q = 700.

Wait, that seems right. So, 7Q = 700. So, to find Q, I can divide both sides by 7. So, Q = 700 / 7.

Let me calculate that. 700 divided by 7 is 100. So, Q = 100. So, there are 100 queens in the hive.

Now, since the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens, that would be 2*100 = 200 baby bees.

And the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so that's 2*200 = 400 worker bees.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 100 queens, 200 baby bees, 400 worker bees. Adding them up: 100 + 200 is 300, plus 400 is 700. That matches the total number of bees given in the problem. So, that seems correct.

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Let Q = number of queens.
2. Number of baby bees = 2Q.
3. Number of worker bees = 2*(number of baby bees) = 2*(2Q) = 4Q.
4. Total bees = Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q.
5. 7Q = 700.
6. Q = 700 /7 = 100.
7. Baby bees = 2*100 = 200.
8. Worker bees = 2*200 = 400.
9. Check: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Correct.

So, yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It all adds up correctly, and the relationships are maintained as per the problem statement.

I guess another way to think about it is to use ratios. The problem says worker bees are twice as many as baby bees, and baby bees are twice as many as queens. So, the ratio of worker to baby to queen is 4:2:1. Because if queens are 1, then baby bees are 2, and worker bees are 4. So, the ratio is 4:2:1.

So, the total parts in the ratio are 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 parts. And the total number of bees is 700. So, each part is 700 /7 = 100. Therefore, the number of worker bees is 4 parts, which is 4*100 = 400. That's another way to get the same answer, which reinforces that
