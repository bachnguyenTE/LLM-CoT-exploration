Q: Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%.  The third year it depreciated 20%.  How much is the boat worth after the three years?

Okay, so Gary bought a boat for $9,000. Hmm, and it depreciates over three years. Let me see. First year it depreciates 30%, second year another 30%, and third year 20%. I need to figure out how much the boat is worth after those three years. 

Alright, so depreciation means the value decreases each year. So, each year, the boat loses a certain percentage of its value. I think I need to calculate the value after each year step by step. Let me break it down.

First, the initial value is $9,000. That's straightforward. Now, the first year it depreciates 30%. So, I need to find 30% of $9,000 and subtract that from the original price to get the value after the first year.

Let me calculate 30% of 9000. To find a percentage, I can multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by the original amount. So, 30% is 0.30 in decimal. So, 0.30 * 9000. Let me compute that.

0.30 * 9000. Hmm, 0.3 * 9000 is 2700, right? Because 0.3 is 30%, so 30% of 9000 is 2700. So, the first year depreciation is $2700. Therefore, the value after the first year is 9000 - 2700.

Let me subtract that: 9000 - 2700. 9000 minus 2000 is 7000, and then minus another 700 is 7000. So, after the first year, the boat is worth $7000.

Okay, moving on to the second year. It depreciates another 30%. So, now I need to find 30% of $7000 and subtract that from $7000.

Again, 30% is 0.30 in decimal. So, 0.30 * 7000. Let me compute that. 0.3 * 7000 is 2100. So, the depreciation is $2100. Therefore, the value after the second year is 7000 - 2100.

Subtracting that: 7000 - 2000 is 5000, and then minus another 100 is 4900. So, after the second year, the boat is worth $4900.

Now, onto the third year. It depreciates 20%. So, I need to find 20% of $4900 and subtract that from $4900.

20% is 0.20 in decimal. So, 0.20 * 4900. Let me calculate that. 0.2 * 4900 is 980. So, the depreciation is $980. Therefore, the value after the third year is 4900 - 980.

Subtracting that: 4900 - 900 is 4000, and then minus another 80 is 3920. So, after the third year, the boat is worth $3920.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First year: 30% of 9000 is 2700, so 9000 - 2700 is 6300? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
