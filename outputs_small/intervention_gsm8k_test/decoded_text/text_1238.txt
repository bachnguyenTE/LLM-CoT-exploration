Q: Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese.  How much money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, Bud makes it once a week. That means he does this 52 times a year, right? So, I should calculate his weekly expenses and then multiply by 52 to get the annual total.

Let me list out the costs he has each week. He buys pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese. 

1. **Pasta:** The pasta costs $1.00 a box. So, each week, he spends $1.00 on pasta.

2. **Cheddar Cheese:** He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week. That's straightforward.

3. **Gruyere Cheese:** The problem says he spends twice the amount he spends on cheddar cheese. Cheddar is $3.00, so twice that would be 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Got it.

So, adding up his weekly expenses: pasta ($1.00) + cheddar ($3.00) + gruyere ($6.00). Let me add those up.

First, pasta and cheddar: $1.00 + $3.00 = $4.00. Then, add the gruyere: $4.00 + $6.00 = $10.00. Wait, that seems right. So, he spends $10.00 each week.

Now, to find out how much he spends in a year, I need to multiply his weekly expense by 52 weeks. So, $10.00 * 52.

Let me compute that. 10 * 52 is 520. So, $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Pasta: $1.00 per week. Cheddar: $3.00. Gruyere: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. Total per week: 1 + 3 +6 = 10. So, $10.00 per week. 10 * 52 = 520. Yeah, that seems correct.

Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me think again. If he spends $10 a week, over 52 weeks, that's 52 weeks * 10 = 520. So, $520.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer should be $520.00.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem says he makes it once a week, spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and twice that amount on gruyere. So, that's 1 + 3 + 6 = 10. So, 10 per week, 52 weeks, 520. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. So, I think the answer is $520.00.

**Final Answer**
Bud spends \boxed{520} dollars on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week. To determine how much he spends in one year, we first calculate his weekly expenses.

1. **Pasta:** $1.00 per week.
2. **Cheddar Cheese:** $3.00 per week.
3. **Gruyere Cheese:** Twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars per week.

Adding up his weekly expenses:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar Cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere Cheese: $6.00

Total weekly expense: \(1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00\) dollars.

To find the annual expense, we multiply the weekly expense by 52 weeks:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Thus, Bud spends \boxed{520} dollars on making macaroni and cheese in one year.
