Q: At the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.  The teacher agreed.  Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes. If she can sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each, how much money can Kate make?

Okay, so Kate has this problem where she wants to make crayon muffins. Let me try to figure out how much money she can make. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. So, I need to find out how many small pieces of crayons she has in total. If each box has 64 crayons, and there are 3 boxes, then the total number of crayons is 3 multiplied by 64. Let me write that down:

Total crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons.

Wait, that seems right. 64 times 3 is 192. So, Kate has 192 small pieces of crayons.

Now, she wants to make muffins by melting 8 small pieces together in a muffin tin. So, each muffin requires 8 pieces. I need to figure out how many muffins she can make with all 192 pieces.

To find out the number of muffins, I can divide the total number of crayons by the number needed per muffin. So, that would be:

Number of muffins = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin = 192 / 8.

Let me calculate that. 192 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 goes into 19 two times (since 8*2=16), subtract 16 from 19, you get 3. Bring down the 2, making it 32. 8 goes into 32 four times. So, 24. So, 192 divided by 8 is 24. So, she can make 24 muffins.

Wait, that seems right. 8 times 24 is 192. Yep, that checks out.

Now, each muffin she sells for $1.50. So, to find out how much money she can make, I need to multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin.

So, total money = Number of muffins * Price per muffin = 24 * $1.50.

Let me compute that. 24 times 1.50. Hmm, 24 times 1 is 24, and 24 times 0.50 is 12. So, 24 + 12 is 36. So, 24 * 1.50 is $36.

Wait, that seems right. 24 times 1.50 is 36. So, Kate can make $36 from selling the muffins.

But, that seems right. Let me just double-check my steps.

1. Total crayons: 3 boxes * 64 = 192. Correct.
2. Number of muffins: 192 / 8 = 24. Correct.
3. Total money: 24 * 1.50 = 36. Correct.

So, all the steps add up. So, I think the answer is $36.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{36}
</think>

Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. To find the total number of crayons, we calculate:

\[
3 \times 64 = 192
\]

Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons. To find the number of muffins, we divide the total number of crayons by the number needed per muffin:

\[
192 \div 8 = 24
\]

Kate can sell each muffin for $1.50. To find the total money she can make, we multiply the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[
24 \times 1.50 = 36
\]

Thus, the total money Kate can make is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]
