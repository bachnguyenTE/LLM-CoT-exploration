Q: Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, every month she collects one shell. By her 10th birthday, how many shells will Martha have collected?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine how many years have passed from when Martha turned 5 to when she turned 10.

Next, calculate the total number of months between these two ages by multiplying the number of years by 12.

Finally, multiply the total number of months by the number of shells Martha collects each month to find the total number of shells collected by her 10th birthday.
</think>

**Solution:**

Martha collects **1 shell** every month starting from when she turned **5 years old**.

1. **Calculate the number of years between when she turned 5 and 10:**
   
   \[
   10 - 5 = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Convert years to months:**
   
   \[
   5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of shells collected:**
   
   \[
   60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
