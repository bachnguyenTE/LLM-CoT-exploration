Q: Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rosie and her running. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says: Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour. How many miles can she run in 7 hours? Hmm, okay. So, she has two different speeds for different periods of time, and we need to find the total distance she can run in 7 hours.

Let me break it down. She runs at 10 mph for the first 3 hours. Then, after that, she slows down to 5 mph. But, that seems right. So, she runs for 3 hours at 10 mph, and then the remaining time at 5 mph. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time after the first 3 hours would be 7 minus 3, which is 4 hours. So, she runs 10 mph for 3 hours and 5 mph for 4 hours. 

Now, to find the total distance, I need to calculate the distance she covers in each part and then add them together. Distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, right? So, for the first part, distance equals 10 mph times 3 hours. Let me write that down: 10 * 3. That should be 30 miles. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Then, for the second part, she runs at 5 mph for 4 hours. So, distance is 5 * 4. Let me calculate that: 5 * 4 is 20 miles. Wait, that seems right. So, 20 miles.

Now, to find the total distance, I need to add both distances together. So, 30 miles plus 20 miles. That should be 50 miles. Hmm, so total distance is 50 miles. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 10 mph for 3 hours is 30 miles. 5 mph for 4 hours is 20 miles. 30 plus 20 is 50 miles. Yeah, that seems correct. 

But, that seems right. Let me think again. She runs for 3 hours at 10 mph, so 10*3=30. Then, she runs for 4 hours at 5 mph, so 5*4=20. 30+20=50. Yeah, that's correct. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 50 miles. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using equations or something.

Let me denote the time she runs at 10 mph as t1 and the time she runs at 5 mph as t2. We know that t1 + t2 = 7 hours. And we know her speed for each part. So, the distance she runs at 10 mph is 10*t1, and the distance she runs at 5 mph is 5*t2. So, total distance D = 10*t1 + 5*t2.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, we have two variables, t1 and t2, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, we have t1 + t2 =7, and D=10*t1 +5*t2. But, that seems right. So, we can solve for t1 and t2.

But, that seems right. So, if we have t1 + t2 =7, and D=10*t1 +5*t2. But, that seems right. So, we can express t2 as 7 - t1, and substitute into the distance equation.

So, D=10*t1 +5*(7 - t1). Let's compute that: 10*t1 +35 -5*t1. So, that's (10t1 -5t1) +35. So, 5t1 +35. So, D=5t1 +35.

But, that seems right. So, D is a function of t1. But, that seems right. So, if we can find t1, we can find D. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, we need another equation or a way to find t1.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, perhaps, we can think about the problem differently. Maybe, is there a way to find t1 and t2 without knowing the total time? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, perhaps, we can think about the total distance.

Wait,
