Q: In a school activity, fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed to form?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: there are fifty-four students, and they need to be separated into six groups of equal size. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me read it again.

"In a school activity, fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed to form?"

Hmm, okay, so first, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 54 students, and they need to be divided into six groups, each of equal size. But, that seems right. So, if there are six groups, each group would have 54 divided by 6, which is 9 students per group. So, each group has nine students.

But, that seems right. So, 54 divided by 6 is 9. So, each group is 9 students. So, that's the first part.

Now, the activity requires 12 groups. So, how many more groups are needed? So, they already have six groups, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
