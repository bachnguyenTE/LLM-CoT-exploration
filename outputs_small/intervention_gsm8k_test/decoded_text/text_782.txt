Q: Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. How many times do they ride their bikes a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Chase and Rider riding their bikes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says they ride their bikes three times a day for five days. Then, on the other two days, they ride twice the number of times they do on usual days. I need to find out how many times they ride their bikes in a week.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, they ride three times a day on five days. That part seems straightforward. Then, on the remaining two days, they ride twice as much as they do on those usual days. So, I need to calculate the total rides for the five days and then add the rides for the two extra days.

Let me write this out. For the five days, they ride three times each day. So, that would be 3 rides/day multiplied by 5 days. Let me calculate that: 3 times 5 is 15. So, they ride 15 times in those five days.

Now, on the other two days, they ride twice as much as usual. Since they usually ride three times a day, twice that would be 3 times 2, which is 6 rides per day on those two days. So, each of those two days, they ride 6 times.

Now, I need to find the total rides for the week. That would be the rides on the five days plus the rides on the two extra days. So, 15 rides from the five days plus 6 rides each day for two days. Let me calculate that: 15 plus (6 times 2). 6 times 2 is 12, so 15 plus 12 is 27.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. Five days at 3 rides each: 5*3=15. Two days at 6 rides each: 2*6=12. 15+12=27. Yeah, that adds up.

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27 times.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. It's 27 rides in a week.

**Final Answer**
The total number of bike rides Chase and Rider do in a week is \boxed{27}.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes three times a day for five days. This gives us:

\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the remaining two days, they ride twice the usual number of times. This gives us:

\[ 2 \times (3 \text{ rides/day}) = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]

For the two extra days, the total rides are:

\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from the five days and the two extra days together:

\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

However, upon reviewing the problem, it seems there was a miscalculation. The correct total should be:

\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.
