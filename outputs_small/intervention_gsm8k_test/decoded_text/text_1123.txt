Q: Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?

Okay, so I have this problem here about the weights of dogs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. The question is asking how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds.

Alright, so let me break this down. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs: one that's one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog, and another that's half the weight of Kory’s dog. So, I need to find the total weight of both of Elijah’s dogs and Kory’s dog combined.

First, let me figure out the weight of the first dog that Elijah has. It says it's one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. So, one-fourth of 60 pounds. Hmm, okay, so I can calculate that by dividing 60 by 4.

Let me write that down: 60 divided by 4. Let me do the division. 4 goes into 6 once, with a remainder of 2. Then bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So, 60 divided by 4 is 15. So, the first dog is 15 pounds.

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the second dog that Elijah has is half the weight of Kory’s dog. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, so half of that would be 30 pounds. So, the second dog is 30 pounds.

Now, I need to find the total weight of both of Elijah’s dogs and Kory’s dog. So, that would be Kory’s dog plus the first dog plus the second dog.

So, let me add them up. Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, the first dog is 15 pounds, and the second dog is 30 pounds. So, 60 plus 15 is 75, and then 75 plus 30 is 105. Wait, that seems right. Let me check my addition again.

60 plus 15 is 75, yes. Then 75 plus 30 is 105. Hmm, 105 pounds? That seems a bit light, but, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the weights.

So, Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. One-fourth of that is 15 pounds, which seems correct because 60 divided by 4 is 15. Half of 60 is 30 pounds, that's also correct. So, adding them up: 60 + 15 + 30. Let me add 60 and 15 first, which is 75, then add 30, which gives 105. So, 105 pounds in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total weight is 105 pounds. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I could think of it as Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. The two of Elijah’s dogs are one-fourth and half of that. So, one-fourth is 15, half is 30. So, 15 + 30 is 45. Then, adding Kory’s dog, 60 + 45 is 105. Yeah, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. The two dogs are 1/4 and 1/2 of Kory’s dog. So, 1/4 + 1/2 is equal to 3/4. So, 3/4 of Kory’s dog is 3/4 of 60. Let me compute that.

3/4 of 60 is (3/4)*60. Let me compute that. 60 divided by 4 is 15, and 15 times 3 is 45. So, 3/4 of 60 is 45. So, the total weight of both of Elijah’s dogs is 45 pounds, and Kory’s dog is 60 pounds. So, 45 + 60 is 105. So, same answer.

So, whether I add them up step by step or add the fractions first, I get the same result. So, 105 pounds is the total weight.

Wait, that seems right. So,
