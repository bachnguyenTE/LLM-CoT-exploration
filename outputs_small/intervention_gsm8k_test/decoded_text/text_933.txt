Q: A charity group decides to do a yard sale.  10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each.  They also have 10 boxes of stuff already.  They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table.  If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, calculate the total number of boxes donated by the charity group. There are 10 people, each donating 5 boxes, so that's 10 multiplied by 5, which equals 50 boxes.

Next, add the 10 boxes that were already already donated. This gives a total of 50 plus 10, which equals 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, divide the total number of boxes by 2 to find out how many tables are needed. So, 60 divided by 2 equals 30 tables.

The charity group already has 15 tables. Subtracting this from the total number of tables needed gives 30 minus 15, which equals 18 new tables.

Therefore, they need 18 new tables.

To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Boxes Donated**

- **Number of people donating:** 10
- **Boxes donated per person:** 5

\[
\text{Total boxes donated} = 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
\]

### **Step 2: Add the Already Donated Boxes**

- **Already donated boxes:** 10

\[
\text{Total boxes} = 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
\]

### **Step 3: Determine the Number of Tables Needed**

- **Boxes per table:** 2

\[
\text{Total tables needed} = \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
\]

### **Step 4: Subtract the Number of Tables Already Available**

- **Tables already owned:** 15

\[
\text{New tables needed} = 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables}
\]

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
