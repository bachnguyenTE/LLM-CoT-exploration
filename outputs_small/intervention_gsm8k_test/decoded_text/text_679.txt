Q: If 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 96 potatoes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many hash browns can be made with 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.

I'll start by finding out how many hash browns one potato can make. I'll divide the total number of hash browns by the number of potatoes: 36 hash browns ÷ 6 potatoes = 6 hash browns per potato.

Next, I'll calculate the total number of hash browns by multiplying the number of hash browns per potato by the total number of potatoes: 6 hash browns per potato × 96 potatoes = 576 hash browns.

Therefore, with 96 potatoes, I can make 576 hash browns.

**Solution:**

We are given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. We need to find out how many hash browns can be made with 96 potatoes.

1. **Determine the number of hash browns per potato:**

   \[
   \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of hash browns with 96 potatoes:**

   \[
   \text{Total hash browns} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \times 96 \text{ potatoes} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{576}
\]
