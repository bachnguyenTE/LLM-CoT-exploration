Q: John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?

Okay, so I have this problem here where John has 3 boxes, each with dimensions 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, and I need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the inner volume of a box would be its volume minus the volume taken up by the walls. Since each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, I need to figure out how much space is left inside after subtracting the walls.

Let me visualize one box. It's a rectangular prism, right? So, the outer dimensions are 5 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the length is 5 inches, width is 6 inches, and height is 4 inches. But, that seems right. So, the walls are 1 inch thick on all sides. So, the inner dimensions would be smaller by 2 inches in each dimension because the walls are on both sides.

Wait, that seems right. If the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, then the inner length would be 5 inches minus 2 inches (1 inch from each side), so 3 inches. Similarly, the inner width would be 6 inches minus 2 inches, which is 4 inches, and the inner height would be 4 inches minus 2 inches, which is 2 inches.

So, the inner dimensions of one box would be 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. Let me write that down:

Outer dimensions: 5x6x4 inches
Inner dimensions: (5-2)x(6-2)x(4-2) = 3x4x2 inches

Now, to find the inner volume of one box, I can calculate the volume of the inner dimensions. Volume is length x width x height, so that would be 3x4x2.

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 12*2 is 24. So, 3*4*2 is 24 cubic inches. So, each inner box is 24 cubic inches.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 3 inches length, 4 inches width, 2 inches height. 3*4 is 12, 12*2 is 24. Yeah, that's correct.

But, that seems right. So, each inner box is 24 cubic inches. Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume would be 3 times that.

So, 24 cubic inches per box times 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches. Wait, that seems right. 24*3 is 72. So, 72 cubic inches.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. Each box is 5x6x4, so the outer volume is 5*6*4, which is 120 cubic inches. The inner volume is 3*4*2, which is 24. So, 24 is 1/5th of the outer volume. So, 24*3 is 72, which is 1/5th of 120*3, which is 360. Wait, that seems right. 72 is 1/5th of 360, which is 120*3. So, 72 is correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total inner volume is 72 cubic inches.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, instead of calculating the inner volume directly, I could calculate the volume of the walls and subtract that from the outer volume. But, that seems right. Let me try that method to verify.

So, the outer volume is 5*6*4, which is 120 cubic inches. Now, the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the walls are on all sides, so the walls consist of the front, back, left, right, top, and bottom walls.

Wait, that seems right. So, the walls can be thought of as the outer surfaces minus the inner surfaces. So, the total volume of the walls would be the sum of the areas of the walls multiplied by their thickness.

But, that seems right. So, let me think about it.

Each box has 6 faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. But, that seems right. So, the front and back faces are each 5x4 inches, the left and right faces are each 6x4 inches, and the top and bottom faces are each 5x6 inches.

But, that seems right. So, the total outer surface
