Q: Jaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Jaime is placing eggs on a tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. He has 64 eggs and 2 trays. The question is asking how many eggs won't fit on the trays. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the total number of eggs that can fit on both trays. Since each tray holds 24 eggs and he has 2 trays, I should multiply 24 by 2. Let me write that down: 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays = 48 eggs. So, both trays together can hold 48 eggs.

Now, Jaime has 64 eggs in total. To find out how many eggs won't fit, I need to subtract the number of eggs that can fit from the total number of eggs he has. That means I should do 64 eggs - 48 eggs. Let me calculate that: 64 - 48 equals 16. So, 16 eggs won't fit on the trays.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 24 times 2 is indeed 48, and 64 minus 48 is 16. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays is 16. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, no, wait, that seems right. 64 minus 48 is 16. Yeah, okay, so 16 is correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each tray holds 24, two trays hold 48. He has 64, so 64 minus 48 is 16. Yeah, that's correct. So, 16 eggs won't fit.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 16. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of eggs that won't fit is \boxed{16}.

Jaime places eggs on trays, each of which can hold 24 eggs. He has 64 eggs and 2 trays. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we first calculate the total capacity of the two trays:

\[
24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we subtract the total capacity from the number of eggs Jaime has:

\[
64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}
\]

Thus, the number of eggs that won't fit on the trays is \boxed{16}.
