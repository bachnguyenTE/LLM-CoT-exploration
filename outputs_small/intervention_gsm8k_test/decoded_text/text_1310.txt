Q: Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?

Okay, so I have this relay race problem here, and I need to figure out how long Vanessa took to complete her part. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's parse the information given:

1. Aaron and Vanessa are on a relay team.
2. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
3. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did.
4. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
5. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
6. We need to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. In a relay race, each runner does a part of the race, and the total distance is the sum of all their parts. So, if there are two runners, the total distance is the sum of the distances each ran.

From point 3: Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did. So, if I let the distance Aaron ran be 'a' miles, then Vanessa ran '2a' miles. But, that seems right. So, if Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran half of that, which is 2 miles. Wait, that seems right. So, if Vanessa ran 4 miles, then Aaron ran 2 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, if Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron, then Aaron ran 2 miles. So, that's straightforward.

Now, moving on. Point 2: Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. So, if I let Vanessa's speed be 'v' miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is '2v' miles per minute.

Wait, that seems right. So, if Vanessa's speed is 'v', then Aaron's speed is double that, so 2v.

Now, point 5: Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. So, he ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. So, we can use that to find his speed.

Speed is distance divided by time, so for Aaron, his speed is 2 miles / 16 minutes. Let me compute that: 2 divided by 16 is 0.125 miles per minute. So, Aaron's speed is 0.125 mph? Wait, that seems right. 2 miles in 16 minutes is 0.125 miles per minute, which is 7.5 miles per hour. Wait, that seems right. 16 minutes is 1/3 of an hour, so 2 divided by (1/3) is 6, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2 miles in 16 minutes is 7.5 mph.

Wait, that seems right. 16 minutes is 1/3 of an hour, so 2 divided by (1/3) is 6, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
