Q: Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it. Let me try to break this down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can get a bit confusing, but, that seems right. Let me start by listing out all the events that happened and see how the number of fries changes each time.

First, Dave bought a large pack of fries. Let's call the total number of fries "F." That's our starting point.

Then, a seagull stole the pack out of his hand. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, the seagull took the entire pack, which is F fries. So, after the seagull stole it, the number of fries left would be zero. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, after the seagull stole it, there are zero fries left. But, that seems right. So, maybe I need to think about the next events.

Wait, that seems right. So, the seagull stole the entire pack, so the fries are gone. Then, Dave ate fourteen before the seagull stole it. So, he ate fourteen, so the number of fries left would be F - 14. Then, when the seagull stole it, he gobbled down half the amount of fries that Dave ate. So, Dave ate fourteen, so half of that is seven. So, the seagull ate seven fries. So, after the seagull stole it, the fries left would be (F -14) -7.

Wait, that seems right. So, the fries left after the seagull stole it would be F -14 -7, which is F -21.

Then, three pigeons came and each ate three fries. So, each pigeon ate three, so three pigeons would eat 3*3=9 fries. So, subtracting that, the fries left would be (F -21) -9 = F -10.

Then, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. So, the raccoon stole (2/3)*(F -10). So, the fries left after the raccoon stole would be (1 - 2/3)*(F -10) = (1/3)*(F -10).

Then, ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. So, ants took one fry, so the fries left would be (1/3)*(F -10) -1. And that's equal to five.

So, let me write that down as an equation:

(1/3)*(F -10) -1 = 5

So, let's solve for F.

First, add 1 to both sides:

(1/3)*(F -10) = 6

Then, multiply both sides by 3:

F -10 = 18

Then, add 10 to both sides:

F = 28

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of fries was 28.

But, that seems right. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with F.

Seagull stole the pack, so F is gone. Then, Dave ate 14, so F -14. Then, seagull ate half of Dave's 14, which is 7, so F -14 -7 = F -11.

Then, three pigeons ate 3 each, so 9 total, so F -1 -9 = F -10.

Raccoon stole two-thirds of that, so (1/3)*(F -10) left.

Then, ants took one, leaving five. So, (1/3)*(F -10) -1 =5.

So, (1/3)*(F -10) =6, so F -10=18, so F=28.

Wait, that seems right. So, 28.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 28.

But, that seems right. Let me think about the steps again.

Start with F.

Seagull steals, so F is gone.

Dave eats 14, so F -14.

Seagull eats half of Dave's 14, which is 7, so F -14 -7 = F -21.

Three pigeons eat 3 each, so 9, so F -21 -9 = F -10.

Wait, that seems right. So, F -10.

Raccoon steals two-thirds, so (1/3)*(F -10) left.

Then, ants take one, leaving five. So, (1/3)*(F -10) -1 =5.

So, (1
