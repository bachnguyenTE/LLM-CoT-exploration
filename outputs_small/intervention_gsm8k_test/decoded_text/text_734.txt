Q: Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  If Cindy carries all of her books at once, what will be the total weight of the books she is carrying?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cindy and her books. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, so Cindy has math, science, French, and English books. Each of her math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. Her French book is heavier, weighing 4 pounds, and her English book is 3 pounds. Then, her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. The question is asking for the total weight of all the books she's carrying when she puts them all at once.

Alright, let me break this down. First, let's list out all the books and their weights:

1. Math book: 2 pounds
2. Science book: 2 pounds
3. French book: 4 pounds
4. English book: 3 pounds
5. History book: twice as much as English book.

Wait, that seems right. So, the history book is twice the weight of the English book. Since the English book is 3 pounds, the history book must be 2 times 3, which is 6 pounds. So, history book is 6 pounds.

Now, let me list all the books with their weights:

- Math: 2
- Science: 2
- French: 4
- English: 3
- History: 6

So, to find the total weight, I need to add all these together. Let me write that out:

Total weight = Math + Science + French + English + History

Plugging in the numbers:

Total weight = 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6

Let me add them step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

First, 2 + 2 is 4.

Then, 4 + 4 is 8.

Next, 8 + 3 is 11.

Then, 11 + 6 is 17.

Wait, that seems right. So, adding them all up, the total weight is 17 pounds.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Math: 2

Science: 2

French: 4

English: 3

History: 6

Adding them: 2 + 2 is 4, 4 +4 is 8, 8 +3 is 11, 11 +6 is 17. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can add them in a different order to see if I get the same result.

Let me try grouping the books differently.

Math and Science: 2 + 2 = 4

French: 4

English: 3

History:6

So, 4 (Math+Science) + 4 (French) = 8

8 + 3 (English) = 11

11 +6 (History) =17

Same result. Okay, that's reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe I can add all the books except the history book first, and then add the history book.

So, Math:2, Science:2, French:4, English:3.

Adding those: 2 +2 is 4, 4 +4 is 8, 8 +3 is 11.

Then, adding the history book:11 +6 is 17.

Same answer. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 17 pounds is the total weight.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes in interpreting the problem.

The problem says: Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. So, each of her math and science books is 2 pounds. So, that's two books, each 2 pounds. So, 2 +2 is 4.

French book is 4 pounds, English is 3, and history is twice as much as English, so 6.

So, adding all together: 2 +2 +4 +3 +6.

Yes, that's 17.

Wait, that seems right. So, 17 pounds is the total weight.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

Math:2

Science:2

French:4

English:3

History:6

So, 2+2 is 4, 4+4 is 8, 8+3 is 11, 11+6 is 17.

Yes, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can add all the books except the history book first, which is 2+2+4+3=11, then add 6, which is 17.

Alternatively, maybe I can add all the books except the history book: 2+2+4+3=11, then add 6:17.

Same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can add all the books in a different order, like math
