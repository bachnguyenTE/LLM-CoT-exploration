Q: There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.  One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.  Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner.  How many penguins are still left sunbathing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about penguins sunbathing, and I need to figure out how many are left after some jump out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. Then, one-third of them jump into the ocean to swim. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. The question is, how many penguins are still left sunbathing?

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to find out how many penguins jump out in total and then subtract that from the original number to find out how many are left. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the total number of penguins is 36. So, one-third of them jump into the ocean. To find one-third of 36, I can do 36 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Then, another one-third go inside the cave. Again, one-third of 36 is 12. So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 penguins jump out of the ocean, and another 12 go into the cave. So, in total, how many penguins have left the sunbathing area? That would be 12 plus 12, which is 24 penguins.

So, if there were originally 36 penguins, and 24 have left, then the number remaining would be 36 minus 24. Let me do that subtraction. 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 36 divided by 3 is indeed 12. So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean. Then, another 12 go into the cave. So, 12 plus 12 is 24. 36 minus 24 is 12. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. If one-third jump out, that's 12 penguins, and another one-third, which is another 12, so 24 total. So, 36 minus 24 is 12. Yeah, same answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 penguins jump out of the ocean, 12 go into the cave, so 24 have left. 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are left sunbathing.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using fractions or something else?

Well, another way is to think about the fractions that remain. If one-third jump out, that leaves two-thirds. So, 36 times two-thirds is... let me calculate that. 36 times 2 is 72, and 72 divided by 3 is 24. So, 24 penguins have left, which is consistent with what I found before.

So, 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are left. That seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 36 penguins, one-third is 12, another one-third is 12, so 24 total. 36 minus 24 is 12. So, 12 penguins are left.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. So, if 1/3 jump out, and another 1/3 go into the cave, that's a total of 2/3 of the penguins have left. So, 2/3 of 36 is 24, so 36 minus 24 is 12.

Yeah, that's another way to think about it. So, 2/3 of 36 is 24, so 12 are left.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 penguins are left sunbathing.

Is there any chance I could have misread the problem? Let me check again.

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?"

So, 36, one-third jump out, another one-third jump out, so 24 have left, 12 remain. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 penguins are left.

Wait
