Q: Great Grandma Jones has three children.  And each of her children has three children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren.  And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.  If all of the family show up at the family reunion, how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Great Grandma Jones and her children, grandchildren, and great grand-babies. It seems like a family tree problem where each generation branches out into three more people. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the information given:

1. Great Grandma Jones has three children. So, that's the first generation.
2. Each of these three children has three children. So, each of the three grandchildren has three great grand-babies. That would be the second generation.
3. Each of these three great grand-babies has three babies. So, each of the three great grand-babies has three great great grand-babies. That would be the third generation.

The question is asking how many great grand-babies will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss. So, we need to find the total number of great grand-babies in the family.

Let me visualize this as a family tree. Great Grandma Jones is the root. She has three children, so that's generation one. Each of those three children has three children, so that's generation two. Each of those three grandchildren has three children, which would be generation three.

So, we need to calculate the number of individuals in generation three, which are the great grand-babies.

Let me write this out:

- Generation 0 (Great Grandma Jones): 1 person
- Generation 1 (Children): 3 people
- Generation 2 (Great Grandchildren): Each of the 3 children has 3 grandchildren, so 3 x 3 = 9 people
- Generation 3 (Great Grandbabies): Each of the 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies, so 9 x 3 = 27 people

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies is 27.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Starting with Great Grandma Jones, who has three children. Each of those three children has three children, so 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Each of those 9 grandchildren has three children, so 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Yes, that adds up. So, the total number of great grand-babies is 27.

I think that's the answer. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, we can think of it as each generation multiplying by 3. So, starting from Great Grandma Jones, each generation is 3^n, where n is the generation number.

But, that seems right. So, generation 0: 1, generation 1: 3, generation 2: 9, generation 3: 27.

So, yeah, 27 is the number of great grand-babies.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 27.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes.

Wait, that seems right. Each generation is 3 times the previous. So, starting from 1, 3, 9, 27. So, yeah, 27 is correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it as a tree, each node branches into three. So, the number of nodes at each level is 1, 3, 9, 27.

So, yeah, 27 is correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 27.

**Final Answer**
The number of great grand-babies at the family reunion will be \boxed{27}.

Great Grandma Jones has three children, who are the first generation. Each of these three children has three children, making the second generation. Each of these nine grandchildren has three children, making the third generation. 

To find the number of great grand-babies, we calculate the number of individuals in the third generation:

- Generation 0 (Great Grandma Jones): 1 person
- Generation 1 (Children): 3 people
- Generation 2 (Great Grandchildren): \(3 \times 3 = 9\) people
- Generation 3 (Great Grandbabies): \(9 \times 3 = 27\) people

Thus, the number of great grand-babies is \(\boxed{27}\).
