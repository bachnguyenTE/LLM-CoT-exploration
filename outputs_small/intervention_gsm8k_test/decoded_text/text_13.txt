Q: Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Okay, so I have this problem about Melanie and her vacuum cleaners. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, then sold 2 more to the red house. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. In the end, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. The question is, how many did she start with?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. It sounds like a word problem involving fractions and maybe some algebra. I think I need to set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let me denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \). That seems like a good starting point.

So, she sold a third at the green house. That means she sold \( \frac{1}{3}x \) vacuum cleaners. Then, she sold 2 more to the red house. So, after selling at the green house and red house, she has \( x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 \) left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that out:

After green house: \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \) or \( \frac{2}{3}x \). Then, she sold 2 more, so subtract 2: \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \).

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, half of \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) is sold at the orange house. That would be \( \frac{1}{2} \times (\frac{2}{3}x - 2) \).

So, after selling at the orange house, she has half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times (\frac{2}{3}x - 2) \). And according to the problem, she has 5 left. So, that gives me the equation:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times (\frac{2}{3}x - 2) = 5 \)

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that equation again:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5 \)

Okay, now I need to solve for \( x \). Let me simplify this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction on the left:

\( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10 \)

Wait, that seems right. Because 5 times 2 is 10.

Now, I can add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\( \frac{2}{3}x = 12 \)

Okay, so \( \frac{2}{3}x = 12 \). To solve for \( x \), I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{3} \), which is \( \frac{3}{2} \):

\( x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} \)

Calculating that, 12 divided by 2 is 6, and 6 times 3 is 18. So, \( x = 18 \).

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with \( x = 18 \). She sold a third at the green house, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \). So, she sold 6 vacuum cleaners at the green house. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, so that's 6 + 2 = 8 sold so far. 

Now, how many does she have left? 18 - 8 = 10. Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 10 is 5. So, she sold 5 at the orange house, leaving her with 5. That matches the problem statement. 

So, yes, 18 seems to be the correct answer. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the problem again to make sure I interpreted it correctly.

She sold a third at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She has 5 left. So, starting with 18, sold 6, 2, and 5, totaling 13, and 18 -13=5. That's correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 18.
