Q: Christina is planning a birthday party and needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, because 1/4 of attendees don't show up. She invited 16 friends. Gift bags are $2 each. How much will she spend?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the number of guests who will actually attend by calculating 75% of the 16 invited friends. This is done by multiplying 16 by 0.75, which equals 12 guests.

Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of attendees (12) by the cost per gift bag ($2), resulting in $24.

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of attendees:**
   
   Christina invited **16 friends**. Since only **75%** of the attendees show up, we calculate the number of guests as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 16 \times 0.75 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for gift bags:**
   
   Each gift bag costs **\$2**. Therefore, the total cost for **12** gift bags is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 \times \$2 = \$24
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{24}
\]
