Q: 44 seniors need to receive awards.  Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.  Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?

Okay, so I have this problem here about 44 seniors who need to receive awards. Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20. Then, each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds an extra 20% cost per frame. Also, 2 of the seniors will get pins that are $5 each. Additionally, 1/4 of the seniors are officers who will receive cords costing $12 each. I need to figure out how much will be spent on the senior gifts. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many picture frames there are. There are 44 seniors, and each gets a frame, so that's 44 frames. Each frame costs $20, so I can calculate the total cost for the frames by multiplying 44 by $20. Let me write that down:

Total cost for frames = 44 * $20.

Hmm, 44 times 20. Let me compute that. 44 times 20 is the same as 44 * 20. 44 * 20 is 880. So, the frames cost $880 in total.

Next, each frame needs to be etched with a logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. Wait, that seems right. So, 20% of $20 is the cost for the logo. Let me calculate that. 20% of 20 is 0.40. So, each frame now costs $20 plus $0.40, which is $20.40 per frame.

So, the total cost for the frames with logos would be 44 frames multiplied by $20.40 per frame. Let me compute that. 44 * 20.40 is 17.60, so 44 * 20.40 is 44 * 20 + 44 * 0.40. 44*20 is 880, and 44*0.40 is 17.60. So, 880 + 17.60 is 897.60. So, the total cost for the frames with logos is $897.60.

Wait, that seems right. So, the frames without logos are $880, and with logos, it's $897.60. So, the difference is $17.60, which is 20% of 20, so that makes sense.

Okay, moving on. Then, 2 of the seniors will receive pins that are $5 each. So, that's 2 * $5 = $10. So, pins cost $10 in total.

Now, 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will receive cords that are $12 each. So, first, let's figure out how many officers there are. 1/4 of 44 is 11. So, 11 officers. Each officer gets a cord costing $12. So, total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $12.

So, now, let me add up all these costs. The frames with logos are $897.60, the pins are $10, and the cords are $12. So, total cost is 897.60 + 10 + 12.

Let me compute that. 897.60 + 10 is 907.60, and then adding 12 gives 919.60. So, total cost is $919.60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 44 frames at $20 each: 44*20. 40*20 is 800, and 4*20 is 80, so 800 + 80 is 880. Correct.

Then, 20% of 20 is 0.40, so each frame is 20 + 0.40 = 20.40. So, 44 frames at 20.40 each. 44*20 is 880, 44*0.40 is 17.60, so total is 880 + 17.60 = 897.60. Correct.

Then, 2 pins at $5 each: 2*5=10. Correct.

1/4 of 44 is 11 officers, each getting a cord at
