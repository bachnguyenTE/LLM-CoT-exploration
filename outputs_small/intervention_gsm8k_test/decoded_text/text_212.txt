Q: Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Gary likes to walk around the edge of a rectangular park. The park is 1.5 miles by 6 miles, and he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. I need to figure out how many hours he spends walking. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the park is a rectangle, so it has two sides of one length and two sides of another length. The dimensions given are 1.5 miles and 6 miles. I should probably visualize this rectangle to make sure I understand the problem correctly. So, imagine a rectangle where one pair of sides is 1.5 miles long, and the other pair is 6 miles long.

Now, Gary is walking around the edge of this park. That means he's going along the perimeter of the rectangle. To find out how long it takes him to walk around the park, I need to calculate the total distance he walks and then divide that by his walking speed to get the time.

Alright, so the first step is to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2*(length + width). In this case, the length is 6 miles, and the width is 1.5 miles. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.

So, P = 2*(6 + 1.5). Let me compute the inside of the parentheses first. 6 plus 1.5 is 7.5. Then, multiplying that by 2 gives me 15. So, the perimeter is 15 miles. That means Gary is walking a total distance of 15 miles around the park.

Now, Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles at 3 miles per hour, I need to use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 15 / 3.

Calculating that, 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, it takes Gary 5 hours to walk around the park.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The perimeter is 2*(6 + 1.5) = 2*7.5 = 15 miles. That's correct. Then, time is distance divided by speed, so 15 miles divided by 3 mph is indeed 5 hours. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors here. The key steps were calculating the perimeter of the rectangle and then using the speed to find the time. It's straightforward once you remember the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.

Just to recap: perimeter = 2*(length + width) = 2*(6 + 1.5) = 15 miles. Time = distance / speed = 15 / 3 = 5 hours. Yep, that all adds up.

I wonder if there's another way to think about this problem. Maybe by breaking it down into walking each side of the rectangle separately. Let's see, if he walks along the length and the width, how much time would that take?

So, the park is 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. If he walks along the length, that's 6 miles, and then the width, which is 1.5 miles. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if he walks two lengths and two widths, that's the perimeter.

But, that seems right. So, if he walks two lengths, that's 6 + 6 = 12 miles, and two widths, that's 1.5 +1.5 =3 miles. So, total distance is 12 +3 =15 miles. So, same as before.

Alternatively, if he walks all four sides, it's 6 +1.5 +6 +1.5, which is 6 +1.5 is 7.5, plus another 6 is 13.5, plus another 1.5 is 15. So, same result.

So, whether I calculate the perimeter or add up all the sides, I get 15 miles. Then, time is 15 divided by 3, which is 5 hours. So, that's consistent.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I feel confident that the answer is 5 hours.

**Final Answer**
The time Gary spends walking is \boxed{5} hours.

To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the rectangular park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park has dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(
