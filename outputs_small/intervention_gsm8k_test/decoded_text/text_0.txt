Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Janet and her ducks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, every day, the ducks produce 16 eggs. Got that.

Then, she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. So, every day, she uses 3 eggs for breakfast. That means, out of the 16 eggs, 3 are consumed for breakfast. I should subtract that from the total to find out how many eggs are left after breakfast.

So, 16 eggs total minus 3 breakfast eggs equals... let me calculate that. 16 minus 3 is 13. Okay, so after breakfast, she has 13 eggs left.

Next, she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. So, she uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. I need to subtract those as well. So, 13 eggs minus 4 eggs for muffins equals... 13 minus 4 is 9. So, after breakfast and muffin baking, she has 9 eggs left.

Now, she sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, she sells 9 eggs each day. Each egg is sold for $2. To find out how much she makes, I need to multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg.

So, 9 eggs times $2 per egg. Let me do that multiplication. 9 times 2 is 18. So, she makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 for breakfast: 16 - 3 = 13.
3. She bakes 4 for muffins: 13 - 4 = 9.
4. She sells 9 eggs at $2 each: 9 * 2 = 18.

Yep, that all adds up. So, I think the answer is $18. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
