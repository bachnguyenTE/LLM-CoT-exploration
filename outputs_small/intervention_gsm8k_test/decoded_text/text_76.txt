Q: Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Okay, so Cecilia just got a new puppy, and she needs to figure out how many bags of dog food she'll use in the first year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that a year has 365 days, right? Wait, that seems right. I remember that a common year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days. But, that seems right. So, we'll go with 365 days for now.

Now, according to her vet, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Wait, that seems right. 180 days is less than a year, so that's the initial feeding period. Then, after that, she has to feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of its life. So, the rest of the year would be 365 minus 180 days.

Let me calculate how many days are in the second feeding period. So, 365 minus 180. Let me do that subtraction: 365 - 180. Hmm, 365 minus 180. Let me think, 180 plus 185 is 365, so 365 minus 180 is 185 days. So, the puppy will be fed 2 cups a day for 185 days.

Okay, so now I need to calculate the total amount of dog food she'll use. That would be the sum of the food used during the first 180 days and the food used during the next 185 days.

For the first 180 days, she feeds 1 cup each day. So, that's 1 cup/day multiplied by 180 days. Wait, that seems right. 180 days is 180 minus 10, so 180 minus 10 is 170, wait, that seems right.
