Q: John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.  How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John drinking water and solving puzzles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. I need to find out how many bottles he drinks in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku.

Alright, let's break this down. I think the key here is to figure out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku and then see how many half-hour intervals fit into that time. That should give me the number of bottles he drinks.

So, starting with the normal sudoku. It takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku is 4 times that long. Let me calculate the time for the extreme sudoku.

45 minutes multiplied by 4. Hmm, 45 times 4. Let me do that multiplication. 4 times 4 is 16, and 4 times 5 is 20, so 160? Wait, that seems right. 45 minutes times 4 is 180 minutes. Wait, that seems right. 45 times 4 is 180. So, 180 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. 45 minutes is 45 minutes, so 45 times 4 is 180 minutes. So, an extreme sudoku takes 180 minutes.

Now, John drinks a bottle every half hour. A half hour is 30 minutes. So, every 30 minutes, he drinks a bottle.

So, we need to find out how many 30-minute intervals fit into 180 minutes.

To do that, I can divide the total time by the interval. So, 180 divided by 30.

Let me compute that. 180 divided by 30. Hmm, 30 times 5 is 165, and 30 times 6 is 180. Wait, that seems right. 30 times 6 is 180, so 180 minus 180 is 0. Wait, that seems right. So, 180 is 30 times 6, so 180 is 30 times 6. So, 180 divided by 30 is 6.

Wait, that seems right. So, 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, 180 minutes is 6 half-hour intervals.

But, that seems right. So, 180 minutes divided by 30 minutes per bottle is 6 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. So, 180 minutes is 3 hours, and each bottle is every half hour, so 3 hours divided by 0.5 hours per bottle is 6 bottles.

So, that would mean John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 45 minutes for normal, 4 times that is 180 minutes for extreme. 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, 6 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 bottles.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, 45 minutes is 45, 4 times that is 180, 180 divided by 30 is 6. So, 6 bottles.

So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
John drinks \boxed{6} bottles of water in that time.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. 

First, we calculate the time taken for an extreme sudoku:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we determine how many half-hour intervals fit into 180 minutes. Since a half-hour is 30 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval:
\[
180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6
\]

Thus, John drinks \boxed{6} bottles of water in that time.
