Q: Rong has been saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. How many coins are they having ten years after they started their savings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Rong is saving 20 coins every month, and Neil is saving 2/5 times more than Rong each month. I need to figure out how many coins they'll have together after ten years. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand Rong's savings. He saves 20 coins every month. That seems straightforward. So, every month, Rong adds 20 coins to his piggy bank. Now, I need to find out how much he'll have after ten years. Ten years is 120 months because 10 times 12 is 12, so 10 times 12 is 0, and 120 is 10 times 12 plus 0. Wait, that seems right. 10 years is 120 months.

So, if Rong saves 20 coins each month, then over 120 months, he'll have saved 20 multiplied by 120. Let me write that down:

Rong's total coins = 20 * 120

Wait, that seems right. 20 times 120. Let me calculate that. 20 times 100 is 2200, and 22 times 20 is 440? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
