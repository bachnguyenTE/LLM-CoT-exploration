Q: Three teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 80 goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?

Okay, so I have this problem here about three teenagers playing soccer. It says that Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. And we know that Richie scored 80 goals. The question is asking how many goals all three teenagers scored in total.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's figure out how many goals Mark scored. The problem says Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Wait, that seems right. So if I let Mark's goals be M, then Richie's goals would be M + 20. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if Mark scored M goals, then Mark + 20 = 80. So, M + 20 = 80. Wait, that seems right. So, M = 80 - 20. Let me calculate that. 80 minus 20 is 60. So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Wait, that seems right. So, Mark scored 60 goals. Then, the problem also says that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, if I let Anna's goals be A, then A + 45 = 80. So, A = 88 - 45. Let me compute that. 88 minus 45 is 43. So, Anna scored 43 goals.

So, now we have all three scores: Mark scored 60, Anna scored 43, and Richie scored 88. So, to find the total number of goals, we just add them up. So, 60 + 43 + 88. Let me compute that. 60 + 43 is 103, and 103 + 88 is 201. So, the total number of goals is 201.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Mark: 88 - 20 is 68? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
