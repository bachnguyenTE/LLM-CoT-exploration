Q: Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 lollipops and shared the remaining equally with his four friends. How many lollipops did each of his friends receive?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many lollipops Ray has left after keeping 5 for himself. Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5, so I subtract 5 from 25 to find out how many are left.

25 minus 5 equals 20.

Next, I need to divide the remaining 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend gets, I divide 20 by 4.

20 divided by 4 equals 5.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

**Solution:**

Ray started with **25 lollipops**. He kept **5 lollipops** for himself and shared the remaining equally with his **four friends**.

1. **Calculate the remaining lollipops:**
   \[
   25 \text{ lollipops} - 5 \text{ lollipops} = 20 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Divide the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends:**
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ lollipops}}{4 \text{ friends}} = 5 \text{ lollipops per friend}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
