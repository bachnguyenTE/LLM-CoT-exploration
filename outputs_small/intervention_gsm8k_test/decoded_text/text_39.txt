Q: Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dana's running, walking, and skipping speeds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many miles she can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the information given. It says Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk. So, if I let her walking speed be something, her running speed would be four times that. Then, it also says she can skip at a rate that's half as fast as she can run. So, skipping speed is half of running speed. They also tell me that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. So, maybe I can work backwards from that to find her walking and running speeds.

Let me write down the given information:

1. Running speed is four times walking speed.
2. Skipping speed is half of running speed.
3. Skipping speed is 3 mph.
4. Time spent running is one-third of total time (6 hours), so that's 2 hours.
5. Time spent walking is two-thirds of total time, so that's 4 hours.

So, if I can find her running speed, I can find her walking speed, and then calculate the distance she covers while running and walking, then add them together for the total distance.

Let me denote:

- Let \( w \) be Dana's walking speed in mph.
- Then, her running speed is \( 4w \) mph.
- Her skipping speed is half of running speed, so that's \( \frac{4w}{2} = 2w \) mph.

But, that seems right. So, if her skipping speed is 3 mph, then:

\( 2w = 3 \) mph.

So, solving for \( w \):

\( w = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) mph.

So, Dana's walking speed is 1.5 mph, running speed is \( 4 * 1.5 = 6 \) mph, and skipping speed is 3 mph, which matches the given information.

Now, she spends one-third of the time running, which is 2 hours, and two-thirds walking, which is 4 hours.

So, the distance she covers while running is speed multiplied by time, which is 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Similarly, the distance she covers while walking is 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Therefore, total distance is 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Walking speed: 1.5 mph for 4 hours: 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

Running speed: 6 mph for 2 hours: 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

Total: 6 + 12 = 18 miles.

Yes, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 18 miles.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Walking speed: 1.5 mph.

Running speed: 4 * 1.5 = 6 mph.

Skipping speed: 3 mph, which is half of running speed (6 / 2 = 3). That's correct.

Time spent running: 2 hours, so distance: 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

Time spent walking: 4 hours, so distance: 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

Total distance: 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 18 miles.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total distance Dana can travel is \boxed{18} miles.
</think>

Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed. Her skipping speed is half of her running speed, which is given as 3 miles per hour. 

1. Let \( w \) be Dana's walking speed in mph.
2. Her running speed is \( 4w \) mph.
3. Her skipping speed is \( \frac{4w}{2} = 2w \) mph.
4. Given that her skipping speed is 3 mph, we have \( 2w = 3 \).
5. Solving for \( w \), we get \( w = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) mph.
6. Therefore, her walking speed is 1.5 mph, running speed is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) mph, and skipping speed is 3 mph.
