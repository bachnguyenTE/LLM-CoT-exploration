Q: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.

Okay, so Ali has some money saved up, right? He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. Hmm, let me figure out how much money he has in total. 

First, I know that each $10 bill is worth $10, so four of them would be 4 times $10. Let me write that down: 4 * $10 = $40. 

Then, he has six $20 bills. Each of those is $20, so six of them would be 6 * $20. Let me calculate that: 6 * $20 = $120. 

Now, to find the total amount of money Ali has, I need to add the money from the $10 bills and the $20 bills together. So, $40 + $120. Wait, that seems right. $40 plus $120 is $160. So, Ali has $160 in total.

Alright, next part: Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has. So, half of $160. Let me compute that. Half of 160 is 85, right? Because 160 divided by 2 is 85. So, Ali gives her sister $85.

Now, after giving her sister $85, how much money does Ali have left? Let me subtract that from the total. So, $160 - $85. Hmm, 160 minus 85. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 160 minus 80 is 80, and then minus 5 more is 75. So, after giving her sister half, Ali has $75 left.

Okay, now the next part is that Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. So, he has $75 left, and he uses 3/5 of that for dinner. Let me figure out what 3/5 of $75 is.

First, I can think of 3/5 as 0.6 in decimal form. So, 0.6 times 75. Let me compute that. 0.6 * 75. Hmm, 0.6 times 70 is 42, and 0.6 times 5 is 3, so 42 + 3 is 45. So, 3/5 of $75 is $45.

Wait, that seems right. So, Ali spends $45 on dinner. Now, to find out how much money he has left after buying dinner, I need to subtract the $45 from the remaining $75. So, $75 - $45. That's straightforward, 75 minus 45 is 30. So, he has $30 left.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. He started with $160, gave half to his sister, so he had $85 left. Then, he spent 3/5 of that, which is $45, so he has $30 remaining. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Starting amount: 4*$10 + 6*$20 = $40 + $120 = $160. Correct.

Half of $160 is $85. Correct.

$160 - $85 = $75. Correct.

3/5 of $75: 75 divided by 5 is 15, so 15*3 is 45. Correct.

$75 - $45 = $30. Correct.

So, yes, the final amount is $30.

I think that's all. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, Ali has $30 left after buying dinner.

**Final Answer**
The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \boxed{30}.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. To find the total amount of money he has, we calculate:

\[
4 \times 10 = 40 \quad \text{(from the $10 bills)}
\]
\[
6 \times 20 = 120 \quad \text{(from the $20 bills)}
\]
\[
40 + 120 = 160 \quad \text{(total amount of money)}
\]

Ali gives her sister half of the total money:
\[
\frac{160}{2} = 85 \quad \text{(amount given to her sister)}
\]

The remaining amount of money after giving her sister half is:
\[
160 - 8
