Q: Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many kilometers Michael did in total. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, Michael loves riding his bike. He rides it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks. Then, he decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he changed his routine. So, he rode 2 times a week, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he did that for 3 weeks. So, total weeks is 4 weeks plus 3 weeks, which is 7 weeks. Hmm, okay.

So, the problem is asking for the total kilometers he did. So, I need to calculate the total distance he covered in the first four weeks and then the total distance he covered in the next three weeks, and then add them together.

Let me write this down.

First part: He rode 5 times a week, 25 km each time, for 4 weeks.

So, each week, he rode 5 times, each time 25 km. So, per week, that's 5 * 25 km.

Let me compute that: 5 * 25 is 125 km per week.

He did this for 4 weeks, so total for the first part is 125 km/week * 4 weeks.

125 * 4 is 500 km.

Okay, so that's the first part.

Second part: He decided to ride only 2 times a week, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, he rode 2 times a week, 60 km each time, for 3 weeks.

So, per week, he rode 2 times, each time 60 km. So, per week, that's 2 * 60 km.

2 * 60 is 120 km per week.

He did this for 3 weeks, so total for the second part is 120 km/week * 3 weeks.

120 * 3 is 360 km.

So, now, to find the total kilometers, I need to add the first part and the second part together.

So, 500 km + 360 km.

500 + 360 is 860 km.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

First part: 5 times a week, 25 km each time. So, 5*25=125 per week. 125*4=500. That's correct.

Second part: 2 times a week, 60 km each time. So, 2*60=120 per week. 120*3=360. That's correct.

Total: 500 + 360=860.

So, the total kilometers is 860 km.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again.

He rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks: 5*25=125 per week, 125*4=500.

Then, he rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks: 2*60=120 per week, 120*3=360.

Total: 500+360=860.

Yes, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 860 kilometers.

**Final Answer**
The total kilometers Micheal did is \boxed{860}.

Michael rode his bike for two different periods. 

First, he rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each week for 4 weeks:
- Distance per week: \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers
- Total distance for 4 weeks: \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers

Next, he rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each week for 3 weeks:
- Distance per week: \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers
- Total distance for 3 weeks: \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers

Adding both distances together:
- Total distance: \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers

The total kilometers Micheal did is \(\boxed{860}\).
