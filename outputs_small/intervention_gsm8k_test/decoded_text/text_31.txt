Q: Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half the first one. A third says 25% more than the first one. What is their average guess?

Okay, so I have this problem where Gunter is trying to count jelly beans in a jar, and he's asking his friends for their guesses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says one friend says 80 jelly beans. That's straightforward. Then, another friend says 20 more than half the first one. Hmm, okay, so half of 80 is... let me calculate that. Half of 80 is 40, right? So if the first friend said 80, then the second friend is saying 20 more than that. So 40 plus 20 is 62. Wait, that seems right. So the second guess is 62.

Then, the third friend says 25% more than the first one. Hmm, 25% of 80 is... let me think. 10% of 80 is 0.88, so 25% would be double that, which is 1.76. So 80 plus 1.76 is 89.76. But, that seems right. So the third guess is approximately 89.76.

Wait, that seems right. So now, we have three guesses: 80, 62, and approximately 89.76. The question is asking for their average guess. So, to find the average, I need to add up all their guesses and then divide by the number of guesses, which is three.

Let me write that down. So, the first guess is 80, the second is 62, and the third is approximately 89.76. So, adding them up: 80 plus 62 is 142, and then 142 plus 89.76 is... let me calculate that. 142 plus 89 is 231, and then plus 0.76 is 231.76. So the total is 231.76.

Now, to find the average, I need to divide this total by 3. So, 231.76 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 3 goes into 231 how many times? 3 times 7 is 21, so 7 with a remainder of 10. Bring down the 1, making it 101. 3 goes into 103 thirty-four times because 3 times 34 is 102. So, 73.34? Wait, that seems right. So, 231.76 divided by 3 is approximately 77.25.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again. 80 plus 62 is 142, plus 89.76 is 231.76. Divided by 3 is 77.25. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me just verify each step again. First guess is 80, second is 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, plus 20 is 60. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
