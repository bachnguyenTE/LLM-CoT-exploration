Q: Conor lives near a beach and loves going there every day to have fun. On a particular week, he found 50 people at the beach on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were present at the beach than on the first day, and on the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. If Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Okay, so I have this problem about Conor and the people he sees at the beach each day. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. 

Conor lives near a beach and likes to go there every day for fun. One particular week, he saw 50 people on the first day. The next day, 20 more people were there than on the first day. On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day. For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day. I need to calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Alright, so let's break this down day by day.

**First Day:**
He saw 50 people. That's straightforward.

**Second Day:**
It says there were 20 more people than the first day. So, if the first day was 50, the second day would be 50 + 20. Let me calculate that.

50 + 20 = 70. So, on the second day, Conor saw 70 people.

**Third Day:**
This is a bit trickier. It says the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. Hmm, so twice the second day's count. Since the second day was 70, twice that would be 70 * 2.

70 * 2 = 140. So, on the third day, Conor saw 140 people.

Now, the rest of the week. Wait, that seems right. The problem says "the rest of the week." So, if the week has 7 days, and we've accounted for the first three days, that leaves 4 more days. 

It also says Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. So, I need to calculate the total for those 4 days and add them to the previous days.

Let me write down the days:

1. Day 1: 50
2. Day 2: 70
3. Day 3: 140
4. Day 4: 60
5. Day 5: 60
6. Day 6: 60
7. Day 7: 60

Wait, that seems right. So, days 4 to 7 are 4 days, each with an average of 60. So, the total for those days would be 4 * 60.

Let me compute that.

4 * 60 = 240. So, 240 people over the next four days.

Now, let me add up all the days:

Day 1: 50

Day 2: 70

Day 3: 140

Days 4-7: 240

So, total people = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240.

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them step by step.

First, 50 + 70 = 120.

Then, 120 + 140 = 260.

Then, 260 + 240 = 500.

Wait, that seems right. So, total people is 500.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check each day.

First day: 50. Second day: 50 +20=70. Third day: 2*70=140. Then, days 4-7: 4*60=240. So, 50+70=125, 125+140=265, 265+240=505. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
