Q: Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ford and his roses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Ford grows 40 roses every week. Hmm, wait, that seems right. 40 roses a week. Then he supplies roses to three flower shops. The first one orders 20 roses, the second orders 15 roses, and the third orders 30 roses per week. The question is asking how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. 

Alright, so I need to find out how many roses Ford needs in total to supply all three shops each week and then see how much he's short by in a month. Let me break it down.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by all three shops each week. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15, and the third orders 30. So, adding those up: 20 + 15 + 30. Let me do that math. 20 plus 15 is 37, and then 37 plus 30 is 67. So, all three shops together order 67 roses each week.

Now, Ford grows 40 roses every week. So, to find out how many roses he's lacking each week, I subtract the roses he grows from the roses he needs. That would be 67 minus 40. Let me compute that: 67 minus 40 is 27. So, Ford is short by 27 roses each week.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each week he's short by 27 roses. But, that seems right. So, if he needs 27 more each week, then over a month, how many would that be?

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, if he's short 27 each week, then over a month, which is typically 4 weeks, he would be short 27 times 4. Let me calculate that: 27 times 4. 20 times 4 is 80, and 7 times 4 is 28, so 80 plus 28 is 108. So, Ford is short 108 roses each month.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 108 roses. But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, the weekly orders: 20 + 15 + 30. 20 plus 15 is 35, plus 30 is 65. Wait, that seems right. 20 + 15 is 35, plus 30 is 65. So, 65 roses per week. Ford grows 40 roses per week, so 65 minus 40 is 25. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
