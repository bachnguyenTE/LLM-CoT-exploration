Q: At Ashley's school, they start a reforestation campaign where each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students and 3 teachers per class. How many trees will they have planted at the end of the campaign?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Ashley's school reforestation campaign. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that each child plants a tree and each teacher plants 2 trees. The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students and 3 teachers. I need to find out how many trees they'll plant in total.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think I need to find out how many students there are in total and how many teachers there are in total. Then, I can calculate how many trees each group will plant and add them together.

Starting with the students: there are 40 classes, each with an average of 25 students. So, to find the total number of students, I should multiply the number of classes by the average number of students per class. That would be 40 times 25. Let me write that down:

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class

Hmm, 40 times 25. I know that 40 times 2 is 80, so 40 times 25 is 200. So, there are 200 students in total.

Now, moving on to the teachers. Each class has an average of 3 teachers, so the total number of teachers would be 40 classes multiplied by 3 teachers per class. Let me calculate that:

Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class

40 times 3 is 120. So, there are 120 teachers in total.

Wait, that seems right. 40 classes with 3 teachers each is 120 teachers. Okay, so now I have the total number of students and teachers.

Next, each student plants one tree, so the total number of trees planted by students would be equal to the number of students. So, that's 200 trees.

Each teacher plants two trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers would be 2 times the number of teachers. Let me compute that:

Trees by teachers = 2 * Total teachers = 2 * 120

2 times 120 is 240. So, teachers plant 40 trees.

Now, to find the total number of trees planted, I need to add the trees planted by students and the trees planted by teachers. So:

Total trees = Trees by students + Trees by teachers = 200 + 40

200 plus 40 is 240. So, the total number of trees planted is 240.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total students: 40 classes * 25 students = 1000 students? Wait, that seems right. 40 times 25 is 1000. Wait, that seems right. 40*25 is 1000. So, 1000 students, each planting one tree, so 1000 trees.

Total teachers: 40 classes * 3 teachers = 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so 120*2=240 trees.

Adding them together: 1000 + 240 = 1240. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
