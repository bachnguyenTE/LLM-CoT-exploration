Q: The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth Sharon lost.  And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?

Okay, so I have this problem about Sharon and the tooth fairy. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the tooth fairy gives Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she gives her $1.00 each. After that, for the last two teeth, she gives half the amount she gave for each of the previous three teeth. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but, that seems right. Let me break it down.

So, the first tooth: $5.00. That's straightforward. Then, the next three teeth: each tooth is $1.00. So, three teeth would be 3 times $1.00. Let me calculate that. 3 * $1.00 is $3.00. So, that's $3.00. 

Now, the last two teeth. The problem says the tooth fairy gives Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Wait, that seems right. So, for each of the first tooth, she gave $5.00, and for each of the next three teeth, she gave $1.00. So, the amount per tooth for the last two teeth is half of $1.00, which is $0.50 per tooth. 

So, for the last two teeth, she gives $0.50 each. So, two teeth would be 2 * $0.50. Let me compute that. 2 * $0.50 is $1.00. 

So, now, let me add up all the money given to Sharon. First tooth: $5.00, next three teeth: $3.00, last two teeth: $1.00. So, total amount given is 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00. Let me add them up. 5.00 + 3.00 is 8.00, and then 8.00 +1.00 is 9.00. So, total is $9.000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. First tooth: $5.00. Then, three teeth at $1.00 each: 3 * 1.00 is 3.00. Then, two teeth at half of 1.00, which is 0.50 each: 2 * 0.50 is 1.00. So, 5 + 3 +1 is 9.00. So, total is $9.00.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the first tooth is $5.00, then three teeth at $1.00 each, so that's $3.00, and then two teeth at half of $1.00, which is $0.50 each, so that's $1.00. So, 5 + 3 +1 is 9. So, $9.00 total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00. So, the answer is $9.00.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes. So, first tooth: $5.00. Then, next three teeth: 1,1,1. So, 1+1+1 is 3. Then, last two teeth: 0.50, 0.50. So, 0.50 +0.50 is 1.00. So, 5 +3 +1 is 9. So, yes, $9.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00. So, the answer is $9.00.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The tooth fairy left Sharon \boxed{9.00} dollars.

Sharon received money from the tooth fairy in three parts: the first tooth, the next three teeth, and the last two teeth.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00.
2. For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. Therefore, the total for these three teeth is:
   \[
   3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]
3. For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for the previous three teeth. Half of $1.00 is $0.50
