Q: Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. If Samantha has 27 paintings, how many paintings does Kim have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I know that Samantha has 27 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. To find out how many Shelley has, I add 12 to Samantha's count: 27 + 12 = 39.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many Kim has, I subtract 8 from Shelley's count: 39 - 8 = 31.

Therefore, Kim has 31 painting.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Samantha's Paintings:**
   - Samantha has **27** paintings.

2. **Relationship Between Samantha and Shelley:**
   - Samantha has **12 fewer** paintings than Shelley.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     \text{Samantha's Paintings} = \text{Shelley's Paintings} - 12
     \]
   - Plugging in the known value:
     \[
     27 = \text{Shelley's Paintings} - 12
     \]
   - To find Shelley's paintings:
     \[
     \text{Shelley's Paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
     \]

3. **Relationship Between Shelley and Kim:**
   - Shelley has **8 more** paintings than Kim.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     \text{Shelley's Paintings} = \text{Kim's Paintings} + 8
     \]
   - Plugging in the known value:
     \[
     39 = \text{Kim's Paintings} + 8
     \]
   - To find Kim's paintings:
     \[
     \text{Kim's Paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
