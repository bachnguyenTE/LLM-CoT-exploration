Q: Patrick has three glue sticks that are partially used. One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left and the third one has 1/2 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, what is the total length of the glue sticks that are not used?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks, and each one is partially used. I need to find the total length of the glue sticks that aren't used. Each glue stick is originally 12 millimeters long. 

First, let me figure out how much of each glue stick is still unused. The first one has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left, and the third has 1/2 left. So, I need to calculate the unused length for each and then add them all together.

Starting with the first glue stick: it's 1/6 left. So, the unused length is 1/6 of 12 millimeters. To find that, I can multiply 12 by 1/6. Let me do that: 12 * (1/6) = 2 millimeters. Okay, so the first glue stick has 2 millimeters unused.

Next, the second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the unused length is 2/3 of 12 millimeters. Calculating that: 12 * (2/3) = 8 millimeters. Got it, the second one has 8 millimeters unused.

Now, the third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the unused length is 1/2 of 12 millimeters. That's straightforward: 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters. So, the third one has 6 millimeters unused.

Now, I need to add up all the unused lengths. That would be 2 millimeters (from the first) + 8 millimeters (from the second) + 6 millimeters (from the third). Let me add them step by step.

First, 2 + 8 is 10. Then, 18 + 6 is 24. Wait, that seems right. So, 2 + 8 is 10, and 10 +6 is 16? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2 +8 is 10, 10 +6 is 16. So, the total unused length is 16 millimeters.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First glue stick: 1/6 of 12 is 2. Second: 2/3 of 12 is 8. Third: 1/2 of 12 is 6. 2 +8 is 10, 10 +6 is 16. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the total length of the unused glue sticks is 16 millimeters.

**Final Answer**
The total length of the unused glue sticks is \boxed{16} millimeters.

Patrick has three glue sticks, each originally 12 millimeters long. The unused lengths of the glue sticks are calculated as follows:

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) of its length unused:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its length unused:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) of its length unused:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Adding these unused lengths together:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the unused glue sticks is \(\boxed{16}\) millimeters.
