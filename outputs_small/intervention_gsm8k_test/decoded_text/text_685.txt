Q: Catherine goes to the grocery store. She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. How many dollars does she pay in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately.

For apples, Catherine buys 1 kilo at $4 per kilo, so the total cost is 1 multiplied by 4, which equals $4.

Next, for bananas, she buys 2 kilos at $2 per kilo. Multiplying 2 by 2 gives a total cost of $4.

Then, for oranges, she purchases 2 kilos at $3 per kilo. Multiplying 2 by 3 results in a total cost of $6.

Finally, I add up the costs of all the fruits: $4 for apples, $4 for bananas, and $6 for oranges. Adding these together, $4 plus $4 plus $6 equals $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

**Solution:**

Catherine buys three types of fruits, and we need to calculate the total cost for each type before summing them up.

1. **Apples:**
   - **Quantity:** 1 kilo
   - **Price per kilo:** \$4
   - **Total Cost for Apples:** \(1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4\)

2. **Bananas:**
   - **Quantity:** 2 kilos
   - **Price per kilo:** \$2
   - **Total Cost for Bananas:** \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4\)

3. **Oranges:**
   - **Quantity:** 2 kilos
   - **Price per kilo:** \$3
   - **Total Cost for Oranges:** \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Apples:** \$4
   - **Bananas:** \$4
   - **Oranges:** \$6
   - **Total:** \$4 + \$4 + \$6 = **\$14**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
