Q: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. How many pounds of carrots will not be used?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is supposed to get 2 pounds of carrots. The question is asking how many pounds of carrots will not be used. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. Since each of the 40 restaurants is getting 2 pounds, I can calculate the total distributed by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each gets. So, that would be 40 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down:

Total distributed = 40 * 2

Hmm, 40 is the same as 40, right? So, 40 times 2 is 80. Wait, that seems right. 40 multiplied by 2 is 80. So, 80 pounds of carrots will be distributed.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 40 times 2 is 80. Yeah, that's correct. So, 80 pounds are going to the restaurants.

Now, the total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. So, to find out how many pounds will not be used, I need to subtract the distributed amount from the total amount. That makes sense because if we have more than enough, the difference will be the leftover.

So, the calculation would be:

Carrots not used = Total carrots - Distributed carrots
Carrots not used = 200 - 80

Let me compute that. 200 minus 80. Hmm, 200 minus 80 is 140. Wait, that seems right. Let me do it step by step to make sure.

200
- 80
------
Starting from the units place: 0 minus 8. Hmm, I can't do that, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The 0 becomes 10, and the 0 in the tens place becomes 9. So, 10 minus 8 is 2. Then, in the tens place, it's 9 minus 8, which is 1. So, putting it together, it's 140. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 200 minus 80 is 120, and then subtracting another 8 gives 112? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
