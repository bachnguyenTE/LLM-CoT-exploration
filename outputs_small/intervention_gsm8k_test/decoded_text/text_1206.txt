A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where John is getting a loan by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,0000. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. The house is worth $250,000. So, that's the total value of his home. Then, he gets a loan worth 40% of that. So, first, I need to figure out how much the loan is. 

Alright, so 40% of $250,000. Let me write that down. 40% is the same as 0.40 in decimal form. So, 0.40 multiplied by 250,000. Let me calculate that. 0.40 times 250,000. Hmm, 0.4 times 250,000 is... Well, 0.4 times 200,000 would be 80,000, and 0.4 times 50,000 is 20,000. So, adding those together, 80,000 plus 22,000 is 102,000. So, the loan is $102,000. 

Wait, that seems right. 40% of 250,000 is 102,000. Okay, so the loan is $102,000. Now, he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. So, he's using 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. So, 60% of $102,000. Let me calculate that. 0.60 times 102,000. 

So, 0.6 times 100,000 is 60,000, and 0.6 times 2,000 is 1,200. So, adding those together, 60,000 plus 1,200 is 61,200. So, he uses $61,200 to pay off his debts. 

Now, the question is asking how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts. So, he had a loan of $102,000, and he used $61,200 of it to pay off his debts. So, the leftover would be the total loan minus the amount used to pay off debts. 

So, 102,000 minus 61,200. Let me subtract that. 102,000 minus 61,200. 102,000 minus 60,000 is 42,000, and then minus another 1,200 is 40,800. So, the leftover is $40,800. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

First, the total loan is 40% of 250,000. 0.4 times 250,000 is indeed 102,000. Then, 60% of that is 0.6 times 102,000, which is 61,200. Subtracting that from the total loan: 102,000 minus 61,200 is 40,800. 

Hmm, so that seems correct. So, the leftover money John has after paying off his debts is $40,800. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. So, he had a house worth 250,000, got a loan of 40% of that, which is 102,000. Then, he used 60% of that loan to pay off his debts, which is 61,200. So, 102,000 minus 61,200 is 40,800. Yeah, that seems correct. 

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the answer is $40,800. 

**Final Answer**
The amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is \boxed{40800}.
