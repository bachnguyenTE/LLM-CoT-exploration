Okay, so I have this problem here where a family of parents and a child go to the cinema. The adult ticket costs $12, and a child ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3. I need to figure out how much they pay in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's identify the different items they are purchasing. There are two types of tickets: adult and child. The family consists of parents and a child, so that's three people in total. Wait, that seems right. Parents are two people, and the child is one, so three people altogether. So, they need to buy three tickets.

Now, the adult ticket is $12 each. Since there are two parents, that would be 2 times $12. Let me write that down: 2 * $12. Let me calculate that. 2 times 12 is 24. So, the two parents will cost $24 in total.

Next, the child ticket is $8. There's only one child, so that's just $8. So, the child's ticket is $8.

Now, let me add up the cost of the tickets. The parents' tickets are $24, and the child's ticket is $8. So, 24 plus 8. Hmm, 24 plus 8 is 32. So, the total cost for the tickets is $32.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2 parents at $12 each: 12 + 12 is 24. Child at $8: 24 + 8 is 32. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, they also buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3. So, I need to calculate the cost of the popcorns. That's 2 times $3. Let me write that: 2 * $3. Calculating that, 2 times 3 is 6. So, the popcorns cost $6.

Now, I need to add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns together to get the total amount they pay. So, the tickets are $32, and the popcorns are $6. So, 32 + 6. Let me add that. 32 plus 6 is 38. So, the total cost is $38.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the two parents: 2 * 12 = 24. Child: 1 * 8 = 8. Total tickets: 24 + 8 = 32. Popcorns: 2 * 3 = 6. Total: 32 + 6 = 38. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the total amount they pay is $38.

**Final Answer**
The total amount they pay is \boxed{38} dollars.

The family consists of two parents and one child, so they need to buy three tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8.

First, calculate the cost of the adult tickets:
\[
2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Next, calculate the cost of the child ticket:
\[
1 \times 8 = 8
\]

Add the cost of the tickets together:
\[
24 + 8 = 32
\]

They also buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3. Calculate the cost of the popcorns:
\[
2 \times 3 = 6
\]

Add the cost of the popcorns to the total cost of the tickets:
\[
32 + 6 = 38
\]

The total amount they pay is \boxed{38} dollars.
