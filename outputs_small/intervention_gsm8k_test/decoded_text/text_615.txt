Okay, so I need to figure out how much Scarlett spent at the yard sale and pet store. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, she found an aquarium for $10.00 at the yard sale. That seems straightforward. So, that's one item costing $10.00. 

Next, she went to the pet store and bought some things there. Let me list out what she bought:

1. 2 bags of rocks, each costing $2.50. Hmm, so that's 2 times $2.50. I should calculate that.
2. 3 pieces of coral, each costing $2.00. So, that's 3 times $2.00.
3. She also bought 20 fish at $0.50 each. That's 20 times $0.50.
4. Additionally, she needed fish food that cost $2.00.

So, I need to calculate each of these items and then add them all together to find the total amount she spent.

Let me start with the aquarium. That's $10.00, so I can note that down.

Now, the rocks. Each bag is $2.50, and she bought 2. So, 2 multiplied by $2.50. Let me compute that:

2 * $2.50 = $5.00. Okay, so the rocks cost $5.00.

Next, the coral. Each piece is $2.00, and she bought 3. So, 3 multiplied by $2.00:

3 * $2.00 = $6.00. Got that.

Then, the fish. She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each. So, 20 times $0.50. Let me calculate that:

20 * $0.50. Hmm, 20 times 0.50 is 10.00. So, the fish cost $10.00.

Lastly, the fish food. It's $2.00.

Now, I need to add up all these amounts to find the total she spent.

So, let's list them:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: $5.00
3. Coral: $6.00
4. Fish: $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, adding them all together:

Start with the aquarium: $10.00

Add the rocks: 10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00

Add the coral: 15.00 + 6.00 = 21.00

Add the fish: 21.00 + 10.00 = 31.00

Add the fish food: 31.00 + 2.00 = 33.00

So, adding all these together, the total amount she spent is $33.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Aquarium: $10.00. That's clear.

Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each. 2 * 2.50 is indeed 5.00. Correct.

Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each. 3 * 2.00 is 6.00. Correct.

Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each. 20 * 0.50. Let me compute that again. 20 * 0.50 is 11.00. Wait, that seems right. 20 * 0.50 is 11.00. So, $11.00.

Wait, that seems right. 20 * 0.50 is 11.00. So, $11.00.

Fish food: $2.00. Correct.

Adding them up:

10.00 (aquarium) + 5.00 (rocks) = 15.00

15.00 + 6.00 (coral) = 21.00

21.00 + 11.00 (fish) = 32.00

32.00 + 2.00 (fish food) = 34.00

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
