Q: A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?

Okay, so I have this problem about a company that sells fresh fruit, and I need to figure out the total price of a crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Each fruit has a different cost, and I need to calculate the total price based on that. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the given information:

- The crate has 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
- The price of an apple is $0.50.
- A banana costs twice as much as an apple.
- An orange costs three times as much as a banana.

So, I need to find the total cost of the crate by calculating the cost of each fruit type and then adding them all together.

Let me start by figuring out the cost per fruit:

1. **Apple:** Given as $0.50 each.
2. **Banana:** Since it's twice as much as an apple, I can calculate this by multiplying the apple price by 2.
3. **Orange:** Three times as much as a banana, so I'll need to first find the banana price and then multiply by 3.

Once I have the cost per fruit, I can multiply each by the number of fruits in the crate and then sum them up for the total cost.

Let me write this out step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of a banana.**

Given that an apple costs $0.50, a banana costs twice that. So,

Cost of banana = 2 * cost of apple
Cost of banana = 2 * $0.50
Let me compute that: 2 * 0.5 is 1.00, so $1.00.

Wait, that seems right. So each banana is $1.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of an orange.**

An orange is three times as expensive as a banana. Since a banana is $1.00, then:

Cost of orange = 3 * cost of banana
Cost of orange = 3 * $1.00
That's $3.00 per orange.

**Step 3: Now, calculate the total cost for each fruit in the crate.**

- **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00 each
- **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50 each
- **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00 each

Let me compute each of these.

**Bananas:**
5 bananas * $1.00 = $5.00

**Apples:**
12 apples * $0.50. Hmm, 12 * 0.5 is 6.00. So, $6.00.

**Oranges:**
7 oranges * $3.00. Let me compute 7 * 3 = 21. So, $21.00.

**Step 4: Add up all the costs to get the total price of the crate.**

Total cost = cost of bananas + cost of apples + cost of oranges
Total cost = $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00

Let me add these up:

First, $5.00 + $6.00 = $11.00

Then, $1.00 + $21.00 = $22.00

So, the total cost of the crate is $22.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

- **Bananas:** 5 * $1.00 = $5.00. Correct.
- **Apples:** 12 * $0.50. Let me compute 12 * 0.50. 10 * 0.50 is $5.50, and 1 * 0.55 is $0.55, so total is $6.05. Wait, that seems right. 12 * 0.50 is 6.00, so yes, $6.00.
- **Oranges:** 7 * $3.00. 7 * 3 is 21, so $21.00. Correct.

Adding them up: 5.00 + 6.00 is 11.00, plus 21.00 is 22.00. So, yes, $22.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total price for the crate is $22.00.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if I did everything correctly.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is
