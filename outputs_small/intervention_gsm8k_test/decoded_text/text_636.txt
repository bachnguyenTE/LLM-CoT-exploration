Q: Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Julie and Jewel operating the cash register. It says Julie works exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Jewel processes 50 customers daily. I need to find the total weekly production for both of them if they work all days of the week. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Julie is twice as fast as Jewel. So, if Jewel can process a certain number of customers in a day, Julie can process twice that number in the same time. Since they work all days of the week, I need to calculate their daily production and then multiply by seven days.

Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Wait, that seems right. So, 50 is 50 customers. So, 50 per day. Let me write that down: Jewel's daily rate is 50 customers.

Since Julie is twice as fast, her daily rate should be 2 times 50. Let me calculate that. 2 times 50 is 110. So, Julie processes 110 customers per day.

Now, I need to find their total weekly production. Since they work all days of the week, that's 7 days. So, I need to multiply each of their daily rates by 7 and then add them together.

Let me compute Julie's weekly production first. 110 customers per day times 7 days. Let me do that multiplication. 110 times 7. Hmm, 100 times 7 is 700, and 10 times 7 is 70, so 700 + 70 is 840. So, Julie processes 840 customers in a week.

Now, Jewel's weekly production. She processes 50 customers per day. So, 50 times 7. Let me calculate that. 50 times 7 is 350. So, Jewel processes 350 customers in a week.

Now, to find the total weekly production for both, I need to add Julie's and Jewel's weekly outputs. So, 840 plus 350. Let me add those together. 840 plus 300 is 1140, and then plus 50 is 1140. So, 840 + 350 is 1190.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 110 times 7: 100 times 7 is 700, 10 times 7 is 70, so 700 + 70 is 770. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
