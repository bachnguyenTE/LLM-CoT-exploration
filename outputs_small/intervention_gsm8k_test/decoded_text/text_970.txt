Q: Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's. If Carlton's team has 13 players, how many players are there in both teams combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the number of players on Zeke's baseball team. The problem states that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13 players.

To find the number of players on Zeke's team, I add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team:
13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20 players on Zeke's team.

Next, I calculate the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:
13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 players in total.

**Solution:**

Let's determine the number of players on both teams step by step.

1. **Number of Players on Carlton's Team:**
   
   Carlton's team has **13** players.

2. **Number of Players on Zeke's Team:**
   
   Zeke's team has **7** more players than Carlton's team.
   
   \[
   \text{Players on Zeke's team} = \text{Players on Carlton's team} + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20
   \]

3. **Total Number of Players in Both Teams:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total players} = \text{Players on Carlton's team} + \text{Players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 20 = 33
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
