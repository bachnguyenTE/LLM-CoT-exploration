Q: A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a candle melting over time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is: A candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM? Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like we're dealing with a candle that's burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and during that time, it melts at a constant rate of 2 centimeters per hour. So, I need to find out how much shorter the candle will be after that duration.

Alright, let's break this down. The time period from 1:0 PM to 5:0 PM is how many hours? Let me count. From 1:0 PM to 2:0 PM is 1 hour, 2:0 PM to 3:00 PM is another hour, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is another hour, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is the last hour. So that's 4 hours in total. So, the candle burns for 4 hours.

Now, the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour. So, if it's burning for 4 hours, the total amount it will melt is 2 centimeters multiplied by 4 hours. Let me write that down: 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm. So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:0 PM to 5:0 PM.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If it burns for 4 hours, and each hour it loses 2 cm, then 2*4 is indeed 8. So, yeah, 8 centimeters shorter. Hmm, is there any chance I miscounted the hours? Let me recount. From 1:0 PM to 2:0 PM is 1, 2:0 PM to 3:00 PM is 2, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 3, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4. So, 4 hours. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the duration in minutes to see if that changes anything. 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 60 minutes, 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is another 60 minutes, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is another 60, and 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is another 60. So, 60+60+60+60=240 minutes. But, that seems right. So, 240 minutes is 4 hours. So, 4 hours is 240 minutes. But, that seems right. So, 2 cm per hour, so 2*4=8 cm. So, 8 centimeters shorter.

Wait, that seems right. So, is the answer 8 centimeters? Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Maybe the burning time is from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, but, that seems right. So, 4 hours. So, 2 cm per hour, so 8 cm. So, yeah, 8 centimeters shorter.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer. So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:0 PM to 5:0 PM.

**Final Answer**
The candle will be \boxed{8} centimeters shorter.

The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns. We need to determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

First, we calculate the duration of the burning period:
- From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1 hour.
- From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is another hour.
- From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is another hour.
- From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is the last hour.

This gives a total of 4 hours.

Next, we calculate the total amount the candle will melt:
- The candle melts 2
