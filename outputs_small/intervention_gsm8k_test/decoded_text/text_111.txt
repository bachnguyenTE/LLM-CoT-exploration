Q: Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Okay, so I have this problem about Julia's boat and a leak. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the boat is taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rows back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, and the shore was 64 seconds away. I need to find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time she reached shore.

First, let me break down the information given. The boat is leaking water, and for every ten feet she rows, it takes two liters. So, the rate at which water is leaking is two liters per ten feet. That means, per foot, it's 2/10 liters, which simplifies to 0.2 liters per foot. But, that seems right. So, if she rows a certain distance, the total water taken would be the distance multiplied by 0.2 liters per foot.

But, that seems right. So, if she's rowing towards shore, the distance she needs to cover is 64 seconds. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
