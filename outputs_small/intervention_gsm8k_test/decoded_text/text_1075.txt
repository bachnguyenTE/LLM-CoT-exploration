Q: Jenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?

Okay, so Jenny is at the florist, and she wants to buy some roses. The roses are sold at $2 each and a dozen costs $15. She buys 15 roses, and she has five $5 bills. She only has quarters left for change. The question is, how many quarters does she leave with?

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how much she spends on buy the roses. She buys 15 roses, each costing $2. So, 5 times $2 is... let me calculate that. 5 * 2 = $10. So, she spends $10 on the roses.

Wait, that seems right. 5 roses at $2 each is $10. Okay, so she spends $10 on roses. Now, she also has some money in change. She has five $5 bills. So, how much money does she have in total? Each $5 bill is $5, so five times $5 is... 5 * 5 = $25. So, she has $25 in total.

But, that seems right. She has five $5 bills, so 5 * 5 = $25. So, she has $25 in total. She spends $10 on roses, so the change she should get is $25 - $10 = $15. So, she should get $15 in change.

But, that seems right. $25 minus $10 is $15. So, she should get $15 in change. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, she has $15 in change, and the question is, how many quarters does she leave with?

So, quarters are $0.25 each, right? So, each quarter is $0.25. So, to find out how many quarters she has, we need to divide the total change she gets by the value of each quarter.

So, she has $15 in change, and each quarter is $0.25. So, 15 divided by 0.25. Hmm, let me compute that. 15 / 0.25. Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so 15 divided by 0.25 is the same as 15 * 4, because 1/0.25 is 4. So, 15 * 4 is 60. So, 15 divided by 0.25 is 60. So, she gets 60 quarters.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 divided by 0.25 is 60. So, she has 60 quarters left. So, the answer is 60 quarters.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 15 roses at $2 each is 15*2=30. Wait, that seems right. 15*2 is 30. So, she spends $30 on roses. Wait, that seems right.
