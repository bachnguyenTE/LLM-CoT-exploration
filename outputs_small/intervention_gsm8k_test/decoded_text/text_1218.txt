Q: Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 – 7 and each year they are challenged to earn as many Accelerated Reader points as they can. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?

Okay, so I have this problem about Cedar Falls Middle School's Accelerated Reader points and escape rooms. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 10 students in each grade from 4 to 7, so that's 4 grades, right? Each grade has 10 students, so in total, there are 40 students. But, that seems right. Each year, they have these students challenge themselves to earn as many points as possible. The top 10 students (since there are 10 per grade) get to try an escape room set up by the teachers.

Wait, that seems right. So, each grade has 10 students with the most points, and they get to try the escape room. So, in total, how many students are trying the escape room? Since there are 4 grades, each with 10 students, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 students. So, 40 students in total are trying the escape room.

Now, the problem says that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, it's a group of 8. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. The question is, if every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?

Hmm, okay. So, we have 40 students trying the escape room, and each group can only have 8 students. So, how many groups do we need? Let me calculate that.

Number of groups needed = Total number of students / Number of students per group = 40 / 8 = 5 groups.

So, 5 groups are needed. Each group takes 45 minutes to escape. But, that seems right. So, if each group takes 45 minutes, and they all use their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to escape?

Wait, that seems right. If each group takes 45 minutes, and they all use their full time, then all 40 students will have tried the escape room in 45 minutes. So, the total time is 45 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 40 students divided into groups of 8, so 5 groups. Each group takes 45 minutes. So, if all groups are using their time, then the total time is 45 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 45 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. So, 40 students, 8 per group, 5 groups. Each group takes 45 minutes. So, all groups finish at the same time, so the total time is 45 minutes.

Alternatively, if the groups were to be staggered, but, that seems right. The problem says, "if every group uses their full 45 minutes," so if all groups are using their full time, then the total time is 45 minutes.

So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is \boxed{45} minutes.

First, we determine the total number of students trying the escape room. There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades, so:

\[ 4 \text{ grades} \times 10 \text{ students/grade} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the number of groups needed, with each group consisting of 8 students:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to escape. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes, the total time for everyone to try the escape room is:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is \boxed{45} minutes.
