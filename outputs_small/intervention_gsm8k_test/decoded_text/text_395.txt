Q: Erica made 20 Valentine's cards to pass out.  Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards that had 15 cards each.  She passed out 24 to her classmates, 5 to her family and received 17 from family and friends.  How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica now have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has initially. She made 20 cards herself, and her dad brought her 2 boxes with 15 cards each. So, I'll calculate the total by adding 20 to 15 and then multiplying by 2.

Next, I'll account for the cards she has passed out. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates, 5 to her family, and received 17 from family and friends. I'll add these amounts together to find out how many cards she has given away.

Finally, I'll subtract the total number of cards she has given out from the initial total to find out how many cards she has left.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica has now.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Cards Erica Started With**

- **Cards Erica Made:** 20
- **Cards from Her Dad:** 2 boxes × 15 cards per box = 10 cards

**Total Cards Initially:**  
\[
20 \text{ (her own)} + 10 \text{ (from dad)} = 30 \text{ cards}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Cards Given Out**

- **Cards Given to Classmates:** 24
- **Cards Given to Family:** 5
- **Cards Received from Family and Friends:** 17

**Total Cards Given Out:**  
\[
24 + 5 + 17 = 46 \text{ cards}
\]

### **Step 3: Determine the Number of Cards Erica Now Has**

Subtract the total cards given out from the initial total:  
\[
30 \text{ (initial)} - 46 \text{ (given out)} = 24 \text{ cards}
\]

\[
\boxed{24}
\]
