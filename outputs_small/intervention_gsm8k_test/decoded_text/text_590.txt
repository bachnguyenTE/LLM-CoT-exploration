Q: Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone. She invites 100 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?

Okay, so Alex is planning to attend an event and needs to figure out how many seats she'll need. She invited 100 people via email, and each of those invitees will invite 2 friends. Then she called 10 friends and invited them, and 8 of those friends said they'll bring their spouses. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, she starts by inviting 100 people via email. Each of these 100 invitees will invite 2 friends. So, I think that means each of those 100 people is going to add 2 more people. So, the number of friends invited by the email invitees would be 100 multiplied by 2. Let me write that down: 100 * 2 = 200. So, that's 220 friends? Wait, that seems right. 100 times 2 is 200, so 220 is the number of friends.

But, that seems right. So, the email invitees are 100, and each invites 2 friends, so 220 friends. So, that's 220 people.

Then, she calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, that's 10 more people. So, adding that to the previous number, 220 + 10 = 233.

Then, she calls 8 of her friends and says they'll be bringing their spouses. So, each of those 8 friends brings a spouse, which is another person. So, that's 8 more people. So, adding that, 233 + 8 = 241.

Wait, that seems right. So, total people invited are 241. But, that seems right. So, does that mean Alex needs 241 seats? Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. So, 100 email invitees, each inviting 2 friends: 100 * 2 = 200. Then, 10 called friends invited, 8 called friends bringing spouses. So, 200 + 10 + 8 = 218.
