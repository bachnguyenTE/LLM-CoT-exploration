Q: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less, each, because she had to complete some assignments. If the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days, how many hours did she sleep in total throughout the week?

Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then, for the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day because she had to do some assignments. After that, for the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. I need to find out how many hours she slept in total throughout the week.

Let me break this down step by step. First, let's figure out how much she slept each day.

On Monday, she slept 8 hours. That's straightforward.

Then, for Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day. So, if she slept 8 hours on Monday, then on Tuesday she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours. Similarly, on Wednesday, she also slept 6 hours because it's the same amount less.

So, let me write that down:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours

Now, the rest of the week. The week has 7 days, so after Monday and Tuesday, that's 2 days, so the rest of the week is 7 - 2 = 5 days. Wait, that seems right. So, from Thursday to Sunday, which is 5 days, she slept 1 hour more than those two days.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me clarify: for the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so those two days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Then, for the rest of the week, which is from Thursday to Sunday, she slept 1 hour more than those two days.

So, first, let's figure out how much she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday. As I calculated earlier, each was 6 hours. So, total for those two days is 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

Then, for the rest of the week, which is 5 days, she slept 1 hour more than those two days. So, each of those 5 days, she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours.

Therefore, total for the rest of the week is 5 days * 7 hours/day = 35 hours.

Now, let's add up all the days:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

So, adding them up:

8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 8 + 6 = 14.

14 + 6 = 20.

20 + 7 = 27.

27 + 7 = 34.

34 + 7 = 41.

41 + 7 = 48.

Wait, that seems right. So, total hours she slept in the week is 48 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way.

Total for the two days: 6 + 6 = 12.

Total for the rest of the week: 5 days * 7 = 35.

So, 12 + 35 = 47.
