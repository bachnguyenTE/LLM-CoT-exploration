Q: Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. How much does Jeff get in dollars?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Jeff and Brad are trying to split $100 between themselves. Jeff gets four times as much as Brad. Hmm, I need to figure out how much Jeff gets. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me denote the amount Brad gets as a variable. Let's say Brad gets B dollars. Then, since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, Jeff would get 4B dollars. That makes sense because Jeff's share is directly related to Brad's share.

Now, the total amount they have together is $100. So, if I add Brad's share and Jeff's share together, it should equal $100. So, mathematically, that would be:

B (Brad's amount) + 4B (Jeff's amount) = 100

Let me write that down:

B + 4B = 100

Combining like terms, that's 5B = 100.

So, to find the value of B, I can divide both sides of the equation by 5.

5B = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

B = 100 / 5

Calculating that, 100 divided by 5 is 20. So, Brad gets $20.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Brad gets $20, then Jeff gets 4 times that, which is 4 * 20 = 80. So, Jeff gets $80.

Adding both amounts together: 20 + 80 = 100. That adds up correctly.

Wait, that seems right. So, Jeff gets $80.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I can think of the total amount as being divided into parts. Since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, the total number of parts is 1 (for Brad) + 4 (for Jeff) = 5 parts.

So, each part is equal to 100 divided by 5, which is 20. So, each part is $20. Therefore, Brad gets 1 part, which is $20, and Jeff gets 4 parts, which is 4 * 20 = 80. So, that's the same result as before.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is $80 for Jeff.

Wait, that seems right. So, Jeff gets $80, Brad gets $20, and together they have $100.

Alternatively, I can think of it as ratios. The ratio of Jeff's money to Brad's money is 4:1. So, the total ratio is 4 + 1 = 5 parts. Each part is 100 / 5 = 20. So, Jeff's share is 4 * 20 = 80.

So, all methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I can be confident that Jeff gets $80.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward once you set up the variables correctly. Let me just recap:

Let B = Brad's amount.

Jeff's amount = 4B.

Total: B + 4B = 5B = 100.

So, B = 20, Jeff = 80.

Yep, that's solid.

I think that's the correct answer. So, Jeff gets $80.

**Final Answer**
Jeff gets \boxed{80} dollars.
</think>

Let \( B \) be the amount of money Brad gets. Since Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have together is $100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Thus, Brad gets $20. Jeff's amount is four times Brad's amount:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \boxed{80} dollars.
