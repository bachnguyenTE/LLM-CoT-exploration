Q: There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a class of 40 pupils. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, half of the class likes blue. So, if there are 40 pupils in total, half of them would be 40 divided by 2, which is 20. So, 20 pupils like blue. Got that down.

Now, the problem says that one-fourth of the remaining likes green. Hmm, so after the blue group, there are some left. Let me see, if 20 like blue, then the remaining number of pupils is 40 minus 20, which is 24. So, 24 pupils are left. One-fourth of these 24 likes green. Let me calculate that. One-fourth of 24 is 24 divided by 4, which is 6. So, 6 pupils like green.

Alright, so now we have 20 pupils who like blue and 6 pupils who like green. The rest of the pupils must like yellow. So, to find out how many like yellow, I need to subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils.

So, total pupils are 40, right? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
