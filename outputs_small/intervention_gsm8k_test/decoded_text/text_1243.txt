Q: Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag.  If Archie buys 1 bag while they're $3.00 off a bag, how much will each stick of jerky cost in cents?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Archie buying beef jerky. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the jerky comes in bags with 30 sticks each and costs $18.00 per bag. But, that seems right. Then, it mentions that they're $3.00 off a bag. Hmm, so does that mean the price is reduced by $3.00? I think that's how it's usually phrased. So, the original price is $18.00 per bag, and they're offering it for $18.00 - $3.00, which is... let me calculate that. 

$18.00 minus $3.00 is $15.00. So, the bag is now $5.00 instead of $18.00. That makes sense. So, the new price per bag is $5.00. Now, Archie buys 1 bag, so he's paying $5.00 for the bag. 

But, that seems right. So, the question is asking how much each stick of jerky will cost in cents. So, we need to find the cost per stick in cents. 

Alright, so let's break it down. First, the total cost for the bag is $5.00. The bag has 30 sticks. So, to find the cost per stick, we need to divide the total cost by the number of sticks. 

So, that would be $5.00 divided by 30 sticks. Let me write that down: 5.00 divided by 30. Hmm, 5 divided by 30. Let me think about that. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 divided by 30. Let me compute that. 5 divided by 30 is equal to... well, 30 goes into 5 zero times, so we add a decimal point and a zero, making it 50. 30 goes into 50 once, because 30 times 1 is 30, subtract that from 50, we get 20. Bring down another zero, making it 200. 30 goes into 200 six times because 30 times 6 is 180, which is less than 200. Subtract 180 from 200, we get 20. Bring down another zero, making it 200 again. So, it's repeating. So, 5 divided by 30 is 0.1666..., or 0.16 recurring. 

So, that's $0.1666... per stick. But, that seems right. So, each stick is approximately $0.1666. But, that seems right. So, now, the question is asking for the cost in cents. So, we need to convert dollars to cents. 

Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, so $0.1666... is equal to 16.666... cents. So, 16.666... cents per stick. But, that seems right. So, how do we express that? 

Well, 0.6666... is equal to 2/3. So, 16.6666... cents is equal to 16 and 2/3 cents. But, that seems right. So, each stick is 16 and two-thirds of a cent. 

But, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 16.666... cents per stick. But, that seems right. So, in the box, we need to write it as a number, probably as a fraction or a decimal. But, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, let me just recap. The original price is $18.00 per bag, but, that seems right. Then, they're $3.00 off, so the new price is $15.00 per bag. Then, 1 bag has 30 sticks, so each stick is 5.00 divided by 30, which is 0.1666... dollars, which is 16.6666... cents. So, that's 16 and two-thirds cents per stick. 

But, that seems right. So, is that the answer? 16.666... cents. So, in the box, we can write that as 16.666... or as a fraction. But, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, let me just make sure I didn't
