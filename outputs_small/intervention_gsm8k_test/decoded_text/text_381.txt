Q: Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Cho and Chloe hiking, and I need to figure out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?"

Alright, so Cho's speed is 14 km/h, and she hiked for 8 hours. Chloe's speed is 9 km/h, and she hiked for 5 hours. I need to find the difference in the distance they hiked.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to calculate the distance each of them hiked and then subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance to find out how much farther Cho went.

Distance is calculated by speed multiplied by time, right? So, for Cho, it's 14 km/h times 8 hours. For Chloe, it's 9 km/h times 5 hours. Then, subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's to get the difference.

Let me write that down step by step.

First, calculate Cho's distance:
Distance = Speed × Time
So, Cho's distance = 14 km/h × 8 hours.

Let me do that multiplication. 14 times 8. Hmm, 10 times 8 is 80, and 4 times 8 is 32, so 80 + 32 is 112. So, Cho hiked 112 kilometers.

Now, Chloe's distance:
Distance = Speed × Time
Chloe's speed is 9 km/h, and she hiked for 5 hours. So, 9 × 5.

9 times 5 is 45. So, Chloe hiked 45 kilometers.

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, I subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

Difference = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference = 112 km - 45 km.

Let me subtract that. 112 minus 45. Hmm, 112 minus 40 is 72, and then minus 5 more is 67. So, the difference is 67 kilometers.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For Cho: 14 km/h for 8 hours. 14 times 8. 10 times 8 is 80, 4 times 8 is 32, so 80 + 32 is 112. That's correct.

For Chloe: 9 km/h for 5 hours. 9 times 5 is 45. That's correct.

Difference: 112 minus 45. 112 minus 40 is 72, minus 5 is 67. Yeah, that's correct.

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't misread the problem. It says Cho hiked 14 km/h for 8 hours, Chloe hiked 9 km/h for 5 hours. So, yeah, 14 times 8 is 112, 9 times 5 is 45, difference is 67. Yeah, that seems right.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the answer is 67 kilometers.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{67}
</think>

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance Cho hiked, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

So, Cho's distance is:

\[
14 \,000 \text{ km/h} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 112 \text{ km}
\]

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance Chloe hiked, we use the same formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

So, Chloe's distance is:

\[
9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \,000 \text{ km}
\]

To find how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

\[
112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \,005 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{
