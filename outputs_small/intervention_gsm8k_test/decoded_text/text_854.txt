Q: A local town is expanding and wants to build several new homes across the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes. In the next year, they will build three times this many homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many homes the town will have built over the next three years. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, in the first year, they build 12 homes. That seems straightforward. So, Year 1: 12 homes.

Then, in the next year, they build three times this many. Hmm, so that would be 3 multiplied by the number from the first year. Let me write that down: Year2: 3 * 12. Let me calculate that. 3 times 12 is 36. So, Year2: 36 homes.

Now, the third year is a bit different. They count how many homes they have built so far and double the amount. Okay, so I need to add up the homes built in the first two years and then double that total for the third year.

So, let's add Year1 and Year2: 12 + 36. That equals 48. So, the total after two years is 48 homes.

Now, for the third year, they double that amount. So, 2 * 48. Let me compute that. 2 times 48 is 96. So, Year3: 96 homes.

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, I need to add up all three years: Year1 + Year2 + Year3.

That would be 12 + 36 + 96. Let me add them step by step. 12 + 36 is 48, and then 48 + 96 is 144. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Year1: 12, Year2: 36, Year3: 96. Adding them together: 12 + 36 is 48, and 48 + 96 is 144. Yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of homes built over the three years is 144.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

First year: 12. Second year: 3 times 12 is 36. Third year: 2 times (12 + 36) which is 2 times 48, which is 96. Then, adding all three: 12 + 36 is 48, plus 96 is 144. Yeah, that seems correct.

I think that's the answer. So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144.

**Final Answer**
The town will have built a total of \boxed{144} homes over the next three years.

In the first year, the town builds 12 homes. 

In the second year, they build three times this amount:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes} \]

In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes} \]

Adding up all three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

The total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]
