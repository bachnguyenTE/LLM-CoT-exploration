Q: Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?

Okay, so Heather has a big bag of raisins, and she wants to make three different things: oatmeal cookies, granola, and a snack mix. The question is asking how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make if she divides the raisins equally among all three. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the total amount of raisins she has is 27 cups. She wants to split this equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and the snack mix. That means she's going to divide the 27 cups into three equal parts. So, I should probably figure out how much raisins each of these three items gets.

To do that, I can divide 27 by 3. Let me write that down: 27 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 27 nine times because 3 times 9 is 27. So, each of the three items gets 9 cups of raisins. That makes sense because if you split 27 into three equal parts, each part is 9.

Now, the question is specifically about how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make. Each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, I need to figure out how many 3/4 cups fit into 9 cups of raisins.

To find out how many batches she can make, I can set up a division problem. The total amount of raisins she has for oatmeal cookies is 9 cups, and each batch requires 3/4 of a cup. So, the number of batches is 9 divided by 3/4.

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 9 divided by 3/4 is the same as 9 multiplied by 4/3. Let me compute that: 9 times 4 is 36, and 36 divided by 3 is 12. So, 9 divided by 3/4 is 12.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If each batch is 3/4 cup, then 12 batches would be 1.5 cups, 3 batches would be 2.25 cups, and so on. So, 12 batches would be 12 times 3/4, which is 9/2, which is 4.5 cups. Hmm, that's not 9. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
