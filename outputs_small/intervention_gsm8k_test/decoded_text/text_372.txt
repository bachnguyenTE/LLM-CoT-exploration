Q: Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class.  How many hours a week did she have dance practice?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says she had dance practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Tuesdays, it was 1 hour, and on Thursdays, it was 2 hours. So, I can calculate the total hours she practiced on these two days. 

Let me write that down:

- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours

So, adding those together: 1 + 2 = 3 hours. That means she practiced for 3 hours in total during the week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Now, the problem also mentions that on Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out how long her Saturday practice was.

Since Tuesday's practice was 1 hour, twice that would be 2 times 1 hour. Let me calculate that:

- Saturday: 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours

So, she practiced for 2 hours on Saturday.

Now, to find out the total number of hours she had dance practice in a week, I need to add up the hours from Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

Let me add them up:

- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

Total = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

On Tuesdays, it's 1 hour, Thursdays it's 2 hours, and on Saturdays, it's twice Tuesday's time, so 2*1=2 hours. Adding them together: 1+2+2=5. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, putting it all together, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours in a week.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is \boxed{5}.
