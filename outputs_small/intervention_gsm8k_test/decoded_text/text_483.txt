Q: Gabriel and Luri each own a portable media player that can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player while Luri has 3 times as many songs. How many fewer songs can Luri add to his player than Gabriel can add to his?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Gabriel and Luri each owning portable media players. Each can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel already has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many as Gabriel. The question is asking how many fewer songs can Luri add to his player than Gabriel can add to his. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, which can hold a total of 100. So, how many more songs can Gabriel add? Well, if the player can hold 100 songs and he already has 20, then the number of songs he can add is 100 minus 20. Let me write that down:

 Gabriel's remaining space = Total capacity - Current songs
 Gabriel's remaining space = 100 - 20
 Gabriel's remaining space = 80

So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs to his player.

Now, Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Since Gabriel has 20, Luri has 3 times that. Let me calculate that:

Luri's current number of songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's current number of songs = 3 * 20
Luri's current number of songs = 60

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player. Now, how many more songs can Luri add? Again, subtract his current number of songs from the total capacity:

Luri's remaining space = Total capacity - Current songs
Luri's remaining space = 100 - 60
Luri's remaining space = 44

So, Luri can add 44 more songs to his player.

The question is asking how many fewer songs can Luri add than Gabriel can add. That means we need to find the difference between Gabriel's remaining space and Luri's remaining space.

Difference = Gabriel's remaining space - Luri's remaining space
Difference = 80 - 44
Difference = 36

So, Luri can add 36 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Gabriel has 20 songs, so 100 - 20 is indeed 80. Luri has 3 times that, which is 60. 100 - 60 is 40. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 100 - 60 is 40, not 44. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
