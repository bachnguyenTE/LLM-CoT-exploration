Q: On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?

Okay, so Cindy went to the park for the Easter Egg Hunt and ended up with a basket full of eggs. The problem is asking how many eggs she had altogether. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me list out what information is given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.

Alright, so I need to find the total number of eggs she has, which is the sum of green, blue, pink, and yellow eggs. Let me break this down.

Starting with the green eggs: that's straightforward, it's 5.

Next, blue eggs. It says she had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Since green is 5, blue would be 2 times 5. Let me write that down:

Blue eggs = 2 * Green eggs = 2 * 5 = 10.

So, blue eggs are 10.

Now, moving on to pink eggs. It says she had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, if blue eggs are 10, then pink eggs would be 10 minus 1. Let me calculate that:

Pink eggs = Blue eggs - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

So, pink eggs are 9.

Next, yellow eggs. It says she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Since pink eggs are 9, yellow eggs would be 1/3 of that. Let me compute that:

Yellow eggs = (1/3) * Pink eggs = (1/3) * 9 = 3.

So, yellow eggs are 3.

Now, to find the total number of eggs, I need to add up all the eggs: green, blue, pink, and yellow.

Let me write that out:

Total eggs = Green + Blue + Pink + Yellow.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3.

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

First, green and blue: 5 + 10 = 15.

Then, pink and yellow: 9 + 3 = 12.

Now, add those two results together: 15 + 12 = 17.

Wait, that seems right. So, total eggs are 17.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check each step.

Green: 5. That's given.

Blue: twice as many as green. 2*5=10. Correct.

Pink: one fewer than blue. 10-1=9. Correct.

Yellow: one-third as many as pink. 9/3=3. Correct.

Total: 5+10+9+3.

5+10 is 15, 9+3 is 12, 15+12 is 27. Wait, that seems right. 5+10 is 15, 9+3 is 12, 15+12 is 27. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
