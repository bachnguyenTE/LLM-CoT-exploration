Q: John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $.40 per collection for each apartment.  How much money does he make in a week?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John collecting garbage from three different apartment complexes. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how much money he makes in a week. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem says there are three apartment complexes. The first two each have 200 apartments. So, that's 200 apartments for the first one and 200 for the second. The third one is 60% bigger than the other two combined. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many apartments are in the third complex.

Let me write that down. The first complex has 200 apartments, the second also has 200. So combined, that's 200 + 200. Let me calculate that: 200 + 200 is 400. So, the third complex has 60% bigger than 400 apartments. Wait, that seems right. So, 60% of 400 is how much? Let me compute that.

60% as a decimal is 0.60. So, 0.66 times 400. Let me do that multiplication. 400 times 0.6 is 240, and 400 times 0.06 is 240? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
