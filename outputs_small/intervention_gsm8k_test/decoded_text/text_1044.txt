Okay, so I have this problem here about Ava, Cole, and Xavier's heights after the summer. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that on the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. The question is asking for the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now.

Alright, so I need to find out how tall Cole and Xavier are now and then subtract their heights to find the difference. Let me break this down.

Starting with Xavier. He was 4 feet tall before the summer. Hmm, I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet would be 4 times 12 inches. Let me calculate that. 4 times 12 is 48 inches. So Xavier was 48 inches tall before the summer. Then he grew 3 inches over the summer. So his new height is 48 inches plus 3 inches. That should be 51 inches. Let me write that down: Xavier's current height is 51 inches.

Now, moving on Cole. He was 50 inches tall before the summer. He grew 2 inches over the summer. So his current height is 50 inches plus 2 inches. That should be 52 inches. So Cole is now 52 inches tall.

Now, I need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights. So that would be 52 inches minus 51 inches. Let me subtract that: 52 minus 51 is 51 inches. So the difference is 51 inches.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with Xavier: 4 feet is 48 inches, plus 3 inches is 51 inches. That seems correct. Then Cole was 50 inches, plus 2 inches is 52 inches. Subtracting 51 from 52 gives 1 inch. Hmm, so the difference is 1 inch. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe converting both heights to the same unit first. Let me try that. 

Xavier was 4 feet, which is 48 inches, and he grew 3 inches, so 48 + 3 = 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches, so 50 + 2 = 52 inches. Then, 52 - 51 is 1 inch. Yeah, same result. 

Wait, that seems right. So the difference is 1 inch. So the answer should be 1 inch. 

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any chance I messed up the units. 4 feet is 48 inches, correct. 50 inches is 50 inches, correct. 50 + 2 is 52, 48 + 3 is 51. 52 - 51 is 1. Yeah, that's correct. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the difference is 1 inch. 

**Final Answer**
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is \boxed{1} inch.
</think>

Xavier was 4 feet tall before the summer, which is equivalent to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches. He grew 3 inches, so his current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall before the summer and grew 2 inches, so his current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights is \(52 - 51 = 1\) inch.

\[
\boxed{1}
