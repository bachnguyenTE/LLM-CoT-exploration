Q: For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the items Elvira purchased.

She bought a computer with a screen, keyboard, and mouse, which cost €1090. Then, she added a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.

Next, I'll calculate the total expenditure by adding all these amounts together.

Finally, I'll subtract the total cost from her budget of €1500 to find out how much money she has left for her clothes.

**Solution:**

Elvira has a budget of €1500 and has spent money on several items. To find out how much she has left for her clothes, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - **Computer with screen, keyboard, and mouse:** €1090
   - **Scanner:** €157
   - **CD burner:** €74
   - **Printer:** €102

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \text{ euros}
   \]

2. **Subtract the total cost from the budget:**
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = 1500 - 1423 = 77 \text{ euros}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{77}
\]
