Q: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch all the Pokemon together. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. The problem gives me some relationships between how many each of them has caught. I need to figure out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me note down the information given:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.

I think the best way to approach this is by setting up some variables for each person's catch. Let me assign variables to each person:

Let A = number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

Let S = number of Pokemon Stan has caught.

Let D = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

Now, according to the problem:

1. A + S + D = 339. That's the total number of Pokemon caught.

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. So, A = S + 5.

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, S = 4D - 13.

Alright, so now I have three equations:

1. A + S + D = 339

2. A = S + 5

3. S = 4D -13

So, I can substitute the second equation into the first one, and then substitute the third equation into that. Let me do that step by step.

First, substitute A from equation 2 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + S + D = 339

Simplify that:

S + 5 + S + D = 339

Combine like terms:

2S + D + 5 = 339

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2S + D = 334

So, equation 4: 2S + D = 334

Now, from equation 3, we have S = 4D -13. Let me substitute that into equation 4.

So, 2*(4D -13) + D = 334

Let me compute that:

First, multiply out the 2:

8D -6 + D = 334

Combine like terms:

8D + D -6 = 334

So, 9D -6 = 334

Add 6 to both sides:

9D = 334 +6

9D = 340

Divide both sides by 9:

D = 340 /9

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute 340 divided by 9.

9*37=333, so 340-333=7, so D=37 and 7/9? Hmm, that's a fraction. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, that seems right. So, D = 340/9. Hmm, 340 divided by 9 is 37.777... So, 37.777... So, that's 37 and 7/9.

But, that seems right. So, D is 37 and 7/9. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, let me proceed.

So, D = 340/9.

Then, from equation 3, S =4D -13.

So, S =4*(340/9) -13.

Compute that:

First, 4*(340/9) = 1360/9.

Then, subtract 13. 13 is 117/9.

So, 1360/9 -117/9 = (1360 -17)/9 = 1343/9.

Wait, that seems right. So, S =1343/9.

Wait, that seems right. So, S is 1343/9.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

Wait, that seems right. So, S is 1343/9.

Wait, that seems right. So, 1343 divided by 9 is 149.222... So, 149 and 1/9.

Wait, that seems right. So, S is 149 and 1/9.

Wait, that seems right. So, that's the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught.
