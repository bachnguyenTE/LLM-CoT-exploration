Q: On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?

Okay, so I have this problem here about filling up helium balloons, and I need to figure out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that on a certain day, the total cost to fill 20 helium balloons was $900. So, if 20 balloons cost $900, I can probably find out the cost per balloon on that day. Let me write that down.

Total cost on the first day: $900
Number of balloons filled on the first day: 20

So, the cost per balloon on the first day would be total cost divided by the number of balloons, right? That would be 900 divided by 20. Let me calculate that.

900 ÷ 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 900 how many times? Well, 20 times 40 is 920, which is too much. So, 22 times 40 is 920, which is still more than 900. Wait, that seems right. Let me do it properly.

20 times 40 is 800, which is less than 900. So, 20 times 40 is 800. Subtract that from 900: 900 - 800 = 100. So, there's a remainder of 110. So, 22 goes into 110 exactly 5 times because 22 times 5 is 110. So, total is 40 + 5 = 45. So, 22.5? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
