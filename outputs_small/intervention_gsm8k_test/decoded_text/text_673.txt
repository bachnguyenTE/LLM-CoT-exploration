Q: Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to translate the words into a mathematical equation. The problem says Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. So, if I let the number of books Sally has be represented by a variable, say S, then twice that number would be 2S. Then, adding 3 to that would give me Janey's number of books, which is 21. So, putting that together, the equation should be:

2S + 3 = 21

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Sally has S books, twice that is 2S, and then 3 more would be 2S + 3. And we know Janey has 21 books, so 2S + 3 = 21. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, I need to solve for S. So, let's subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. That would give me:

2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3

Simplifying both sides, that becomes:

2S = 18

Okay, so 2S equals 18. Now, to find S, I need to divide both sides by 2. So:

2S / 2 = 18 / 2

Which simplifies to:

S = 9

So, Sally has 9 books. Let me just verify that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If Sally has 9 books, twice that is 18, and 3 more would be 21. Yep, that checks out. So, Sally has 9 books.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. Sometimes when I do these problems, I might mix up the operations. So, Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books. So, if Sally has S, then Janey has 2S + 3. And we know Janey has 21, so 2S + 3 = 21. Solving that, subtract 3: 2S = 18, then divide by 2: S = 9. Yeah, that seems consistent.

I guess another way to think about it is, if Janey has 21 books, which is 3 more than twice Sally's. So, subtract 3 from 21 to get twice Sally's books, which is 18, and then divide by 2 to get Sally's books, which is 9. That also makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. So, I think the answer is 9.

**Final Answer**
Sally has \boxed{9} books.

Let \( S \) be the number of books Sally has. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be translated into the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Thus, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books.
