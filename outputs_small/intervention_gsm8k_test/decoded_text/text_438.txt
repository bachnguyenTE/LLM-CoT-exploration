Q: Antoine's french onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount. His soup serves 6 people. The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round to the nearest integer.)
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He likes to double the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds. Doubling that gives him 4 pounds of onions.

Next, calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so 4 pounds will cost 4 multiplied by $2.00, which equals $8.00.

Then, find out how much beef stock he needs. He requires 2 boxes, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is 2 multiplied by $2.00, resulting in $4.00.

Add the costs of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost: $8.00 plus $4.00 equals $12.00.

Finally, determine the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings, which is 6. So, $12.00 divided by 6 servings equals $2.00 per serving.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup.

1. **Determine the Total Amount of Onions Needed:**
   
   - **Original Recipe:** 2 pounds of onions.
   - **Double the Amount:** \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) pounds of onions.

2. **Calculate the Cost of the Onions:**
   
   - **Price per pound:** \$2.00
   - **Total Cost for Onions:** \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Determine the Total Amount of Beef Stock Needed:**
   
   - **Number of Boxes:** 2
   - **Price per box:** \$2.00
   - **Total Cost for Beef Stock:** \( 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \)

4. **Calculate the Total Cost of Ingredients:**
   
   - **Total Cost:** \( \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \)

5. **Find the Cost per Serving:**
   
   - **Number of Servings:** 6
   - **Cost per Serving:** \( \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$0.3333 \text{ per serving} \)

6. **Round to the Nearest Integer:**
   
   - **Rounded Cost per Serving:** \$0.3333 ≈ \$0.33

\[
\boxed{0.33}
