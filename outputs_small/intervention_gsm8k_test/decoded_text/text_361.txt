Q: A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?

Okay, so I have this problem about a train traveling between three cities. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the train goes from the first city to the second, which is 75 miles. Then from the second to the third, that's 100 miles. Hmm, okay, so far so good. Now, it says it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance to go from the third city back to the first. Wait, that seems right. So, the distance from the third city to the first is 50 miles less than the sum of the first two legs.

Let me write that down. The distance from the first to the second is 75 miles, and from the second to the third is 100 miles. So, the combined distance is 75 + 100, which is 175 miles. Then, the distance from the third city back to the first is 50 miles less than that. So, 175 - 50 = 125 miles. Got it, so the third leg is 125 miles.

So, the train's trip is 75 miles, 100 miles, and 125 miles. Let me add those up to find the total distance for one trip. 75 + 100 is 175, and then 175 + 125 is 300. So, each round trip is 300 miles. Wait, that seems right. So, one way is 300 miles, so round trip is double that, which is 600 miles? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
