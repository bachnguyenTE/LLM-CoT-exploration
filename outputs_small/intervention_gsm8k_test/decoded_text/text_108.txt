Q: Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many cookies Henry baked last year. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. 

Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. But, that seems right. So, if he made, say, X cookies last year, this year he plans to make 2X cookies. 

However, when he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended. Hmm, so that means he baked 2X + 5 cookies this year. 

Then, he drops 5 of his cookies as he's putting them out to cool. So, from the total he baked this year, he drops 5. 

After that, he has a total of 110 cookies. So, the remaining cookies after dropping 5 is 110. 

I need to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, which is X. 

Let me try to write this out as equations. 

Let me denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year as X. 

He wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he planned to bake 2X cookies. 

But, that seems right. So, he intended to bake 2X, but, that seems right.
