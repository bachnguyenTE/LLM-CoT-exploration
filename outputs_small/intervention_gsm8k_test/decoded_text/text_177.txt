Q: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, Zaid earns $6000 per month. His expenses and donations are spread out in different parts of his salary. Let me list out all his expenses and see how much each part is.

1. **Rent**: He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. So, 1/4 of $6000. Let me calculate that. 1/4 of 6000 is 6000 divided by 4, which is 1500. So, $1500 goes to rent.

2. **Car Fuel**: He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. So, 1/3 of 6000. Let me compute that. 6000 divided by 3 is 2200. So, $2200 goes to car fuel.

3. **Charity Donation**: After paying for rent and fuel, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much he has left after rent and fuel first.

Let me subtract the rent and fuel from his total salary. So, $6000 - $1500 (rent) - $2200 (fuel). Let me do that subtraction step by step.

First, 6000 - 1500 is 4500. Then, 4500 - 2200. Let me subtract 2000 from 4500, which is 2500, and then subtract the remaining 200. So, 2500 - 200 is 2300. So, after paying for rent and fuel, he has $2300 left.

Now, he donates half of that to charity. Half of 2300 is 1150. So, he donates $1150 to charity.

4. **Given to Daughter and Wife**: He gives his daughter $2000 for weekly expenses and $7000 for his wife for groceries and household goods. Wait, that seems right. So, he gives $2000 to his daughter and $7000 to his wife.

Wait, that seems right. So, he gives $2000 to his daughter and $7000 to his wife. Let me add those up. 2000 + 7000 is 9000. So, he spends $9000 on his daughter and wife.

But, that seems right. So, let me tally up all his expenses and donations.

So, total expenses and donations:

- Rent: $1500
- Fuel: $2200
- Charity: $1150
- Daughter: $2000
- Wife: $7000

Let me add all these up.

First, let's add the smaller numbers to make it easier.

1500 + 2200 is 3700. Wait, that seems right. 1500 + 2200 is 3700.

Then, 3700 + 1150 is 4850. So, that's the total for rent, fuel, and charity.

Then, adding the daughter and wife's expenses: 4850 + 2000 + 7000.

Wait, that seems right. 4850 + 2000 is 6850, and 6850 + 7000 is 14550.

Wait, that seems right. So, total expenses and donations are $14550.

But, that seems right. Let me check again.

Wait, that seems right. So, if he earns $6000, and he's spending $14550, that would mean he's going into the negative, which is not possible. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through each step again.

First, rent: 1/4 of 6000 is 1500. Correct.

Fuel: 1/3 of 6000 is 2000. Correct.

Charity: half of the remaining after rent and fuel. So, 6000 - 1500 - 2000. Wait, that seems right. 6000 - 1500 is 45
