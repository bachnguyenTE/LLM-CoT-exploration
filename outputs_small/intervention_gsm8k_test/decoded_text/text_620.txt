Q: A DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. There are two DVDs in the public library, one has been played 356 times and the other has been played 135 times. How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?

Okay, so I have this problem here about DVDs and how many times they can be played before they break. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. That seems like a pretty long time, but, that seems right. I mean, a DVD can be played multiple times, right? So, each time you play it, it's like using up one of its 1000 capacity. So, if it's been played 356 times, that means it's been used up 356 times, and similarly, the other one has been played 135 times.

So, the question is asking how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break. Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to add up the number of times each DVD has been played and then subtract that from the total capacity of both DVDs. Wait, that seems right. Because each time you play a DVD, it's using up one of its capacity. So, if one has been played 356 times and the other 135 times, together they've been used 356 + 135 times. Then, subtract that from the total capacity of both to find out how many more times they can be played before they break.

Let me write that down to make it clearer. So, the total capacity is 1000 for each DVD, so together, both together have 1000 +1000 = 2000. Then, the total number of times they've been played is 356 +135. Let me calculate that. 356 plus 135. Hmm, 350 + 135 is 485, and then plus 6 is 491. Wait, that seems right. 356 +135: 300 +100 is 400, 50 +30 is 80, 6 +5 is 11. So, 400 +80 is 480, plus 11 is 491. Wait, that seems right. So, 356 +135 is 491. So, total number of times they've been played is 491.

So, the total capacity is 2000, and they've been used 491 times. So, the remaining capacity is 2000 -491. Let me compute that. 2000 -400 is 1600, then subtract 91 more. 1600 -91 is 1509. So, 1509 times. So, both DVDs can be played 1509 times before they break.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. So, 356 +135: 356 +100 is 456, then +35 is 491. That's correct. 2000 -491: 2000 -400 is 1600, 1600 -91 is 1509. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 2000 -491. 2000 -400 is 1600, 1600 -91 is 1509. Yeah, same result. So, that seems consistent.

So, the answer is 1509. So, both DVDs can be played 1509 times before they break.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think about it another way. If each DVD can be played 1000 times, then together, they can be played 2000 times. But, that seems right. So, if one has been played 356 times, and the other 135, that's 491 total. So, 2000 -491 is 1509. So, yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think 1509 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \boxed{1509}.

First, we note that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, together, both DVDs can be played \(1000 + 1000 = 2000\) times.

Next, we calculate the total number of times the DVDs have been played. The first DVD
