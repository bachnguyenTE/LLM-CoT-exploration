Q: Ali had $21. Leila gave him half of her $100. How much does Ali have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how much money Leila gave to Ali. Leila gave him half of her $100, which is $50.

Next, I add the $50 that Leila gave to Ali to the $21 that Ali originally had, resulting in a total of $51.

Therefore, Ali now has $51.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine how much Leila gave to Ali:**
   
   Leila gave Ali half of her \$100.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount given by Leila} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Ali has now:**
   
   Ali originally had \$21. Add the amount given by Leila.
   
   \[
   \text{Total amount Ali has now} = 21 + 50 = 51 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{51}
\]
