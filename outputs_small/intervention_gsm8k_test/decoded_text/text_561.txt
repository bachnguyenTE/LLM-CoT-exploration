Q: If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.  And their friend Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.  What is the average weight of the 3 friends?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the weights of three friends: Mark, Susan, and Bob. I need to find their average weight. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says Mark weighs 150 pounds. Wait, that seems right. It says 150 pounds. Okay, so Mark's weight is 150 lbs. Then it mentions Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Hmm, so Susan's weight is Mark's weight minus 20 pounds. Let me write that down.

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
So, Susan = 150 - 20
Let me calculate that. 150 minus 20 is 130. So Susan weighs 130 pounds. That seems straightforward.

Next, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. So Bob's weight is 2 times Susan's weight. Let me write that.

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
So, Bob = 2 * 130
Calculating that, 2 times 130 is 260. So Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, I have all three weights: Mark is 150, Susan is 130, and Bob is 260. I need to find the average weight of the three friends. To find the average, I remember that I have to add up all their weights and then divide by the number of people, which is 3 in this case.

So, let me add their weights together.

Total weight = Mark + Susan + Bob
Total weight = 150 + 130 + 260

Let me compute that step by step. First, 150 plus 130. Hmm, 150 + 130. Let me add the hundreds: 100 + 100 is 200. Then the tens: 50 + 30 is 80. So 200 + 80 is 280. Wait, that seems right. So 150 + 130 is 280.

Now, add Bob's weight to that. So 280 + 260. Let me do that. 200 + 200 is 400, and 80 + 60 is 140. So 400 + 140 is 540. So the total weight is 540 pounds.

Now, to find the average, I divide the total weight by the number of people, which is 3.

Average weight = Total weight / 3
So, Average weight = 540 / 3

Let me compute that. 540 divided by 3. 3 goes into 5 once, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the 4, making it 24. 3 goes into 24 eight times. Then bring down the 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, 540 divided by 3 is 180.

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Susan's weight: 150 - 20 is 130. That's correct.

Bob's weight: 2 * 130 is 260. That's correct.

Total weight: 150 + 130 + 260. Let me add them again. 150 + 130 is 280, and 280 + 260 is 546. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
