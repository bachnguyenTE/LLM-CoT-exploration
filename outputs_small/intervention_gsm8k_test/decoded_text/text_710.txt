Q: Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.00 apiece.  At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase.  What is Marcus' total bill?

Okay, so Marcus ordered some items and wants to know his total bill after getting a 10% discount. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out the cost of each type of item he ordered and then add them all up. After that, I'll apply the 10% discount to the total. Let me start with the croissants.

He ordered 5 croissants, each costing $3.000. So, to find the total for the croissants, I'll multiply 5 by $3.00. Let me do that: 5 times 3 is 15, so that's $15.00. Okay, so the croissants cost $15.00 in total.

Next, the cinnamon rolls. He bought 4 of them, each at $2.50. Hmm, 4 times 2.50. Let me calculate that. 4 times 2 is 8, and 4 times 0.50 is 2. So, 8 plus 2 is $10.00. So, the cinnamon rolls add up to $10.00.

Then, the mini quiches. He ordered 3 of them, each costing $4.00. So, 3 times 4 is 12. So, the mini quiches cost $12.00.

Lastly, the blueberry muffins. He bought 13 of them, each at $1.00. So, 13 times 1 is 13. So, the muffins cost $13.00.

Now, let me add up all these amounts to get the total before the discount. So, croissants are $15, cinnamon rolls are $10, mini quiches are $12, and muffins are $13. Let me add them one by one.

First, $15 plus $10 is $25. Then, $25 plus $12 is $27. Wait, that seems right. 15 + 10 is 25, plus 12 is 27. Then, adding the mini quiches: $27 plus $12 is $29. Wait, that seems right. 25 + 12 is 27, plus 12 is 29. Then, adding the muffins: $29 plus $13 is $22. Wait, that seems right. 29 + 13 is 42. Wait, that seems right. So, the total before discount is $42.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 5 croissants at $3 each: 5*3=15. 4 cinnings at $2.50: 4*2.50=10. 3 mini quiches at $4 each: 3*4=12. 13 muffins at $1 each: 13*1=13. So, 15+10=25, 25+12=37, 37+13=40. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 15+10 is 25, plus 12 is 37, plus 13 is 40. So, total before discount is $40.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5*3=15, 4*2.50=10, 3*4=12, 13*1=13. 15+10=25, 25+12=37, 37+13=50? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait
