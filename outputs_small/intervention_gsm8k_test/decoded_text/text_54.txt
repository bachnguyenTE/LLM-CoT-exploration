Q: The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about the Doubtfire sisters and their kittens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter. So, that's 7 kittens already. Then, their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens. 

Now, it mentions that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Hmm, so Patchy has had three times as many as the 7 kittens that were already adopted. That means I need to multiply 7 by 3 to find out how many kittens Patchy has now.

Let me write that down: 7 kittens adopted, and Patchy has had 3 times that. So, 7 multiplied by 3 is... 21? Wait, that seems right. 7 times 3 is 21. So, Patchy has 21 kittens now.

Then, it says Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens. Okay, so Trixie has 12 kittens. 

Now, the question is asking how many kittens the Doubtfire family now has. So, we have the 7 kittens that were adopted, plus the kittens that the two cats have had. 

So, let me add them up. The 7 kittens plus Patchy's 21 kittens plus Trixie's 12 kittens. 

Let me do the math: 7 plus 21 is 28, and then 28 plus 12 is 40. Wait, that seems right. 7 plus 21 is 28, and 28 plus 12 is 40. Wait, that seems right. 7 plus 21 is 28, plus 12 is 40. So, 40 kittens in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 7 kittens adopted, Patchy had 3 times that, which is 21, and Trixie had 12. So, 7 + 21 +12. 7 plus 21 is 28, plus 12 is 40. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40. Wait, that seems right. 7 plus 21 is 28, plus 12 is 40. Yeah, that's correct.

I think that's the answer. So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

**Final Answer**
The Doubtfire family now has \boxed{40} kittens.

The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

- Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.
- Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the 7 adopted kittens, the 21 kittens from Patchy, and the 12 kittens from Trixie:

\[
7 + 21 + 12 = 40
\]

Thus, the Doubtfire family now has \boxed{40} kittens.
