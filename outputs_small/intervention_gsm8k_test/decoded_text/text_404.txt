Q: Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. How many stripes do the zebras have on average?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here about zebras and their stripes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, Jane counts two zebras, each with 17 stripes. Then there's another zebra with 36 stripes, and another one with half that many stripes. I need to find the average number of stripes on all these zebras. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me list out all the zebras and their stripe counts. The problem says Jane counts two zebras, each with 17 stripes. So that's 17 stripes each. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. Half of 36 is... let me calculate that. Half of 36 is 18, right? So that's 18 stripes.

So, summarizing the counts: two zebras with 17 each, one with 36, and one with 18. So, how many zebras is that in total? Let me count: two plus one plus one is four zebras. So, four zebras in total.

Now, to find the average number of stripes, I need to add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras. So, let's add up the stripes. Two zebras with 17 each: 17 plus 17 is 34. Then, the third zebra has 36 stripes, so 34 plus 36 is 40. Wait, that seems right. 17 plus 17 is 34, plus 36 is 40? Wait, that seems right. Then, the fourth zebra has 18 stripes. So, 40 plus 18 is 58. Wait, that seems right. So, total stripes are 58.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 17 +17 is 34, plus 36 is 40, plus 18 is 58? Wait, that seems right. 34 +36 is 40, 40 +18 is 58. Yeah, that's correct.

So, total stripes: 58. Number of zebras: 4. So, average is total divided by number, which is 58 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 58 divided by 4 is 14. So, the average number of stripes is 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding. So, 17 +17 is 34, plus 36 is 40, plus 18 is 58. Yeah, that's correct. 58 divided by 4 is 14. Wait, that seems right. 4 times 14 is 56, which is less than 58. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
