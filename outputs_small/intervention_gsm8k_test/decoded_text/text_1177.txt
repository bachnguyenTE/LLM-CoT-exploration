Q: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. How many students are not on varsity?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Miss Albert's class. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the class has 12 boys and 12 girls. That means the total number of students is 12 plus 12, which is 24. Got that down. 

Now, the problem says that one-third of the girls are on varsity. Hmm, so I need to find out how many girls that is. Let me calculate that. If there are 12 girls and one-third are on varsity, then I can do 12 divided by 3. 

12 divided by 3 is 4. So, 4 girls are on varsity. That seems straightforward.

Next, it says one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Okay, so there are 12 boys, and one-fourth of them are on varsity. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So, 3 boys are on varsity. 

Now, I need to find out how many students are not on varsity. To do that, I should first find the total number of students on varsity and then subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

So, the total number of students on varsity is the sum of the girls on varsity and the boys on varsity. That would be 4 girls plus 3 boys. 

4 plus 3 is 7. So, 7 students are on varsity.

Now, the total number of students is 24, as I figured out earlier. So, the number of students not on varsity is 24 minus 7. 

24 minus 7 is 17. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with the number of girls: 12 divided by 3 is 4. That's correct. Boys: 12 divided by 4 is 3. That's also correct. Total varsity students: 4 + 3 = 7. Total students: 24. So, 24 - 7 = 17. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the number of students not on varsity directly? Let me try that.

For the girls, if one-third are on varsity, then two-thirds are not. So, 12/3 of 12 girls. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 3 is approximately 0.666..., so 0.666... times 12 is about 1.333. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 12 girls, 1.333 are not on varsity. 

Similarly, for the boys, if one-fourth are on varsity, then three-fourths are not. So, 3/4 of 12 boys. Wait, that seems right. 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 3/4 of 12 is 9. So, 9 boys are not on varsity.

So, total students not on varsity would be 1.333 girls plus 9 boys. Let me add those together. 1.333 plus 9 is 10.333. Hmm, that's approximately 10.333. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
