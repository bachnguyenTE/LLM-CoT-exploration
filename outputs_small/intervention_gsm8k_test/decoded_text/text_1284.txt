Q: An ice cream truck is traveling through a neighborhood. Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?

Okay, so I have this problem about an ice cream truck and children chasing it. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the ice cream truck starts at the beginning of the neighborhood. Then, children start chasing it. When the truck reaches the end of the first street, there are 5 children with it. That makes sense because the problem says "Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it." So, after the first street, 5 kids are following the truck.

Now, moving on to the second street. It says, "on the second street, each child in the existing group is joined by another child." Hmm, so if there are 5 children on the first street, on the second street, each child is joined by another child. That sounds like each child is paired with another, so maybe they form pairs? So, if there are 5 children, how does that work?

Wait, that seems right. If each child is joined by another child, that would mean each child is added to a pair. So, if there are 5 children, how many pairs can we make? Well, 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, 5 children on the first street, on the second street, each child is joined by another child. So, each child is paired with another, so that would mean 5 children would form 2 pairs and one child would be left alone? Or is it that each child is joined by another child, meaning each child is added to a group, so the number of children doubles?

Wait, that seems right. So, if you have 5 children, and each child is joined by another child, that would mean each child is added to a group, so the number of children becomes 5 times 2, which is 10. So, on the second street, there are 10 children.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5 children on the first street, then on the second street, each child is joined by another child, so 5 times 2 is 10. So, 10 children on the second street.

Then, on the third street, it says, "each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, each child is joined by another 2 children. So, does that mean each child is added to a group of 2? Or is it that each child is joined by another child, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if each child is joined by another 2 children, that would mean each child is added to a group of 2, so the number of children becomes 10 plus 2 times 10, which is 30? Wait, that seems right. So, 10 children on the second street, and on the third street, each child is joined by another 2 children, so each child is added to a group of 2, so the number of children becomes 10 + 2*10 = 30.

Wait, that seems right. So, 10 on the second street, then 30 on the third street.

But, that seems right. So, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, how many are now following the truck?

So, let me recap:

- Start: 0 children.

- After first street: 5 children.

- After second street: 5 * 2 = 10 children.

- After third street: 10 * 3 = 30 children.

Wait, that seems right. So, 5, then 10, then 30. So, 30? Wait, that seems right. So, the original 5 children give up, so the total number is 30.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 30.

Wait, that seems right. So, the original 5 children give up, so the total number is 30.
