Q: Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tins, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. How many more tins of cat food than dog food did Kimberly buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Kimberly bought some packages of cat food and dog food. I need to figure out how many more tins of cat food she bought compared to dog food. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I got all the details right. Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food has 11 tins, and each dog food package has 6 tins. The question is asking how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought. So, I need to calculate the total number of cat food tins and the total number of dog food tins, then subtract the two to find the difference.

Alright, let's start with the cat food. She bought 8 packages, and each package has 11 tins. So, to find the total number of cat tins, I should multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package. That would be 8 multiplied by 11. Let me write that down:

Total cat tins = 8 packages * 11 tins/package

Hmm, 8 times 11. I know that 8 times 10 is 80, and 8 times 1 is 8, so adding those together gives 88. So, 8 packages of cat food give her 88 tins. That seems right.

Now, moving on to the dog food. She bought 6 packages, and each package has 6 tins. So, similar to the cat food, I need to multiply the number of dog food packages by the number of tins per package. That would be 6 multiplied by 6. Let me write that:

Total dog tins = 6 packages *6 tins/package

Calculating that, 6 times 6 is 36. So, 6 packages of dog food give her 36 tins. That makes sense.

Now, the question is asking how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought. So, I need to subtract the total number of dog tins from the total number of cat tins. That would be:

Difference = Total cat tins - Total dog tins

Plugging in the numbers I just got:

Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins

Let me do that subtraction. 88 minus 36. Hmm, 88 minus 30 is 58, and then minus 6 more is 52. So, 88 minus 36 is 52. So, the difference is 52 tins.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 8 packages of cat food at 11 tins each: 8*11. 11*8 is 88, correct. Then, 6 packages of dog food at 6 tins each: 6*6 is 36, correct. Then, 88 minus 36: 88-30 is 58, 58-6 is 52. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 88 - 36. 36 plus 52 is 88, so yes, 52 is the difference.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just visualize it again. 8 packages of cat food, each with 11 tin. So, 8*11 is 88. 6 packages of dog food, each with 6 tins, so 6*6 is 36. 88 minus 36 is 52. Yeah, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 52 tins.

**Final Answer**
The number of additional cat food packages Kimberly bought is \boxed{52}.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food. Each package of cat food contained 11 tin, and each package of dog food contained 6 tins. To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the total number of cat food tins:
\[
8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tin/package} = 88 \text{ tins}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of dog food tins:
\[
6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text
