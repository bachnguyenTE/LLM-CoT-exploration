Q: While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?

Okay, so I have this problem here where there are forty customers at a restaurant, and each gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Then, Julieta received 10% less in tips than Rafaela. I need to find out how much money both of them received altogether. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how much Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave him a $20 tip, I can calculate that by multiplying 40 by 20. Let me write that out:

Rafaela's tips = 40 customers * $20 per customer.

Hmm, 40 times 20. Let me do that multiplication. 40 times 20... Well, 40 times 20 is the same as 40 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that. 40 * 20. 40 times 20 is 800. Wait, that seems right. Because 40 times 20 is like 40*20, which is 800. Yeah, that makes sense. So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Now, Julieta received 10% less than what Rafaela did. So, I need to find 10% of Rafaela's tips and then subtract that from his total to get Julieta's tips. Let me write that down.

First, find 10% of $800.

10% is the same as 0.10 in decimal form. So, 0.10 * 800.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that. 0.10 * 800. Hmm, 0.10 times 800. Let me think. 0.10 times 800 is 80. Because 0.10 is 10%, so 10% of 800 is 80. So, 0.10 * 800 is 80. So, 10% of 800 is 88.
