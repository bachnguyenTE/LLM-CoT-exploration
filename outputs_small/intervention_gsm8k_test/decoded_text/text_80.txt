Q: Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine how much water each girl received. Since there are two girls and the total water is 24 liters, each girl received 24 liters divided by 6, which is 4 liters.

Next, calculate the total water given to the two girls. Multiply the amount each girl received by the number of girls: 4 liters per girl times 2 girls equals 8 liters.

Then, add the water given to the boy. The boy received 6 liters, so the total water distributed is 8 liters plus 6 liters, totaling 14 liters.

Finally, subtract the total water distributed from the initial amount to find the remaining water. Subtract 14 liters from 24 liters, which leaves 10 liters.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the amount of water each girl received:**
   
   \[
   \text{Water per girl} = \frac{24 \text{ liters}}{6} = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total water given to the two girls:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters/girl} \times 2 \text{ girls} = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Add the water given to the boy:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total water distributed} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Find the remaining water:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{10 \text{ liters}}
\]
