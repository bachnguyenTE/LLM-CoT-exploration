Q: There are 27 unicorns left in the world.  One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.  Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.  How many female Scottish unicorns are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about unicorns, and I need to figure out how many female unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

It says there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. Then, two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. The question is asking how many female unicorns are there in the Scottish Highlands. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, the total number of unicorns is 27. That seems straightforward. Now, one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, I need to find out how many unicorns that is. To do that, I can calculate one third of 27.

Let me write that down: (1/3) * 27. Hmm, 27 divided by 3 is 9. So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Got that part.

Now, of these 9 unicorns, two thirds are female. So, I need to find two thirds of 9. Let me calculate that: (2/3) * 9. Hmm, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 3 times 2 is 6. So, that would mean there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 27 divided by 3 is indeed 9, and 9 divided by 3 is 3, multiplied by 2 is 6. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as fractions. If one third are in the Highlands, then two thirds are outside. So, 27 * (2/3) would give me the number of female unicorns. Let me compute that: 27 * 2 is 54, and 54 divided by 3 is 18. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
