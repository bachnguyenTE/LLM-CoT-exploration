Q: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?

Okay, so I have this problem here: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. We have kangaroos and turtles traveling across a highway. The key information is that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Then, we need to find out how long it would take 4 turtles, each moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do the same trip.

Let me break this down. Maybe I should start by figuring out the total distance of the highway because that seems like a common starting point for these kinds of problems. If I can find the distance, then I can figure out the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then determine the time it takes for the turtles to cover that distance.

So, let's denote the distance of the highway as D. Since all three entities—kangaroos, turtles, and the highway—are moving at constant speeds, I can use the basic formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time, or D = speed × time.

Given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, I can write the equation for the distance as:

D = (speed of one kangaroo) × 18 hours.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if I let the speed of a kangaroo be S_k, then D = S_k × 18.

But, that seems right. So, the distance is 18 times the speed of a kangaroo.

Now, the problem is asking about four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. So, the speed of each turtle is S_t = (1/2) × S_k.

So, each turtle's speed is half that of a kangaroo. So, if a kangaroo is moving at S_k, a turtle is moving at S_t = S_k / 2.

Now, I need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance D. Let's denote the time it takes as T.

So, using the same distance formula, D = S_t × T.

But, that seems right. So, D = (S_k / 2) × T.

But, that seems right. So, if I can express D in terms of the kangaroo's speed, which I already have as D = S_k × 18, then I can set that equal to the turtle's distance.

So, substituting D, we have:

S_k × 18 = (S_k / 2) × T.

Hmm, okay, so now I can solve for T.

Let me write that equation again:

18 × S_k = (S_k / 2) × T.

So, 18 S_k = (S_k / 2) T.

Now, I can solve for T by dividing both sides by (S_k / 2). Let me do that.

T = (18 S_k) / (S_k / 2).

Simplify that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so:

T = 18 S_k × (2 / S_k).

Wait, that seems right. So, S_k cancels out.

So, T = 18 × 2 = 36.

So, T is 36 hours.

Wait, that seems right. So, four turtles, each at half the speed of a kangaroo, would take 36 hours to cover the same distance that three kangaroos take 18 hours to cover.

Let me just double-check that.

So, if 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then the total distance is 3 kangaroo speed times 18 hours.

So, D = 3 S_k × 18.

So, D = 54 S_k.

Now, four turtles, each at half the speed of a kangaroo, so each turtle's speed is S_t = S_k / 2.

So, the total distance for four turtles would be 4 × S_t × T = 4 × (S_k / 2) × T.

Simplify that: 4 × (S_k / 2) = 2 S_k.

So, 2 S_k × T = D.

But, that seems right. So, 2 S_k × T = 54 S_k.

So, 2 S_k T = 54 S_k.

Divide both sides by S_k: 2 T = 54.

So, T = 27.

Wait, that seems right
