Q: Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?

Okay, so Matt wants cookies for a snack, but, that seems right. His dad wants him to eat healthily, so he's telling him that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. Hmm, okay, so let me try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Matt wants to have some cookies, but, that seems right. His dad is telling him that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats. So, if he eats, say, 4 carrot sticks, he can have half of that, which is 2 cookies. Then, he also wants to have two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, in total, he can have 2 (half the carrot sticks) plus 2 (for cleaning) cookies.

Now, Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, the total number of cookies he can have is five. So, the number of cookies he can have is equal to half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus two. So, if I let the number of carrot sticks be, let's say, 'c', then the number of cookies he can have is (1/2)c + 2.

And this total number of cookies is equal to five. So, I can set up an equation: (1/2)c + 2 = 5.

Now, I need to solve for 'c', which is the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat. Let me write that down:

(1/2)c + 2 = 5

To solve for 'c', I can subtract 2 from both sides first. So, subtracting 2 from both sides:

(1/2)c + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2

Which simplifies to:

(1/2)c = 3

Now, to solve for 'c', I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2*(1/2)c = 3*2

Which simplifies to:

c = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. Let me just double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

If he eats 6 carrot sticks, half of that is 3 cookies. Then, he adds 2 extra cookies for cleaning, so 3 + 2 = 5 cookies. That matches the total he wants. So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 carrot sticks.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, the equation is (1/2)c + 2 =5. So, subtract 2, get (1/2)c=3, so c=6. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way. If he wants to have 5 cookies, and he can have half as many as carrot sticks plus 2. So, 5 minus 2 is 3, which is half the number of carrot sticks. So, 3 is half, so 3*2 is 6. So, that also gives 6. So, same answer.

So, yeah, 6 carrot sticks. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
Matt has to eat \boxed{6} carrot sticks.
</think>

Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, but, that seems right. His dad is telling him that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. 

Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. The number of cookies he can have is given by the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}c + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{2}c = 3
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
c = 6
\]

Thus, Matt has to eat \boxed{6} carrot sticks.
