Q: Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies. Each lollipop costs $0.40, and the candies cost $3.20 in total. The question is asking how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost him. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Manolo already bought some items, and now we need to find out the cost for buying more of the same items. So, it's like scaling up the quantities. Instead of five lollipops and four candies, we need to find the cost for ten of each. That makes sense.

Let me break it down. I know the cost of one lollipop is $0.40. So, if he buys ten lollipops, I can calculate that by multiplying the cost of one by ten. Similarly, for the candies, I know the total cost for four is $3.20, so I can find the cost of one candy by dividing that by four, and then multiply by ten for ten candies.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down.

First, calculate the cost of ten lollipops:
Each lollipop is $0.40, so ten lollipops would be 10 * $0.40.

Let me compute that. 10 times 0.40. Hmm, 10 times 0 is 10, and 10 times 0.40 is 0.40. So, adding them together, 10 + 0.40 is $1.40. So, ten lollipops cost $1.40.

Okay, now for the candies. Four candies cost $3.20. So, each candy is 3.20 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 3.20 divided by 4. Hmm, 4 goes into 3.20 how many times? 4 goes into 3.20 zero times, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 4 goes into 3.20. Let me think.

Wait, that seems right. 4 times 0.8 is 3.220, which is close to 3.20. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
