Q: Bob thinks he needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument for his history project.  His favorite popsicles come 8 to a box and cost $2.00 per box.  How much will it cost Bob to build his project?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. He requires 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks.

Next, I'll calculate the number of boxes by dividing the total number of sticks by the number of sticks per box: 56 ÷ 8 = 6.75.

Since Bob can't purchase half a box, he'll need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 boxes.

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost will be 7 boxes multiplied by $2.00 per box: 7 × $2.00 = $14.00.

Therefore, Bob will spend $14.00 on popsicle sticks for his project.

**Solution:**

To determine how much Bob will spend on popsicle sticks, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   
   Bob needs **56 popsicle sticks** and each box contains **8 popsicle sticks**.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks per box}} = 7 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   Each box costs **\$2.0**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$14.0}
\]
