Q: Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client’s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?

Okay, so Kim is starting his own housekeeping business and wants to figure out his weekly profit. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, I need to understand all the components involved in calculating his profit.

He already has 3 clients, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. He's talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. So, in total, he's considering 3 + 5 = 8 clients. Hmm, that makes sense. So, he's planning to work with 8 clients in total.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. So, for each client, that's 2 bottles and 1 pack. Let me write that down:

- Bottles of bleach per client: 2
- Packs of cloths per client: 1

Now, the costs. Bottles of bleach are $2 each, and packs of cloths are $5 each. So, let me calculate the cost per client.

For each client:
- Cost of bleach: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5

So, total cost per client is $4 + $5 = $9.

He has 8 clients, so total expenses would be 8 * $9 = $72.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 8 clients, each costing $9, so 8*9 is indeed 72. Okay, so his total expenses are $72 per week.

Now, his total income is given as $92 each week. Wait, that seems right. So, $92 per week.

Profit is calculated as total income minus total expenses. So, Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses.

Plugging in the numbers: Profit = $92 - $72.

Let me compute that. 92 minus 72 is 20. So, $20 profit per week.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

First, total clients: 3 +5 =8. Correct.

Cost per client: 2*2 +1*5=4+5=9. Correct.

Total cost:8*9=72. Correct.

Total income:92. Correct.

Profit:92-72=20. Correct.

Hmm, seems straightforward. But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, Kim is making $92 income each week and spending $72 on supplies, so he's making $20 profit each week.

Is there any other cost involved? The problem says these are his only expenses, so no other costs. So, yes, profit is $20.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $20.

But, that seems right. Let me just think if I interpreted the problem correctly.

He has 3 clients, but, that seems right. He's talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. So, 3 +5=8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles and 1 pack. So, 2*8=16 bottles and 1*8=8 packs.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16 bottles at $2 each is 16*2=32. 8 packs at $5 each is 8*5=40. So, total cost is 32+40=72. So, same as before.

Total income is $92. So, 92-72=20. So, same result.

So, yeah, seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $20.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The profit Lucas will make each week is \boxed{20} dollars.

Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating his weekly profit. He has 8 clients in total (3 existing clients and 5 potential clients). Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

The cost calculations are as follows:
- Cost of bleach per client: \(2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = \$4\)
- Cost of cloths per client: \(1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$5\)
- Total cost per client: \(\$4 + \$5 = \$9\)

Total expenses for 8 clients:
- Total cost: \(8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72\)

Total income per week:
- Total income: \$92
