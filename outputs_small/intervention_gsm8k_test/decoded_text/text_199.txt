Q: Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mark being a copy-editor. He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, right? And he works for two different publishers. Each publisher pays him a different rate per sentence. The problem says that Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. Also, Mark is paid 5 cents per sentence by Publisher A. I need to figure out how much Mark makes in a week in cents.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. That's the total number of sentences he does. Now, he works for two publishers, so he must be splitting his work between them. Each publisher has a different rate, so the amount he gets paid will depend on how many sentences he edits for each publisher.

Let me denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as x. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences, the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B would be 1000 minus x, right? So that's 1000 - x.

Now, the payment for each publisher is based on the number of sentences he edits for them. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so the amount he gets from Publisher A would be 5 cents multiplied by x. That would be 5x cents.

For Publisher B, the payment is twice what Publisher A pays. So, if Publisher A pays 5x cents, Publisher B would pay 2 times that, which is 2 * 5x = 10x cents.

So, the total amount Mark makes in a week is the sum of what he gets from both publishers. That would be 5x (from A) plus 10x (from B). Let me write that out:

Total payment = 5x + 10x = 15x cents.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total payment is 15x cents. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, how do I find the total payment?
