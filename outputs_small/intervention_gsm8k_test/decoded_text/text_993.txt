Q: An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?

Okay, so I have this problem about an airport with two planes that fly multiple times a day. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are two planes. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. I need to find out how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day.

Hmm, let me parse this information. Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in a day as F. Then, the second plane flies 44 times, which is half of F. So, if I let F be the total flights of the first plane, then 44 = (1/2)F. That means F = 88. So, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Wait, that seems right. If the second plane's 44 trips are half of the first plane's, then the first plane must have 88 flights. So, F = 88.

Now, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, flights to Greece would be (3/4)F. Then, the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining flights would be (1 - 3/4)F = (1/4)F. Since these are split equally between France and Germany, each of those would be (1/4)F divided by 2, which is (1/8)F.

So, flights to France would be (1/8)F. Since F is 88, then flights to France would be (1/8)*88 = 11. Wait, that seems right. Let me check.

Wait, that seems right. So, flights to France would be 11. But, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, that seems right. So, flights to France is 11. So, the answer is 11.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the first plane flies 88 times a day. 3/4 of that is 66 flights to Greece. Then, the remaining 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so 11 each. So, yes, 11 flights to France.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 11.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's correct.
