Q: Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. If Frederick has 10 plants, how many plants does Shondra have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants. I need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many plants Frederick has. The problem says Frederick has 10 plants. That seems straightforward. So, Frederick = 10 plants.

Next, it says that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and then add that to Frederick's number to get the total number of plants for Toni.

Let me write that down. 60% of 10 plants. To calculate 60% of 10, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 0.60. So, 0.60 multiplied by 10.

Wait, that seems right. So, 0.60 * 10. Let me do that multiplication. 0.60 times 10. Well, 0.60 is the same as 60/100, but, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as 60% of 10. So, 60% is like 60 per 100, so 60/100. Wait, that seems right. So, 60/100 *10.

Wait, that seems right. So, 60/100 *10. Let me compute that. 60/100 is 0.6, and 0.6 times 10 is 6. So, 60% of 10 is 6. So, that means, 60% more than Frederick's 10 plants is 10 + 6 = 16 plants. So, Toni has 16 plants.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Frederick has 10 plants, 60% of that is 6, so adding that to 10 gives 16. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, if Toni has 16 plants, Shondra has 16 -7. Let me compute that. 16 minus 7 is 9. So, Shondra has 9 plants.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Frederick has 10 plants. 60% more than that is 10 + 6 = 16. Then, Shondra has 7 fewer than that, so 16 -7 =9. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way. Let me see.

If I let F be the number of plants Frederick has, which is 10. Then, T, the number of plants for Toni, is F plus 60% of F. So, T = F + 0.60*F = 1.60*F. So, T = 1.60*10 = 16. Then, Shondra has S = T -7 =16 -7=9.

Yeah, that's the same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of equations.

Let me denote:

F = 10

T = F + 0.60*F = 1.60*F

S = T -7

So, substituting F=10 into T, we get T=1.60*10=16.

Then, S=16-7=9.

So, that's another way to look at it, but, that seems right. So, Shondra has 9 plants.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the relationships as multiplicative factors.

Frederick has 10 plants.

Toni has 60% more than Frederick, so that's 1.60 times Frederick's plants.

So, 1.60 *10=16.

Wait, that seems right. 1.60*10 is 16.

Then, Shondra has 7 fewer than that, so 16 -7=9.

So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of fractions.

60% is equal to 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5. So, 3/
