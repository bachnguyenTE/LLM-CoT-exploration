Q: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Raymond and Samantha, who are cousins. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Hmm, okay, so if I can figure out when Samantha was born, I can add 6 years to that to find out when Raymond was born. 

Next, it mentions that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, that means when the son was 23, Raymond was 23 + 6 = 29 years old. Because he was born 6 years before Samantha. 

Now, the problem also states that Samantha is now 31. So, if I can find out how many years have passed since Samantha was born, I can figure out how many years ago the son was born. 

Let me write down what I know:

- Samantha is now 31.
- So, the number of years since Samantha was born is 31 - 0 = 31 years. Wait, that seems right. Because if someone is 31 now, they were born 31 years ago.

But, that seems right. So, if Samantha is 31, she was born 31 years ago. 

Since Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha, that means Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha was born. So, if Samantha was born 31 years ago, then Raymond was born 31 + 6 = 37 years ago. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. Then, since Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha, that would be 31 + 6 = 37 years ago. 

So, the son was born 37 years ago. 

Let me double-check that. If the son is 23 now, and he was born 6 years after Samantha, then Samantha is 23 + 6 = 29 years old. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if the son is 23 now, and he was born 6 years after Samantha, then Samantha is 23 + 6 = 29 years old. But, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago. So, the son was born 6 years after that, so 31 +6 = 37 years ago. 

So, the son was born 37 years ago. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 37 years ago. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. 

So, Samantha is 31 now, so she was born 31 years ago. Since Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha, that would be 31 +6 = 37 years ago. So, the son was born 37 years ago. 

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 37 years ago. 

I think that's correct. So, the son was born 37 years ago. 

**Final Answer**
The son was born \boxed{37} years ago.

Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23, which means he was 29 years old when the son was born (23 + 6). 

Samantha is now 31 years old, so she was born 31 years ago. Since Raymond was born 6 years after Samantha, Raymond was born 31 + 6 = 37 years ago.

Thus, the son was born \boxed{37} years ago.
