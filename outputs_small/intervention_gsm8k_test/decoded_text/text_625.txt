Q: Arianna plants a garden that has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. How many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. Right now, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. I need to figure out how many flowers have actually bloomed. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me find out the total number of flowers in the garden. There are 10 rows, each with 20 flowers. So, I think I need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row. That would be 10 multiplied by 20. Let me write that out:

Total flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
Total flowers = 10 × 20

Hmm, 10 times 20. Well, 10 times 20 is 220. So, there are 220 flowers in total in the garden. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem says that only 4/5 of these flowers have bloomed. So, I need to find 4/5 of 220. To How do I do that? I think I need to multiply 220 by 4/5. Let me write that down:

Bloomed flowers = Total flowers × (4/5)
Bloomed flowers = 220 × (4/5)

Hmm, okay, so 220 multiplied by 4/5. Let me think about how to compute that. Maybe I can simplify the multiplication by dividing 220 by 5 first and then multiplying by 4. That might be easier.

So, 220 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 goes into 220 how many times? 5 times 40 is 200, so that's 44. So, 220 divided by 5 is 44. Then, I multiply that by 4. 44 times 4 is 176. So, 220 multiplied by 4/5 is 176.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If 1/5 of 220 is 44, then 4/5 would be 4 times that, which is 176. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 44 times 4 is 176. So, yes, 176 flowers have bloomed.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 10 rows, each with 20 flowers, so 220 total. 4/5 of 220 is 176. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of 4/5 as 0.8. So, 220 multiplied by 0.8. Let me compute that. 220 times 0.8. 220 times 0.8 is the same as 220 times 8 divided by 10. So, 220 times 8 is 1760, divided by 10 is 176. So, same result. So, that's consistent.

So, whether I do it by dividing first or multiplying first, I get the same answer, 176. So, that seems solid.

Wait, that seems right. So, 4/5 of 220 is 176. So, 176 flowers have bloomed.

But, that seems right. Let me think about another way. If 1/5 of the flowers have not bloomed, then 1/5 is 44, so 44 flowers are not bloomed, and 220 minus 44 is 176. So, that also gives me 176. So, that's another way to think about it.

So, that's consistent. So, 176 is the number of flowers that have bloomed.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

But, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that the number of flowers that have bloomed is 176.

**Final Answer**
The number of flowers that have bloomed is \boxed{176}.

Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers, with each row containing 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = 10 \times 22 = 220
\]

Currently, only \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of blo
