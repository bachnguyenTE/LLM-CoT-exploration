Q: When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Billy and Sally's salaries, and I need to figure out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working for 20 hours, which I think is 20 hours, but, that seems right. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's parse the information given. Billy was hired with a starting salary of $10.50 per hour. Then, after 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour. Sally, on the other hand, just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary. So, Sally's starting salary is $1.00 per hour because Billy started at $1.00, and Sally is $0.50 higher.

Now, both Billy and Sally work 20 hours. Wait, that seems right. 20 hours is 20 hours? Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but, that seems right. So, both work 20 hours. The question is, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally?

So, I need to calculate Billy's total earnings and Sally's total earnings over 20 hours, and then find the difference between the two.

Let me start with Billy's earnings. He started at $1.00 per hour, then got a raise after 2 months, and then another raise on his first anniversary. So, his salary changes over time.

First, let's figure out when each raise was given. The problem says:
