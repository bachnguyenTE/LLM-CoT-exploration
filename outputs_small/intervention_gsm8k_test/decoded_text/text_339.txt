Q: Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens as cows. How many legs do the animals have, all together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Farmer Brown and his animals. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, and all of them are either chickens or cows. That's straightforward. Then it mentions that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Hmm, okay, so chickens are in larger numbers compared to cows. I need to find out how many legs all the animals have together.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I should start by figuring out how many chickens and how many cows there are. Since all the animals are either chickens or cows, the total number of animals is the sum of chickens and cows. 

Let me denote the number of cows as C. Then, since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens would be 2C. So, the total number of animals is C (cows) plus 2C (chickens), which equals 3C. 

But, that seems right. So, 3C equals 60 animals. Wait, that seems right. So, 3C = 60. Hmm, let me write that down:

3C = 60

Wait, that seems right. So, to find C, I can divide both sides by 3. So, C = 60 / 3. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 3 is 20. So, C = 20. That means there are 20 cows on the farm.

Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, that would be 2 * 20, which is 40. So, 40 chickens. Let me check that: 20 cows plus 40 chickens equals 60 animals. Yep, that adds up.

Now, the next part is figuring out the total number of legs. I know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, I need to calculate the total legs from the cows and the total legs from the chickens and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the legs from the cows. There are 20 cows, each with 4 legs. So, 20 * 4. Let me compute that. 20 times 4 is 80. So, cows contribute 80 legs.

Next, the chickens. There are 40 chickens, each with 2 legs. So, 40 * 2. That's 80. So, chickens contribute 80 legs as well.

Now, to find the total number of legs, I add the legs from cows and chickens together. So, 80 (from cows) + 80 (from chickens) equals 160 legs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Number of cows: 20. 20 cows * 4 legs = 80 legs. Number of chickens: 40. 40 chickens * 2 legs = 80 legs. 80 + 80 is 160. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it another way. Since all the animals are either chickens or cows, maybe I can calculate the total legs without separating them. But, that seems right. Let me see.

Each cow has 4 legs, each chicken has 2 legs. So, if I have 20 cows, that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs, and 40 chickens, that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs. So, 80 + 80 is 160. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of total legs per animal. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of legs as 2*(number of chickens) + 4*(number of cows). Since chickens are twice as many as cows, that would be 2*(2C) + 4*C = 4C + 4C = 8C. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 8C = 8*20=160. So, same answer.

So, that seems consistent. So, whether I calculate it by separating cows and chickens or by using the total number of animals, I get the same result.

So, the total number of legs is 160.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using ratios or something else.

So, the ratio of chickens to cows is 2:1. So, for every cow, there are two chickens. So, the total ratio is 3 parts
