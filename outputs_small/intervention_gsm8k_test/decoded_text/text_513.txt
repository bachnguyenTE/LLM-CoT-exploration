Q: Julie had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes and then 25% of the remaining money on CDs. How much money did Julie have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, and then 25% of what's left on CDs. I need to figure out how much she has left after these two expenses. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what 20% of $500 is. I think percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100, so 20% is 0.20. So, 20% of $500 would be 0.20 multiplied by 500. Let me calculate that. 0.20 times 500. Hmm, 0.2 times 500 is 100, and 0.2 times 50 is 10.10, so adding those together, 180. So, Julie spent $180 on clothes. 

Now, she had $500 initially, and she spent $180 on clothes. So, the remaining money after buying clothes would be 500 minus 180. Let me do that subtraction. 500 minus 180. 500 minus 100 is 440, and then minus 70 more is 370. So, she has $370 left after buying clothes.

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs. So, 25% of $370. Again, converting 25% to a decimal is 0.25. So, 0.25 times 370. Let me compute that. 0.2 times 370 is 74, and 0.05 times 370 is 185.5. Wait, that seems right. So, adding those together, 74 plus 185.5 is 259.5. So, she spends $259.50 on CDs.

Now, to find out how much she has left after buying the CDs, I need to subtract this amount from the remaining money after clothes. So, $370 minus $259.50. Let me do that subtraction. 370 minus 259.50. Hmm, 370 minus 250 is 120, and then minus 9.50 is 110.50. So, she has $110.500 left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with $500, 20% is 180, so 500 minus 180 is 320. Wait, that seems right.
