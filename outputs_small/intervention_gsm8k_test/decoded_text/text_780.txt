Q: Ava and Emma want to know who is better at the new video game Ava got for her birthday. They are each going to play one level and whoever has the highest score wins. They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, 5 points for each berry they collect, and 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level. If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes the level 4 seconds slower, what is the difference between their two scores?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the difference in points between Ava and Emma based on the given information.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and each enemy gives 10 points. So, the difference in points from jumping on enemies is 8 * 10 = 80 points.

Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, and each berry gives 5 points. Therefore, the difference in points from berries is 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Additionally, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, earning 30 points for the extra time. This gives an extra 30 points for Ava.

To find the total difference in their scores, I'll add up the points from jumping, collecting berries, and the extra time: 80 + 15 + 30 = 133 points.

So, Ava's score is 133 points higher than Emma's.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the difference in scores between Ava and Emma.

### **Given:**
- **Points for each enemy jumped on:** 10 points
- **Points for each berry collected:** 5 points
- **Points for extra time on the timer:** 30 points
- **Difference in enemies jumped on:** Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- **Difference in berries collected:** Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava.
- **Difference in time:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower.

### **Let's define variables:**
- Let **E** be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Then, **A** (Ava's enemies) = **E + 8**.
- Let **B** be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Then, **A** (Ava's berries) = **B + 3**.

### **Calculate the scores:**

1. **Emma's Score:**
   - **Enemies:** **E** enemies × 10 points = **10E** points
   - **Berries:** **B** berries × 5 points = **5B** points
   - **Extra Time:** 0 points (since Emma doesn't mention extra time)
   - **Total Score:** **10E + 5B**

2. **Ava's Score:**
   - **Enemies:** **(E + 8)** enemies × 10 points = **10E + 80** points
   - **Berries:** **(B + 3)** berries × 5 points = **5B + 15** points
   - **Extra Time:** 30 points (for 4 seconds)
   - **Total Score:** **10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30** = **10E + 5B + 125**

3. **Difference in Scores:**
   - **Ava's Score - Emma's Score** = (**10E + 5B + 125**) - (**10E + 5B**) = **-2E + 125**

### **Conclusion:**
The difference in their scores is **125 - 2E** points. However, since the exact number of enemies (E) isn't provided, we can't determine the exact numerical difference. If additional information is provided, we can substitute the value of E to find the precise difference.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{125 - 2E}
