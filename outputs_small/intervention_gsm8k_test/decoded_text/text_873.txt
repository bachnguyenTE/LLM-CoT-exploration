Q: David has $12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts from a bin at the hardware store. Each bolt costs $0.03. How much money does David have left after paying for the bolts?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so I'll multiply 16 by $0.03 to find the total expense.

Next, I'll subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David initially has, which is $12.48. This will give me the remaining money David has after making the purchase.

**Solution:**

David has \$12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts, each costing \$0.03.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bolts} \times \text{Cost per Bolt} = 16 \times \$0.03 = \$0.18
   \]

2. **Subtract the total cost from the initial amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \$12.48 - \$0.18 = \$12.30
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$12.30}
\]
