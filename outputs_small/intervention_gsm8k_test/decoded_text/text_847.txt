Q: Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that gives simple interest. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what simple interest is. From what I remember, simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount, not on the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

Where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case, Brenda invested $300, so that's our principal \( P = 300 \). The rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Wait, that seems right. So, the rate is 3/4 of the original amount. But, that seems right. Let me parse that again.

The rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the rate \( r \) is 3/4 times the principal. So, \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times P \). But, that seems right. So, if the principal is $300, then the rate is 3/4 of that, which is 3/4 * 300.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that.

First, let me write down the given values:

- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\( r \)) = 3/4 of the original amount per year. So, \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 \)
- Time (\(t\)) = 3 years

So, let me compute the rate first.

Calculating \( r \):

\( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 \)

Hmm, 3 divided by 4 is 0.75, so 0.75 multiplied by 300.

0.75 * 300 = ?

Well, 0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 of 300 is 225. Wait, that seems right. Because 300 divided by 4 is 75, and 75 times 3 is 225.

So, the rate \( r = 225 \) per year.

Wait, that seems right. So, the interest rate is 225% per annum? That's a pretty high rate, but, that seems right. Let me check.

Wait, that seems right. If the rate is three-quarters of the original amount, so 3/4 of 300 is 225. So, the rate is 225% per annum. That's a high rate, but, that seems right. So, moving on.

So, now, we can compute the interest.

Using the simple interest formula:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute 300 multiplied by 225.

300 * 225. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that.

I can break it down:

300 * 200 = 60,000

300 *25 = 7,500

So, adding those together: 60,000 + 7,500 = 67,500

So, 300 * 225 = 67,500

Wait, that seems right. 300 * 225 is 67,500.

Now, multiply that by 3:

67,500 * 3

Let me compute that.

67,500 * 3:

60,000 *3 = 180,000

7,500 *3 = 22,500

Adding those together: 180,000 + 22,500 = 202,500

So, the interest is $202,500.

Wait, that seems right. So, the interest earned over 3 years is $202,500.

But, that seems right. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, that seems right. 300 * 225 is 67,500, and 67
