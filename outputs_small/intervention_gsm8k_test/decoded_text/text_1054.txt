Q: My kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt. I want to install new square floor tiles that cost $12 each, and each tile side is 1ft in length. How much will it cost me to renovate my kitchen floor?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of square tiles required to cover the kitchen floor. The kitchen floor measures 200 square feet, and each tile covers 1 square foot. Therefore, I will need 200 tiles.

Next, I calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile. Each tile costs $12, so 220 tiles multiplied by $12 per tile equals $2,640.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   
   - **Total area of the kitchen floor:** 200 square feet (SqFt)
   - **Area of each square tile:** 1 square foot (since each side is 1 foot)
   
   \[
   \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of each tile}} = \frac{220 \,000 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt}} = 220 \text{ tiles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   - **Cost per tile:** \$12
   - **Total cost:** 
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 220 \times 12 = \$2,\!640
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$2,\!640}
\]
