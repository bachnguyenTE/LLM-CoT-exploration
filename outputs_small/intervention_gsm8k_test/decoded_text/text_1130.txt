Q: Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?

Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes when there are 16 ounces to a pound.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to group them into boxes, each containing 8 crayons. So, I think I need to figure out how many boxes he needs. That should be the total number of crayons divided by the number of crayons per box.

So, 220 divided by 8. Wait, that seems right. Let me calculate that. 220 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 goes into 22 two times (since 8*2=16), subtract 16 from 22, you get 6. Bring down the 2, making it 62. 8 goes into 62 seven times (8*7=56), subtract 56 from 62, you get 6. So, it's 27 with a remainder of 6. So, 220 divided by 8 is 27.5. Wait, that seems right. So, 27.5 boxes? But, that seems right. Because 27 boxes would hold 216 crayons, and 0.5 boxes would hold 4 crayons, since 0.5*8=4. So, yeah, 27.5 boxes.

But, that seems right. So, each box is 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 27.5 boxes multiplied by 8 ounces per box. Let me calculate that. 27.5*8. Hmm, 27*8 is 216, and 0.5*8 is 4, so total is 216+4=220 ounces. Wait, that seems right. So, the boxes weigh 2220 ounces.

Now, the crayons. Each crayon is 1 ounce, so 220 crayons would weigh 220 ounces. So, total weight is the weight of the boxes plus the weight of the crayons. So, 220 ounces (crayons) + 220 ounces (boxes) = 440 ounces.

But, that seems right. So, 440 ounces total. Now, we need to convert ounces to pounds. Since 16 ounces equal 1 pound, we can divide 440 by 16 to get the weight in pounds.

So, 440 divided by 16. Let me compute that. 16 goes into 440 how many times? 16*27=432, because 16*25=400, and 16*2=32, so 400+32=432. So, 16*27=432. Then, 440-432=8. So, 27 with a remainder of 8. So, 27 and 8/16, which simplifies to 27 and 4/3, which is 27.333... pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, 440 ounces is 27.333... pounds. But, that seems right. So, the total weight is 27 and 1/3 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, Nik has 220 crayons, each 1 ounce, so 220 ounces. He puts them into boxes, each box holding 8 crayons, so 220 divided by 8 is 27.5 boxes, each box is 8 ounces, so 27.5*8=220 ounces. So, the boxes weigh 220 ounces, the crayons weigh 220 ounces, so total is 440 ounces. 440 divided by 16 is 27.5 pounds. Wait, that seems right. So, 27.5 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 27.5 pounds. So, in box form, that's 27.5, which is 27 and a half pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, Nik's total weight is 27.5 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total weight is \boxed{27.5} pounds.
