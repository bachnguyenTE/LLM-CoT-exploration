Q: Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. Tuesday she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. How many cakes did she buy after all three days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Rose buying cakes over three days, and I need to figure out how many cakes she bought in total after all three days. Let me try to break this down step by step because it seems a bit confusing at first glance.

First, the problem says that on Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes. That seems straightforward. So, Monday: 4 cakes.

Then, on Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times the number of cakes she did on Monday. Hmm, okay. So, if she bought 4 cakes on Monday, then on Tuesday, she bought 3 times that. Let me write that down.

Monday: 4 cakes  
Tuesday: 3 × Monday's cakes = 3 × 4 = 12 cakes

Alright, so Tuesday she bought 12 cakes. That makes sense because 3 times 4 is 12.

Now, moving on Wednesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. So, let's calculate that.

Tuesday: 12 cakes  
Wednesday: 5 × Tuesday's cakes = 5 × 12 = 60 cakes

Wait, that seems right. 5 times 12 is 60? Let me double-check that. 12 times 5 is 60, right? Yeah, 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 is 60. Okay, so Wednesday she bought 60 cakes.

Now, the question is asking how many cakes she bought after all three days. So, I need to add up the cakes from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Monday: 4  
Tuesday: 12  
Wednesday: 60

Adding them together: 4 + 12 +60.

Let me do that step by step. 4 plus 12 is 16, and then 16 plus 60 is 76. So, the total number of cakes she bought over the three days is 76.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Monday: 4 cakes.  
Tuesday: 3 times Monday's amount, so 3×4=12. Wait, that seems right. 3×4 is 12? No, wait, that seems right. 3×4 is 12? No, 3×4 is 12? Wait, that seems right. 3×4 is 12? No, 3×4 is 12? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 3×4 is 12? No, 3×4 is 12? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 3×4 is 12. Yeah, that's correct.

Then, Wednesday: 5 times Tuesday's amount, which is 5×12=60. That's correct.

Adding them up: 4 +12 +60. Wait, that seems right. 4 +12 is 16, and 16 +60 is 76. So, 76 cakes in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 76 cakes.

But, that seems right. Let me just think again. On Monday, 4 cakes. Tuesday, 3 times that is 12. Wednesday, 5 times Tuesday's amount is 60. So, 4 +12 is 16, plus 60 is 76. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the total number of cakes she bought after all three days is 76.

**Final Answer**
The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \boxed{76}.

Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cakes. 

- Monday: 4 cakes  
- Tuesday: 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.  
- Wednesday: 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the cakes bought each day:

- Total cakes = 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76.

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\).
