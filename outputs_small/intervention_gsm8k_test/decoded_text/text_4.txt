Q: Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

Okay, so I have this problem about Wendi and her chickens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that every day, Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed. These feeds include seeds, mealworms, and vegetables. She gives them their feed in three separate meals throughout the day. 

Now, the question is asking how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. It also mentions that in the morning, she gives them 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. So, we need to find out how much she needs for the final meal.

Let me break this down. 

First, let's figure out the total amount of feed Wendi uses each day. She has 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed. So, the total feed per day is 20 multiplied by 3 cups. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 20 chickens times 3 cups each. Let me write that out: 20 * 3. Hmm, 20 times 3 is 60. So, she uses 60 cups of feed each day. 

But, that seems right. 20 chickens, each getting 3 cups, so 60 cups total. 

Now, she gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals throughout the day. So, each meal is a portion of the total feed. 

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. So, let me add those up. 15 cups in the morning plus 25 cups in the afternoon. 

15 + 25 is 40 cups. So, she's already given out 40 cups of feed by the end of the afternoon. 

Since the total daily feed is 60 cups, and she's used 40 cups by the end of the afternoon, the remaining feed for the final meal would be 60 - 40. 

60 - 40 is 20 cups. So, she needs 20 cups for the final meal. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 

Total feed per day: 20 chickens * 3 cups = 60 cups. Correct. 

Morning feed: 15 cups. Afternoon feed: 25 cups. Total given so far: 15 +25=40 cups. 

Remaining feed: 60 -40=20 cups. 

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final meal requires 20 cups of feed. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to first find the total daily feed, then subtract the feeds given in the morning and afternoon to find the remaining for the final meal. 

So, the answer should be 20 cups. 

**Final Answer**
The number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is \boxed{20}.

Wendi feeds her 20 chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed each day. The total feed required per day is calculated as follows:

\[
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Wendi gives her chickens feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[
15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed:

\[
60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is \boxed{20}.
