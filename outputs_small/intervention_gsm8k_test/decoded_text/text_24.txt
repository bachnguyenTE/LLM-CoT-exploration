Q: Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50. This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?

Okay, so Kyle bought a book last year, and it was one of the best-selling ones. Now, he's seeing it for $19.50, and that's after a 25% discount from the original price. Hmm, I need to figure out what the original price was before the discount. 

Alright, let me think about this. If the book is on sale for 25% off, that means Kyle is paying 75% of the original price, right? Because 100% minus 25% is 75%. So, $19.50 is 75% of the original price. I guess I can set up an equation to solve for the original price.

Let me denote the original price as "P." So, 75% of P is equal to $19.50. In mathematical terms, that would be 0.75 * P = 19.50. To find P, I need to divide both sides by 0.75. So, P = 19.50 / 0.75. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me do the division. 19.50 divided by 0.75. Hmm, maybe I can convert these decimals into fractions to make it easier. 0.75 is the same as 3/4, and 19.50 is the same as 19.5. So, 19.5 divided by (3/4) is the same as 19.5 multiplied by (4/3). 

Let me compute that. 19.5 times 4 is... 19 times 4 is 76, and 0.5 times 4 is 2, so that's 78. Then, 78 divided by 3 is 26. So, P is $26.00. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my math again. If the original price was $26, and there's a 25% discount, then 25% of 26 is... 0.25 * 26 = 6.5. So, subtracting that from 26 gives 26 - 6.5 = 19.5, which matches the price Kyle paid. So, that checks out. 

Alternatively, I can think about it another way. If 25% off means you're paying 75% of the original price, then 75% is $19.50. Wait, that seems right. So, 75% of P is $19.50. So, 0.75P = 19.50. So, P = 19.50 / 0.75. Which is the same as 19.50 divided by 0.75. 

Let me do that division step by step. 0.75 goes into 19.50 how many times? Well, 0.75 times 20 is 15.00, which is less than 19.50. 0.75 times 26 is 19.50, because 0.75*20=15, 0.75*6=4.5, so 15+4.5=19.5. So, 0.75*26=19.50. So, P is 26.00. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the original price was $26.00. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. 

Another way to think about it is to reverse the discount. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price, then 100% would be higher. So, 75% is $19.50, so 1% is $19.50 divided by 75. Let me compute that. 19.50 / 75. Hmm, 75 goes into 19.50... 75 goes into 195 (after moving the decimal) 2 times because 75*2=150, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 75*2=150, which is less than 195. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that
