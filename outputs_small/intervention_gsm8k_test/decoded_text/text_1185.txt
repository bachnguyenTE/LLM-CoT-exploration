Q: The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.  If Kate’s 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, how many pizza pies does she need to buy?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Kate and her pizza. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and a pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Kate has 6 friends, and each of them eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. The question is asking how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, I need to calculate the total number of slices each type of pizza will be consumed and then figure out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

Let me break it down. There are two types of pizzas: cheese and pepperoni. Each type is cut into a certain number of slices. For cheese pizza, it's 12 slices, and for pepperoni, it's 8 slices. 

Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni. So, first, I should calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices needed and the total number of pepperoni pizza slices needed.

Starting with the cheese pizza: each friend eats 6 slices, and there are 6 friends. So, the total cheese slices needed would be 6 friends multiplied by 6 slices per friend. Let me write that down:

Total cheese slices = 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices.

Wait, that seems right. 6 times 6 is 36. So, 36 slices of cheese pizza are needed in total.

Now, moving on to the pepperoni pizza. Each friend eats 4 slices, and there are 6 friends. So, the total pepperoni slices needed would be 6 friends multiplied by 4 slices per friend.

Total pepperoni slices = 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices.

Okay, so Kate needs 36 slices of cheese pizza and 24 slices of pepperoni pizza. Now, each type of pizza is cut into a certain number of slices. Cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, and pepperoni into 8 slices. So, I need to figure out how many whole pizzas are needed for each type.

Starting with the cheese pizza. Each pizza has 12 slices, so to find out how many pizzas are needed, I can divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza. 

Number of cheese pizzas needed = Total cheese slices / Slices per cheese pizza = 36 / 12.

Wait, that seems right. 36 divided by 2 is 18. So, 18 cheese pizzas are needed.

But, that seems right. 18 pizzas would give 18*12=36 slices, which is exactly what we need. So, 18 cheese pizzas.

Now, moving on to the pepperoni pizza. Each pizza has 8 slices, so we need to divide the total pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza.

Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total pepperoni slices / Slices per pepperoni pizza = 24 / 8.

Hmm, 24 divided by 8 is 3. So, 3 pepperoni pizzas are needed.

Wait, that seems right. 3 pizzas would give 3*8=24 slices, which is exactly what we need. So, 3 pepperoni pizzas.

So, in total, Kate needs 18 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
