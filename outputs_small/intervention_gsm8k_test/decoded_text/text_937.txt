Q: Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 15 goats and 12 sheep, how many pounds of hay does Nate need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Nate feeding his livestock hay. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. That seems straightforward. Then, it mentions that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate the hay required for each sheep based on that.

Let me break it down. Each goat needs 5 pounds. So, if there are 15 goats, the total hay for goats would be 15 times 5 pounds. Let me write that down: 15 goats * 5 pounds per goat. That should give me the total for the goats.

Now, moving on to the sheep. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, first, I need to find twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that would be 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. Then, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than that. So, 10 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. Okay, so each sheep needs 7 pounds.

There are 12 sheep, so the total hay for sheep would be 12 * 7 pounds. Let me calculate that. 12 * 7 is 84. So, 84 pounds for the sheep.

Now, to find the total hay needed, I need to add the hay for goats and the hay for sheep together. So, goats are 15 goats * 5 pounds each, which is 25 pounds. Sheep are 12 sheep * 7 pounds each, which is 84 pounds. So, total hay is 25 + 84.

Let me add those together. 25 + 84 is 109. So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is 109 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. For goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds = 75 pounds. For sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds = 84 pounds. Adding them together: 75 + 84. Hmm, 75 + 80 is 155, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 75 + 84 is 159. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 goats need 75 pounds, 12 sheep need 84 pounds, so total is 159 pounds. So, the answer is 159 pounds.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each goat is 5, so 15*5 is 75. Each sheep is 2*5=10, minus 3 is 7. 12*7 is 84. 75+84 is 159. Yeah, that's correct.

I think that's the answer. So, the total hay needed is 159 pounds.

**Final Answer**
Nate needs \boxed{159} pounds of hay.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for goats is calculated as follows:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds per goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Twice the amount each goat needs is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Subtracting 3 pounds from this amount gives:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds per sheep} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for sheep is:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds per sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for goats and sheep together gives:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\]
