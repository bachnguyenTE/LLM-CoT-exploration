Q: 100 people apply for a job at Google. Of the people that apply, only 30% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about 100 people applying for a job at Google. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many people end up accepting the position. Hmm, let's see.

First, it says 30% of the applicants receive interviews. So, if there are 100 people applying, 30% of 100 should be the number of people who get interviews. Let me calculate that. 30% of 100 is 0.3 times 100, which is 33. So, 33 people get interviews.

Alright, next part: Of those who receive interviews, 20% get a job offer. So, 20% of 33 people. Let me compute that. 0.2 times 33 is... 6.6. Wait, that seems right. So, 6.6 people get a job offer. Hmm, but, that seems right. Maybe I should keep it as a fraction or something? Wait, that seems right. 20% is 0.2, so 0.2 times 33 is 6.6. So, 6.6 people get a job offer. Hmm, but, that seems right. Maybe I can just keep it as a decimal for now.

Then, of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. So, a third of 6.6 people. Let me calculate that. 1/3 of 6.6 is approximately 2.2. So, about 2.2 people accept the position. Hmm, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 2.2 people accept the position.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, that seems right. Hmm, that seems right.
