Q: A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?

Okay, so I have this problem about Octavia and Juan drinking coffee. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that a stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Hmm, I think "stickler" here means someone who is very particular about their health, so maybe they have a strict diet or something. Anyway, the key point is that Octavia drinks half the daily recommendation. 

Then it says Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. But, that seems right. So, Juan is currently drinking more than that, and he needs to cut down. The question is, by how many cups must he reduce his daily intake?

Alright, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how much coffee Octavia drinks. The problem doesn't specify the daily recommendation, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe the daily recommendation is a standard amount, like 4 cups? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
