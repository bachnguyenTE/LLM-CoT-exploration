Q: The expenditure of Joseph in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less. How much was his total expenditure for those two months?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine Joseph's expenditure in June. Since his expenditure in May was $500 and it was $60 less in June, I subtract $60 from $500 to find out how much he spent in June.

Next, I'll add the expenditure from May and June together to find the total expenditure over the two months.

**Solution:**

Let's determine Joseph's total expenditure for May and June.

1. **Expenditure in May:**
   \[
   \text{Expenditure in May} = \$500
   \]

2. **Expenditure in June:**
   \[
   \text{Expenditure in June} = \$500 - \$60 = \$434
   \]

3. **Total Expenditure for Two Months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenditure} = \$500 + \$434 = \boxed{\$934}
   \]
