Q: The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?

Okay, so I have this problem about Phineas Frog who needs to return home after being flooded. He has to hop on land and swim through water. The total distance he needs to cover is 200 yards, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, half the distance is on land, and the other half is in water. So, 200 yards total, meaning 110 yards on land and 110 yards in water. Hmm, okay.

He hops on land at 20 yards per minute and swims through water at 10 yards per minute. The question is asking how long it will take him to return home. So, I need to calculate the time he spends on land and the time he spends swimming, then add them together.

Let me break it down. First, the distance on land is 110 yards, and the distance in water is also 110 yards. So, he's going to hop 110 yards and swim 110 yards. 

Now, time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, for the land part, the time should be 110 yards divided by 20 yards per minute. Similarly, for the water part, it's 111 yards divided by 10 yards per minute.

Let me write that down:

Time on land = 110 / 20

Time swimming = 111 / 10

Then, total time = Time on land + Time swimming.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 110 divided by 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 110 how many times? 20 times 5 is 100, so that's 5 minutes, with a remainder of 11 yards. So, 110 /20 is 5.5 minutes. Wait, that seems right. 20 times 5.5 is 110, so yes, 5.5 minutes.

Next, 111 divided by 10. That's straightforward. 10 goes into 111 eleven times with a remainder of 1, so that's 11.1 minutes.

So, adding those two times together: 5.5 + 11.1. Let me add them. 5 + 11 is 16, and 0.5 + 0.1 is 0.6, so total is 16.6 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16.6 minutes in total.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, 110 divided by 20. Wait, that seems right. 110 divided by 20 is 5.5. 111 divided by 10 is 11.1. So, 5.5 + 11.1 is 16.6. So, 16.6 minutes.

But, that seems right. So, 16.6 minutes is the total time.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16.6 minutes is 16 minutes and 36 seconds, but, that seems right. So, the answer is 16.6 minutes.

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, 16.6 minutes is the total time.
