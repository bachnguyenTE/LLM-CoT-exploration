Q: Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?

Okay, so Audrey has to take two math tests to move onto the 7th grade. She needs to get 70% of all the questions right in total. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% right. The second test has 40 questions, and we need to figure out how many she needs to get right on that to meet the overall 70% requirement.

First, let me break this down. She has two tests, so the total number of questions she'll have taken is 70 plus 40, which is 110 questions. To move on to 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of all these questions right. So, I should calculate 70% of 110 to find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in total.

Let me write that out: 70% of 110. To calculate percentages, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 70% is 0.70 in decimal form. Then, 0.70 multiplied by 110. Let me do that multiplication. 0.70 times 100 is 77, and 0.70 times 1 is 0.70, so adding those together gives 77.7. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 70% of 110 is 81.7?
