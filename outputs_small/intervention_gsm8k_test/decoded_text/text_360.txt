Q: Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Carver just turned 45 years old, and that makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. I need to figure out how old his son is. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the information. Carver is 45 years old. His age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if I let the son's age be some variable, say S, then twice his age would be 2S. Then, subtracting 5 years from that gives me Carver's age, which is 45. So, putting that into an equation, it would be:

2S - 5 = 45

Is that right? Let me make sure. If the son is S years old, twice that is 2S. Then, 5 years less than that would be 2S - 5. And that equals Carver's age, which is 45. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, now I have the equation:

2S - 5 = 45

I need to solve for S. Let me do that step by step. First, I can add 5 to both sides to get rid of the -5 on the left side. So, adding 5 to both sides:

2S -5 +5 = 45 +5

Simplifying that, the left side becomes 2S, and the right side becomes 50. So now I have:

2S = 50

Now, to solve for S, I need to divide both sides by 2. So, dividing both sides by 2:

2S / 2 = 50 / 2

Simplifying that, the left side is S, and the right side is 25. So, S = 25.

Wait, that seems right. So, the son is 25 years old. Let me double-check that.

If the son is 25, then twice his age is 50. Then, subtracting 5 years gives 45, which is Carver's age. That matches the problem statement. So, yes, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Sometimes, when setting up equations, it's easy to make a mistake in the initial setup. So, let me go through it again.

Carver is 45. His age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, twice the son's age is 2S, and 5 years less is 2S -5. So, 2S -5 = 45. That's correct.

Solving for S:

2S -5 = 45

Add 5 to both sides:

2S = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

S = 25

Yes, that's consistent. So, the son is 25 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think about it another way. If the son is 25, then twice his age is 50. 50 minus 5 is 45, which is Carver's age. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of equations, maybe I can represent it differently. Let me denote Carver's age as C and the son's age as S.

Given that C = 45, and C = 2S -5.

So, substituting C with 45:

45 = 2S -5

Which is the same equation as before. So, solving for S:

45 +5 = 2S

50 = 2S

25 = S

Same result. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of age differences or something else, but, that seems right. I don't think there's another way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. So, the son is 25 years old. So, the answer is 25.

But, that seems right. Let me think about it in another way. If the son is 25, then twice his age is 50. 50 minus 5 is 45, which is Carver's age. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of equations, maybe I can represent it as:

Carver's age = 2*(son's age) -5

So, 45 = 2S -5

Which is the same as before.

So, solving for S:

2S = 45 +5 =50

S =55 /2 =27.5

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
