Q: A crocodile grows 8 inches long in 4 years. At this rate, how many inches will it grow in 13 years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a crocodile growing inches over time, and I need to figure out how many inches it will grow in 13 years. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Hmm, so I guess I need to find out how much it grows each year and then multiply that by 13 years. That makes sense because if I know the annual growth rate, I can scale it up to any number of years.

Alright, so if it grows 8 inches in 4 years, I can find the annual growth rate by dividing 8 by 4. Let me write that down:

8 inches ÷ 4 years = 2 inches per year.

Wait, that seems right. So the crocodile grows 2 inches every year. Now, to find out how much it grows in 13 years, I just need to multiply the annual growth rate by 13. Let me do that:

2 inches/year × 13 years = 26 inches.

Hmm, so that would mean the crocodile grows 26 inches in 13 years. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with 8 inches over 4 years: 8 divided by 4 is indeed 2. So that's correct. Then, multiplying 2 by 13: 2 times 10 is 20, and 2 times 3 is 6, so 22 plus 6 is 28? Wait, that seems right.
