Q: Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. How many birds does he count in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many birds Jerry counts in total. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes, 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead, and 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. How many birds does he count in total?"

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. That seems straightforward. So, that's 6 birds.

Next, it says 2/3rd of that number of birds flying overhead. Hmm, so that means out of the six birds nesting, 2/3rd are flying somewhere else. I need to calculate how many that is. Let me write that down.

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * number of birds nesting.

So, substituting the number of birds nesting, which is 6:

Number of birds flying overhead = (2/3) * 6.

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.6666..., but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2/3 of 6 is 4. Because 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 2 times 2 is 4. So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Okay, so now we have 6 birds nesting and 4 birds flying overhead. So, so far, that's 6 + 4 = 10 birds. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 6 + 4 is 10. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 10 birds accounted for so far.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2/3 of 6 is 4, so 6 + 4 is 10. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the next part is 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. So, that means there are 3 groups, each containing 8 birds. So, how many is that?

Number of birds feeding = 3 * 8.

Let me compute that. 3 times 8 is 24. So, 24 birds are feeding.

So, now, we have 10 birds accounted for (6 nesting, 4 flying overhead) and 24 birds feeding. So, to find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to add all these together.

Total birds = 10 + 24.

10 +24 is 14. So, 14 birds in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, 6 birds nesting, 2/3 of that is 4 flying overhead, and 3 groups of 8 feeding. So, 6 +4 is 10, and 3*8 is 24, so 10 +24 is 14. So, 14 birds in total.

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
