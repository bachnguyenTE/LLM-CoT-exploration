Q: Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Carlos and Benji are at the beach, and they each rent a different watercraft. Carlos is renting a canoe for $30 an hour, and Benji is renting a banana boat for $18 an hour. They each use their respective rentals for a certain number of hours, and I need to figure out how much they'll pay altogether for their rentals. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Carlos is renting a canoe, which costs $30 per hour. Wait, that seems right. So, $30 is the hourly rate for the canoe. Then, Benji is renting a banana boat, which costs $18 per hour. He uses it for 5 hours. Carlos uses his canoe for 3 hours. I need to calculate the total amount they'll pay together.

Alright, so I think the way to approach this is to calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together. That makes sense because each person is paying for their own rental, so their costs are separate. So, let's start with Carlos.

Carlos is renting a canoe for 3 hours. The cost per hour is $30. Wait, that seems right. So, for each hour he uses it, he has to pay $30. So, for 3 hours, that would be 3 multiplied by $30. Let me write that down.

Carlos's cost = 3 hours * $30/hour.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 times 30. Let me compute that. 3 times 30 is 90. So, Carlos will pay $90 for his canoe rental.

Now, moving on to Benji. He's renting a banana boat for 5 hours, and the hourly rate is $18. So, similar to Carlos, I need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he uses it.

Benji's cost = 5 hours * $18/hour.

Let me calculate that. 5 times 18 is 40. So, Benji will pay $40 for his banana boat rental.

Now, to find the total amount they'll pay altogether, I need to add Carlos's cost and Benji's cost together.

Total cost = Carlos's cost + Benji's cost.

So, that would be $90 + $40.

Wait, that seems right. Let me add those together. 90 plus 40 is 130. So, altogether, they will pay $130 for their rentals.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Carlos: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90. That seems correct.

Benji: 5 hours * $18/hour = $40. That also seems correct.

Adding them together: $90 + $40 = $130. Yep, that adds up.

Hmm, is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, uses it for 3 hours. Benji rents a banana boat for $18 an hour, uses it for 5 hours. So, yeah, the calculations seem correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in another way to verify. Let's see, if I break down the costs:

For Carlos: 3 hours * $30/hour. So, 3 * 30. 3*3 is 9, so 90. That's correct.

For Benji: 5 hours * $18/hour. 5*18. 5*10 is 50, 5*8 is 40, so 50 + 40 is 90? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 5*18 is 90. So, 90.

Wait, that seems right. So, 90 + 90 is 180? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
