Q: Rani is obsessed with sports cars. She wonders what the faster car ever made can go so she looks it up. What she finds out is that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 Miles per hour. How fast does the faster car go?

Okay, so Rani is obsessed with sports cars, and she's trying to figure out how fast the fastest car can go. She found out that this fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the speed of the second fastest car first, and then multiply that by 1.25 to get the speed of the fastest car. 

Let me break it down step by step. The problem says the second fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour. So, if the second car is 5 times faster than the average, that means I need to multiply 120 by 5 to get its speed.

Let me write that down: 120 mph * 5. Hmm, 120 times 5. Let me calculate that. 100 times 5 is 500, and 20 times 5 is 100, so adding those together, 500 + 100 is 6100. Wait, that seems right. So the second fastest car goes 610 miles per hour. 

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than this second car. So, I need to find 1.25 times the speed of the second car. That would be 610 mph * 1.25. Hmm, okay, let me compute that. 

First, I can think of 1.25 as 5/4, so maybe it's easier to multiply 610 by 5 and then divide by 4. Let me try that. 610 * 5. 600 *5 is 3000, and 10*5 is 50, so 3000 +50 is 3050. Then, divide that by 4. 3050 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 4 goes into 30 seven times (28), remainder 2. Bring down the 5, making it 25. 4 goes into 25 six times (24), remainder 1. Bring down the 0, making it 10. 4 goes into 10 two times (8), remainder 2. So, 3050 divided by 4 is 762.5. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 610 *1.25 is 762.5 mph. So, the fastest car goes 762.5 miles per hour. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, average car is 120 mph. Second car is 5 times that, so 120*5=610. Then, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second car, so 610*1.25. 

Alternatively, 1.25 is the same as 5/4, so 610*(5/4). Let me compute 610 divided by 4 first. 610 divided by 4 is 152.5. Then, 152.5 multiplied by 5 is 762.5. Yep, same result. So, that seems consistent.

So, the fastest car goes 762.5 miles per hour. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions. 1.25 is 5/4, so 610*(5/4). 610 divided by 4 is 152.5, and 152.5 multiplied by 5 is 762.5. Yep, same answer. So, I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the answer should be 762.5 mph.

**Final Answer**
The faster car goes \boxed{762.5} miles per hour.

Rani is trying to figure out how fast the fastest sports car can go. She found out that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, and the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[
120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 610 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we calculate the speed of the fastest car, which is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car:
\[
61
