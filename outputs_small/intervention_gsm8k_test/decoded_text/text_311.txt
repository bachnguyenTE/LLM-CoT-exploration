Q: In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a family of 5, and I need to figure out how many eggs they consume in a week. Let me read it again: "In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?" Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, the family has 5 people. Out of these, three people eat 3 eggs each day. That means the remaining people must be eating fewer eggs. Since there are 5 people in total, subtracting the 3 who eat 3 eggs each day, that leaves 2 people. So, these two people eat 2 eggs each day. Got that.

Now, I need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day and then multiply that by 7 to get the weekly consumption. Let me write this out.

For the three people: Each of them eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total eggs consumed by them per day would be 3 people multiplied by 3 eggs each. That's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs per day.

For the remaining two people: Each of them eats 2 eggs a day. So, the total eggs consumed by them per day would be 2 people multiplied by 2 eggs each. That's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Now, to find the total daily consumption for the whole family, I need to add the eggs consumed by the first group and the second group. So, 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 3 people eating 3 eggs each is 9, and 2 people eating 2 eggs each is 4. 9 + 4 is indeed 13. Okay, so 13 eggs per day.

Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, I need to multiply the daily consumption by 7 days. So, 13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs in a week.

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify: 13 eggs per day times 7 days. 13 * 7 is 91. Yes, that's correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe adding the eggs consumed by each person individually over a week.

So, the three people eat 3 eggs each day. Over a week, that's 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs for the first group.

The two people eat 2 eggs each day. Over a week, that's 2 eggs/day * 7 days = 14 eggs for the second group.

Adding those together: 21 + 14 = 35 eggs in a week.

Wait, that seems right. So, 35 eggs in a week. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 35 eggs is the total.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 35 eggs in a week.

Wait, that seems right. So, both methods give me 13 eggs per day, which is 91 eggs in a week, or 21 + 14 = 35 eggs in a week. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
