Q: Colby works for a manufacturing company in the packaging division.  He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, how much money, in dollars, does he earn in a typical eight-hour workday?

Okay, so Colby works for a manufacturing company, specifically in the packaging division. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. The question is asking how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday if he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how many packages Colby completes per hour. The problem says he completes 10 less than 55 packages. Wait, that seems right. So, 55 minus 10. Let me write that down: 55 - 10. Hmm, 55 minus 10 is 45, so he completes 45 packages per hour. Is that correct? Yeah, 55 minus 10 is 45. Okay, so he does 45 packages each hour.

Now, he gets paid $0.20 for each package. So, I need to calculate his earnings per hour. That would be the number of packages he completes multiplied by the payment per package. So, 45 packages times $0.20 per package. Let me compute that. 45 times 0.20. Hmm, 45 times 0.2 is 9, right? Because 45 times 0 is 45, and 45 times 0.2 is 9. So, 45 times 0.20 is 9. So, he earns $9 per hour.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 45 packages times $0.20 per package. 45 times 0.2 is 9, so yes, $9 per hour. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, he works an eight-hour day. So, to find his total earnings for the day, I need to multiply his hourly rate by 8. So, $9 per hour times 8 hours. Let me calculate that. 9 times 8 is 72. So, he earns $72 in a typical eight-hour workday.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. He completes 55 minus 10, which is 45 packages per hour. Each package is $0.20, so 45 times 0.20 is 9 dollars per hour. Then, 9 times 8 is 72. So, yes, $72. That seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions or something else? Hmm, 0.20 is the same as 1/5, right? So, 45 times 1/5 is 9. Yeah, that's the same as before. So, 9 times 8 is 72. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 45 packages per hour times $0.20 per package. So, 45 times 0.20. 45 times 0.2 is 9, so that's 9 dollars per hour. Then, 9 times 8 is 72. So, same answer.

Is there a chance I misread the problem? Let me check again. He gets paid $0.20 for every package. He completes 10 less than 50 per hour. So, 50 minus 10 is 40? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
