Q: A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.  An app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon if you fill up at this station.  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the cashback rewards?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at the local gas station, which is priced at $3.00 per gallon.

Next, I'll calculate the total cashback by multiplying the total gallons by the cashback rate of 0.20.

Finally, I'll subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find out how much the person will effectively pay after using the cashback rewards.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at the gas station:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00
   \]

2. **Determine the total cashback received:**
   
   \[
   \text{Cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.000
   \]

3. **Subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the effective amount paid:**
   
   \[
   \text{Effective Payment} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$27.90
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$27.90}
\]
