Q: Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. How much was the total cost?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Toula spent at the bakery. She bought different types of pastries, and I have to calculate the total cost. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out what she bought:

1. Donuts: She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68.
2. Mini cupcakes: She bought 2 dozen, each costing $80.
3. Mini cheesecakes: She bought 6 dozen, each costing $55.

Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, for each type, I need to multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen to get the total cost for that item. Then, I can add all those amounts together to get the total cost.

Let me start with the donuts. She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen is $68. So, the total cost for donuts would be 3 multiplied by 68. Let me write that down:

Donuts: 3 * $68

Hmm, 3 times 68. Let me calculate that. 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 8 is 24, so 180 + 24 is 204. So, donuts cost $228.

Okay, moving on to the mini cupcakes. She bought 2 dozen, each costing $80. So, that's 2 multiplied by 80.

Wait, that seems right. 2 times 80 is 160. So, cupcakes cost $160.

Now, the mini cheesecakes. She bought 6 dozen, each costing $55. So, that's 6 multiplied by 55.

6 times 55 is 300. So, cheesecakes cost $300.

Now, to find the total cost, I need to add up the costs of donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes.

So, that's $228 (donuts) + $160 (cupcakes) + $300 (cheesecakes).

Let me add them step by step.

First, add the donuts and cupcakes: 228 + 160.

228 + 160: 200 + 100 is 300, 28 + 60 is 88, so 300 + 88 is 388. Wait, that seems right. 228 + 160 is 388.

Then, add the cheesecakes: 388 + 300.

388 + 300 is 688. So, the total cost is $688.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Donuts: 3 * 68. 3*60 is 180, 3*8 is 24, so 180 +24 is 204. Wait, that seems right. 3*68 is 204.

Wait, that seems right. 68*3: 60*3=180, 8*3=24, 180+24=204. So, donuts are $204.

Wait, that seems right. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was $228. So, that was a miscalculation.

So, cupcakes: 2*80 is 160. That's correct.

Cheesecakes: 6*55. 6*50 is 300, 6*5 is 30, so 300 +30 is 330. Wait, that seems right. 6*55 is 330.

Wait, that seems right. So, 330.

So, donuts: 204, cupcakes:160, cheesecakes:330.

Wait, that seems right. So, 204 +160 is 364, plus 330 is 694.

Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
