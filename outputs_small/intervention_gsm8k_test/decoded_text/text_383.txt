Q: Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Okay, so Millie is opening a lemonade stand and wants to figure out her profit per hour. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand all the costs and revenues involved.

She spends $18 to buy enough supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, let me calculate the total number of cups she can make. If one pitcher is 12 cups, then 3 pitchers would be 3 times 12, which is 36 cups. Wait, that seems right. 12 times 3 is 36 cups. So, she can make 36 cups of lemonade.

Now, she sells each cup for $1. So, if she makes 36 cups, how much money does she make in total? Well, each cup is $1, so 36 cups times $1 per cup would be $36. So, she makes $36 in total from selling all the lemonade.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 36 cups times $1 is $36. Okay, so her total revenue is $36.

Now, she spends $18 to buy the supplies. So, her total cost is $18. So, her profit would be total revenue minus total cost. That would be $36 minus $18, which is $18. So, she makes a $18 profit if she sells all the lemonade.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if she sells all 36 cups, she makes $36, subtracts her $18 cost, and gets $18 profit. So, that's the total profit.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if she sells all the lemonade, her profit is $18 per hour? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
