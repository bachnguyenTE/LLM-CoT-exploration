Q: Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles.  How many miles did Sam run this week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many days Sam ran on the week. The problem states that Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is three days. Additionally, Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday, making a total of five days.

Next, I'll calculate the total miles Sam ran on the days he ran. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, 3 days multiplied by 3 miles per day equals 9 miles.

Then, on Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Therefore, 2 days multiplied by 5 miles per day equals 10 miles.

Finally, I'll add the miles from both sets of days together to find the total miles Sam ran this week. 9 miles plus 10 miles equals 29 miles.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many miles Sam ran this week.

**Given:**
- **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:** Sam ran **3 miles** each day.
- **Tuesday and Thursday:** Sam ran **5 miles** each day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total miles for the days Sam ran 3 miles.**

\[
\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} + \text{Miles on Friday} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total miles for the days Sam ran 5 miles.**

\[
\text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Thursday} = 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 3: Add the totals from both sets of days to find the overall total miles.**

\[
\text{Total miles} = 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 29 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{29}
\]
