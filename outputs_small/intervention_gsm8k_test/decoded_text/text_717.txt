Q: A pencil cost $0.50, and an eraser cost $0.25. If you bought 6 pencils and 8 erasers and paid $10, how much change would you get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

Each pencil costs $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils. So, the total cost for the pencils is 6 multiplied by $0.50, which equals $3.00.

Each eraser costs $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers. Therefore, the total cost for the erasers is 8 multiplied by $0.25, which equals $2.00.

Adding the total costs of the pencils and erasers together gives the overall amount spent: $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00.

Since you paid $10, the change you would receive is the difference between the amount paid and the total cost: $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the pencils:**
   
   - **Number of pencils:** 6
   - **Cost per pencil:** \$0.50
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pencils} = 6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the erasers:**
   
   - **Number of erasers:** 8
   - **Cost per eraser:** \$0.25
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for erasers} = 8 \times \$0.25 = \$2.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the change received:**
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$5.00}
\]
