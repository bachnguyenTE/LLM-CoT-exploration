Q: Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes while each plant of eggplant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Ricardo has a garden where he grows tomatoes and eggplants. I need to figure out how many fruits he can get from his plants. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the information given. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. He has 5 tomato plants. So, to find out how many tomatoes he gets, I should multiply the number of tomato plants by the yield per plant. That makes sense because if each plant gives 22 tomatoes, then 5 plants would give 5 times 22.

Let me write that down: 5 tomato plants * 22 tomatoes per plant. Hmm, 5 times 22. Let me calculate that. 5 times 20 is 110, right? So, 5 * 22 = 110. So, Ricardo gets 110 tomatoes from his tomato plants.

Now, moving on to eggplants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. He has 8 eggplant plants. So, similar to the tomatoes, I need to multiply the number of eggplant plants by the yield per plant. That would be 8 eggplant plants * 4 eggplants per plant.

Calculating that: 8 * 4. Well, 8 times 4 is 32. So, Ricardo gets 32 eggplants from his eggplant plants.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, I need to add the number of tomatoes and the number of eggplants together. So, 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants.

Let me add those numbers. 110 + 32. Hmm, 110 + 30 is 140, and then +2 is 142. So, 110 + 32 equals 142.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the tomatoes: 5 plants * 22 tomatoes per plant. 5*20 is 100, and 5*2 is 10, so 100 +10 is 110. That's correct.

Eggplants: 8 plants *4 eggplants per plant. 8*4 is 32. That's correct.

Adding them together: 110 +32. 110 +30 is 140, plus 2 is 142. Yep, that's correct.

So, Ricardo can get a total of 142 fruits from his plants.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using multiplication and addition in a different order? Let's see.

Alternatively, I could add the number of plants first and then multiply by the yield, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
