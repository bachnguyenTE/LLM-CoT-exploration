Q: Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. How much does she have to pay per month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to calculate the total interest Karan will pay over the five months. The principal amount is $3,650, and the interest rate is 10%. 

Next, I'll determine the total amount to be repaid by adding the principal and the interest.

Finally, I'll divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much Karan needs to pay each month.

**Solution:**

We need to determine the equal monthly payment Karan has to make to cover both the principal and the interest over five months.

1. **Calculate the Total Interest:**
   
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \$3,650 \times 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \$3,650 \times 0.01 \times 0.41667 \approx \$152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = \$3,650 + \$152.08 = \$3,802.08
   \]

3. **Determine the Equal Monthly Payment:**
   
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{\$3,802.08}{5} \approx \$760.42
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$760.42}
\]
