Okay, so Jen is going to three different countries, and he needs to pay $400 in supplies. Hmm, that's straightforward. Now, the question is about the travel cost, which is 50% more than the supplies. Wait, that seems right. So, I need to figure out what 50% more than $400 is. Let me think about how to calculate that.

First, I know that 50% is the same as 0.55 in decimal form. So, to find 55% of $400, I can multiply 400 by 0.55. Let me write that down: 400 * 0.55. Hmm, let me do the multiplication step by step.

Breaking it down, 400 times 0.5 is 220, because 400 divided by 2 is 220. Then, 400 times 0.05 is another 220. So, adding those together, 220 + 220 equals 440. So, 400 multiplied by 0.55 is 440. Therefore, the travel cost is $440.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If the supplies are $400, and the travel cost is 50% more, then 50% of 400 is 220, so adding that to 400 gives 440. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the total travel cost is $440.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be $440.

The travel cost is 55% more than the $400 in supplies. 

First, calculate 55% of $400:
\[
0.55 \times 400 = 220
\]

Then, add this to the original amount:
\[
400 + 220 = 620
\]

Wait, that seems right. So, the total travel cost is $620.

**Answer:** The travel cost is \boxed{620} dollars.
