Q: Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. If Robert has 20 cars, how many cars does joe remain with after selling and giving some to his mother?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Joe and Robert with their cars. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, the problem says: "Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. He sells 20% of them and gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. If Robert has 20 cars, how many cars does Joe remain with after selling and giving some to his mother?"

Alright, let's break this down. I think the key here is to figure out how many cars Joe has initially, then figure out how many he sells and gives away, and finally subtract those from his initial amount to find out how many he has left.

Starting with Robert. The problem says Robert has 20 cars. That seems straightforward. So, Robert: 20 cars.

Now, Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. So, if Robert has 20, Joe must have 2 times that. Let me write that down:

Joe's initial cars = 2 * Robert's cars = 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

So, Joe starts with 40 cars. Got that.

Next, the problem says Joe sells 20% of them. Hmm, okay, so he sells 20% of his cars. Let me calculate how many that is.

20% of 40 cars. To find 20% of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, 20% is 0.20 in decimal form. So, 0.20 * 40 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.20 * 40. Well, 0.2 * 40 is the same as 20% of 40. Let me do 40 divided by 5, because 20% is 1/5. So, 40 divided by 5 is 8. So, Joe sells 8 cars.

Alright, so he sells 8 cars. Now, the problem says he gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, he sold 8 cars, so he gives away twice that number.

Twice 8 is 16. So, he gives away 16 cars to his mother.

So, now, I need to figure out how many cars Joe has left after selling 8 and giving away 16.

He started with 40 cars. He sold 8, so subtract 8: 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.

Then, he gave away 16 cars, so subtract another 16: 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

Wait, that seems right. So, Joe started with 40, sold 8, gave away 16, so 40 - 8 -16 = 16.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, Robert has 20 cars. Joe has twice that, so 40. That's correct.

20% of 40 is 8. So, he sells 8. Then, he gives away twice that, which is 16. So, total cars sold and given away is 8 +16=24. So, 40 -24=16. So, 16 cars left.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 16.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

20% of 40: 0.20 *40. 0.2*40 is 8, so that's correct.

He gives away twice as many as he sold, so 2*8=16. So, 8+16=14 cars sold and given away. 40-14=26. So, 26 left.

Wait, that seems right. So, 26 is the answer.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 16? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
