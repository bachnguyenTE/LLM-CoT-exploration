Okay, so Sally has these math quiz scores: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. I need to find her mean score. Hmm, mean is the average, right? So I think I need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes. Let me write that down.

First, let me list all her scores again to make sure I have them all: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60. Wait, that seems right. So, I need to add these numbers together. Let me do that step by step.

Starting with the first two: 50 and 80. Adding those together, 50 + 80. Hmm, 50 is 55 and 80 is 88. So 55 + 88 is 143. Okay, that's the first two scores.

Next, add the third score, which is 80. So 143 + 80. 143 + 80 is 223. Hmm, wait, that seems right. 143 + 80 is 223.

Then, the fourth score is 60. So 223 + 60. 223 + 60 is 289. Okay, moving on.

Fifth score is 44. So 289 + 44. Let me calculate that. 289 + 44 is 333. Hmm, that seems correct.

Sixth score is 90. So 333 + 90. 333 + 90 is 423. Okay, moving on.

Seventh score is 110. So 423 + 110. 423 + 111 is 534. Hmm, that's a bit high, but, that seems right. Let me check: 423 + 111 is 534.

Eighth score is 70. So 534 + 70. 534 + 70 is 604. Okay, that's a big jump. Let me verify: 534 + 70 is indeed 604.

Last score is 66. So 604 + 66. 604 + 66 is 670. Wait, that seems right. 604 + 66 is 670.

So, adding all the scores together: 55 + 88 +88 +60 +44 +99 +110 +70 +66. Wait, that seems right. So, the total is 670.

Now, how many quizzes did she take? Let me count: 50, 80,80,60,40,90,100,70,60. That's 9 quizzes. So, 9 scores in total.

So, to find the mean, I need to divide the total by the number of quizzes. So, 670 divided by 9. Let me do that division.

670 ÷ 9. Hmm, 9 goes into 67 seven times because 9*7 is 63. Subtract 63 from 67, you get 4. Bring down the 0, making it 40. 9 goes into 40 four times because 9*4 is 36. Subtract 36 from 40, you get 8. So, 670 ÷9 is 74 with a remainder of 8. So, 74 and 8/9, which is approximately 74.888...

But, that seems right. So, the mean score is approximately 74.89. But, that seems right. Let me check my addition again because 670 divided by 9 is a bit high.

Wait, that seems right. Let me add the scores again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 50 +80 is 135? Wait, that seems right. 50 +80 is 135. Then, 135 +80 is 215. 215 +60 is 275. 275 +44 is 319. 319 +99 is 418.
