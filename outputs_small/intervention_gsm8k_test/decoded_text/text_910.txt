Q: Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that. How many acres do the two farms have, together?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Farmer Brown and Farmer Smith's farms. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. That seems straightforward. So, I can write that down: Farmer Brown's farm = 200 acres. Hmm, wait, that seems right. 200 is 200, so yeah, 200 acres.

Now, the next part says Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's. Hmm, okay, so I need to break that down. Let me parse it. "Twice that" of Farmer Brown's farm would be 2 times 200 acres. Then, "1100 acres more than" that amount. So, it's like, first, calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, then add 110 acres to that result.

Let me write that out mathematically. Let me denote Farmer Brown's farm as B and Farmer Smith's farm as S. So, B = 200. Then, S = 2*B + 110. Plugging in the value of B, that would be S = 2*200 + 110.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that. 2 times 200 is... 2*200 is 400, right? So, 2*200 is 400. Then, adding 110 to that. So, 400 + 110. Let me add those together. 400 + 100 is 510, and then plus 10 more is 520. So, Farmer Smith's farm is 520 acres.

Now, the question is asking how many acres do the two farms have together. So, I need to add Farmer Brown's 200 acres and Farmer Smith's 520 acres. Let me do that addition. 200 + 520. Hmm, 200 + 500 is 700, and then plus 20 is 720. So, together, they have 720 acres.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Farmer Brown is 200, twice that is 400, plus 110 is 510. Wait, that seems right.
