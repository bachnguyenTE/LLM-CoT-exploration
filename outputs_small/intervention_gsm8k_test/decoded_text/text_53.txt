Q: A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a mechanic charging different rates for repairing tires on two different days, Thursday and Friday. I need to figure out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the charges. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repair and $40 for each car tire repair. That seems straightforward. So, for each tire, regardless of whether it's a truck or car, the mechanic adds a specific amount to the total revenue.

Now, let's look at Thursday. The problem says the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, I need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday by multiplying the number of each type of tire by their respective charges and then adding them together.

For the truck tires on Thursday: 6 tires * $60 per tire. Let me compute that. 6 times 60. Hmm, 6*60 is 360. So, that's $360 from truck tires.

Then, for the car tires on Thursday: 4 tires * $40 per tire. Let me calculate that. 4*40 is 160. So, that's $160 from car tires.

Now, to find the total revenue on Thursday, I need to add the revenue from truck tires and car tires together. So, $360 + $160. Let me add those: 360 + 160. 300 + 100 is 400, and 60 +60 is 126. Wait, that seems right. So, 360 + 160 is 520. So, the total revenue on Thursday is $520.

Alright, moving on to Friday. The problem states that on Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. So, that means all the tires repaired on Friday were car tires.

So, for Friday, the revenue would be 12 tires * $40 per tire. Let me compute that. 12*40 is 480. So, the total revenue on Friday is $480.

Now, I need to compare the revenues from Thursday and Friday to see how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. So, Thursday was $520 and Friday was $480.

Wait, that seems right. Thursday had $520 and Friday had $480. So, Thursday had more revenue. But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

On Thursday: 6 truck tires at $60 each. 6*60 is indeed 360. 4 car tires at $40 each. 4*40 is 160. 360 + 160 is 520. That's correct.

On Friday: 12 car tires at $40 each. 12*40. Let me compute that again. 10*40 is 400, and 2*40 is 80, so 400 + 80 is 480. That's correct.

So, Thursday's revenue is $520 and Friday's is $480. Therefore, Thursday had more revenue. The question is asking how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. So, I need to subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue to find the difference.

So, $520 (Thursday) minus $480 (Friday) equals... Let me compute that. 520 - 480. 520 - 400 is 80, and then subtract another 80, which would be 0. Wait, that seems right. 520 - 480 is 40. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 520 - 480 is 40. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems
