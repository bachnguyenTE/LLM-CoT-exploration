Q: Josie grows grapes on her 10-acre farm.  Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.  How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes every year. Hmm, I need to figure out how many barrels of wine she gets from her farm each year. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that each acre produces 5 tons. Since she has 10 acres, I should multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre to get the total tons produced in a year. So, 10 acres times 5 tons per acre. Let me write that out: 10 * 5. Hmm, 10 times 5 is 50. So, her farm produces 50 tons of grapes each year. Wait, that seems right. 10 acres times 5 tons is 50 tons. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. So, for each ton, she gets 2 barrels. So, if she has 50 tons, each of those tons can make 2 barrels. So, I need to multiply the total tons by the number of barrels per ton. That would be 50 tons * 2 barrels per ton. Let me calculate that: 50 * 2. Hmm, 50 times 2 is 100. So, 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton is 100 barrels.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 10 acres times 5 tons per acre is 50 tons. 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton is 100 barrels. Yeah, that seems correct. So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 10 acres times 5 tons is 50 tons. 50 tons times 2 is 100. Yeah, that's correct. So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 100 barrels of wine per year. So, I can write that as 100 barrels. So, the final answer is 100 barrels.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes. Maybe I should write it in a different way. So, 10 acres times 5 tons per acre is 50 tons. 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton is 100 barrels. Yeah, that's correct. So, 100 barrels.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 10 acres times 5 tons is 50 tons. Then, 50 tons times 2 barrels is 100 barrels. Yeah, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 10 acres times 5 tons is 50 tons. Then, 50 tons times 2 is 100 barrels. Yeah, same answer.

So, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 100 barrels of wine per year.

**Final Answer**
Josie's farm produces \boxed{100} barrels of wine per year.

Josie has a 10-acre farm, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. To find the total tons of grapes produced, we multiply the number of acres by the tons per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, we multiply the total tons by the number of barrels per ton:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Thus, Josie's farm produces \boxed{100} barrels of wine per year.
