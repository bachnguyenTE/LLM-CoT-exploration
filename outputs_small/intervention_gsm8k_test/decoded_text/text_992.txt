Q: Buford writes many checks every year.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  How many checks does Buford write per year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many checks Buford writes per year. Let me break down the information given step by step.

First, the problem says that Buford writes many checks every year. Specifically, he writes a check once per month for two different expenses: the electric bill and the gas bill. So, let me think about that. If he writes a check every month for the electric bill, that's 12 checks for the electric bill. Similarly, he writes another check every month for the gas bill, which is another 12 checks. So, that's 12 + 12 = 24 checks just for the electric and gas bills.

Next, the problem mentions that he also writes a check every month for the church. It says he does this twice per month. Hmm, so that's 2 checks per month. So, for the church, that's 2 * 12 = 24 checks per year.

Then, there's a mention of a check to the pest and lawn service, but, that seems right. It says he writes a check quarterly. So, a quarter of the year. A year has 12 months, so a check every 3 months. So, how many checks is that? 12 / 3 = 4 checks per year.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me tally up all the checks:

1. Electric bill: 12 checks
2. Gas bill: 12 checks
3. Church: 24 checks
4. Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Adding them all together: 12 + 12 +24 +4. Let me compute that.

12 +12 is 24, plus 24 is 48, plus 4 is 52. So, that would be 52 checks per year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each part.

Electric and gas bills: 12 months each, so 12 +12 =24. That's straightforward.

Church: twice a month, so 2 *12=24. That's correct.

Pest and lawn service: quarterly, so 12 months per check. 12 /3=4. That's correct.

Adding them up: 24 +24 +4=52. Wait, that seems right. 24 for electric and gas, 24 for church, and 4 for pest and lawn. So, 24 +24 is 48, plus 4 is 52. So, 52 checks per year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if I missed anything.

He writes a check every month for electric, gas, and church. That's 3 checks a month, so 3*12=6 checks per year. Then, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which is 4 checks per year. So, total is 6 +4=10 checks per year.
