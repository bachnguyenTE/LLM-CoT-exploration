Q: Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Jana's puppies, and I need to figure out how many puppies she has. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: "Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?"

Alright, let's parse this information. First, two-thirds of all Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, if I let the total number of puppies be, say, P, then the number of Pomeranians would be (2/3)P. That makes sense.

Next, it says that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. So, if there are (2/3)P Pomeranians, then the number of girls among them would be (1/3) of that. So, that would be (1/3)*(2/3)P, which simplifies to (2/9)P. Got that.

And the problem tells me that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, that means (2/9)P equals 6. So, I can set up an equation: (2/9)P = 6. Now, I need to solve for P, which is the total number of puppies.

Let me write that down:

(2/9)P = 6

To solve for P, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/9, which is 9/2. So, multiplying both sides by 9/2:

P = 6 * (9/2)

Let me compute that. 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 3 multiplied by 9 is 27. So, P equals 27.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, total puppies: P.

Pomeranians: (2/3)P.

Girls among Pomeranians: (1/3)*(2/3)P = (2/9)P.

Given that (2/9)P = 6, so P = 6*(9/2) = 27.

Yes, that seems correct. So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using different variables or steps, to confirm.

Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of fractions. If 2/3 of the puppies are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of those are girls, so 1/3 of 2/3 is 2/9. So, 2/9 of the total puppies are girls. And that equals 6. So, 2/9 P =6, so P=6*(9/2)=27.

Same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of ratios or proportions.

Let me denote the number of Pomeranians as P, girls as G, and total puppies as T.

Given that G = (1/3)P, and P = (2/3)T.

So, substituting P into the first equation, G = (1/3)*(2/3)T = (2/9)T.

Given that G=6, so 6 = (2/9)T, so T=6*(9/2)=27.

Same answer again. So, that seems to confirm that the total number of puppies is 27.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a table or a diagram.

Let me try that.

Total puppies: T

Pomeranians: (2/3)T

Girls among Pomeranians: (1/3)*(2/3)T = (2/9)T

Given that (2/9)T =6, so T=6*(9/2)=27.

Same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of units.

Suppose each Pomeranian is a unit. So, if 2/3 of the units are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of those are girls, so 2/9 of the total units are girls. So, 2/9 of the total units is 6, so total units are 27.

Same answer.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of fractions of fractions.

So, girls are 1/3 of Pomeranians, and Pomeranians are 2/3 of total. So, girls are 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/
