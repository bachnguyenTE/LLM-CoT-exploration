Q: The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Brianna and her family when their power goes out. They gather all their candles and flashlights to use. Let me try to figure out how many candles and flashlights they have in total.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are 8 rooms in the house, and 4 people living there, including Brianna. So, each person has their own flashlight, right? And there are two flashlights for each room. Hmm, so that means each room has two flashlights, one for each person. So, 8 rooms times 2 flashlights each would be 16 flashlights in total. That seems straightforward.

Now, about the candles. They have a variety of candles available. It says there are 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. So, let me break that down.

First, half the rooms would be 8 rooms divided by 2, which is 4 rooms. So, for these 4 rooms, each has 4 small candles. Then, the other half, which is also 4 rooms, each has 5 medium candles. So, let me calculate the total number of small candles and medium candles separately.

For the small candles: 4 small candles per room times 4 rooms. That would be 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.

For the medium candles: 5 medium candles per room times 4 rooms. That would be 5 * 4 = 20 medium candles.

So, adding those together, the total number of candles is 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Wait, that seems right. 4 small per room for 4 rooms is 16, and 5 medium per room for 4 rooms is 20, so 16 + 20 is 36. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, in total, they have 36 candles and 16 flashlights. Wait, that seems right. 8 rooms, 2 flashlights each is 16 flashlights. And 4 rooms with 4 small candles each is 16 small candles, and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each is 20 medium candles, so 16 + 20 is 36 candles.

So, adding them together, they have 36 candles and 16 flashlights. So, the total number of items they have is 36 + 16 = 52 items.

But, that seems right. Let me just double-check.

Number of rooms: 8.

Number of people: 4.

Number of flashlights: 2 per room, so 8 * 2 = 16.

Number of candles: 4 small per half of the rooms, so 4 * 4 = 16 small candles. 5 medium per other half, so 5 *4 =20 medium candles. 16 +20=36 candles.

Total items: 36 candles +16 flashlights=52.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 52 items.

But, that seems right. So, the problem is asking how many candles and flashlights they have in total when the power goes out. So, 36 candles and 16 flashlights, which is 52 in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 52.

But, that seems right. Let me just think again.

Number of rooms:8.

Each room has 2 flashlights, so 8*2=16 flashlights. Wait, that seems right. 8 rooms, 2 each, 16.

Number of candles: 4 small per half of the rooms, so 4*4=16 small candles. 5 medium per other half, so 5*4=20 medium candles. 16+20=36 candles.

Total items:16 flashlights +36 candles=52.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 52.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family has is \boxed{52}.

First, we determine the number of flashlights. There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
\[ 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights per room} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, we calculate the number of candles. There are 4 small candles each for half of the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half. Half of 8 rooms is 4
