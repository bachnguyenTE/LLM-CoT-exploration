Q: Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)

Okay, so Billy is helping people with their taxes. Let me try to figure out how many people he can help. Hmm, the problem says he can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. That means each day, he can help 2 people multiplied by 3 hours. Let me write that down.

First, calculate his daily help:
2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Alright, so Billy can help 6 people each day. Now, the next part is about the dates. He takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps on all the other days. I need to figure out how many days that is.

Wait, that seems right. So, first, let's find out how many days are between March 1st and April 19th. March has 31 to 31 days, and April has 1 to 19 days. But, that seems right. So, from March 1st to April 19th, inclusive?

Wait, that seems right. So, March has 31 to 31, which is 1 day, and then April has 1 to 19, which is 19 days. So, total days would be 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me count: March 1st is day 1, and April 19th is day 50? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
