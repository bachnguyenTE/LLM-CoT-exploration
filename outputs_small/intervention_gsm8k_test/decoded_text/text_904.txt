Q: There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies, Deepa has seen each one in the theatre three times. She has spent $216 seeing these movies. What is the average price she paid per ticket?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Deepa and the Fast and Furious movies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says there are 9 movies, and Deepa has seen each one three times. She spent a total of $216 on seeing these movies. They're asking for the average price she paid per ticket. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I need to find the average price per ticket. That means I have to figure out the total amount she spent divided by the total number of tickets she bought. So, I know the total amount is $216. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. So, she saw each of the 9 movies three times. So, the total number of tickets she bought is 9 movies multiplied by 3 tickets each. Let me write that down.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 tickets/movie = 27 tickets.

Okay, so she bought 27 tickets in total. And she spent $216 on all of them. So, to find the average price per ticket, I need to divide the total amount by the total number of tickets. So, that would be $216 divided by 27 tickets.

Wait, that seems right. So, let me write that as a division problem. 216 divided by 27. Hmm, let me compute that. 27 goes into 216 how many times? Let me see. 27 times 8 is 216, right? Because 27*8 is 216. So, 216 divided by 27 is 8. So, the average price per ticket is $8.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If she bought 27 tickets and spent $216, then each ticket on average is $8. That makes sense because 27 times 8 is 216. So, yeah, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, 9 movies, each seen 3 times, so 27 tickets. 27 tickets for $216. So, 216 divided by 27 is 8. So, the average price is $8 per ticket. That seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. So, is there any chance I made a mistake? Let me see. Maybe I misread the problem. It says she has seen each one in the theatre three times. So, 9 movies, each seen 3 times. So, 9*3=27 tickets. Total spent is $216. So, 216 divided by 27 is 8. So, yeah, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total amount per movie. So, each movie is seen 3 times, so each movie costs her 216 divided by 9, which is 24 dollars per movie. Then, since each movie is seen 3 times, the price per ticket would be 24 divided by 3, which is 8. So, that also gives me 8. So, that's another way to think about it.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is $8 per ticket. So, that seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The average price Deepa paid per ticket is \boxed{8}.

Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and Furious movies three times. She spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought:
   \[
   9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ tickets/movie} = 27 \text{ tickets}
   \]

2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket:
   \[
   \frac{216}{27} = 8
   \]

Thus, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is \boxed{8}.
