Q: Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular price for each blouse is $20.  How much is the total cost of the discounted blouses?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Misha is picking out 4 blouses from a rack that's 30% off. Each blouse normally costs $20. I need to figure out how much the total cost of these 4 blouses will be after the discount. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the discount is 30%, which means Misha is paying 67% of the original price for each blouse because 100% minus 30% is 67%. Wait, that seems right. So, if the original price is $20, I need to calculate 30% of $20 and then subtract that from $20 to get the discounted price for one blouse. Alternatively, I can just multiply $20 by 67% to get the discounted price directly. Let me try both methods to see if I get the same result.

Starting with the first method: calculating 30% of $20. So, 30% is the same as 0.3 in decimal form. Multiplying that by $20: 0.3 * 20 = 6.6. So, the discount is $6.60. Then, subtracting that from the original price: 20 - 6.60 = 15.40. So, each blouse is $15.40 after the discount.

Alternatively, using the second method: multiplying $20 by 67%. 67% is 0.67 in decimal. So, 0.67 * 20. Let me calculate that. 0.67 * 20. Hmm, 0.67 * 20. Well, 0.67 * 20 is the same as 0.67 * 20. Let me break it down: 0.67 * 20 = (0.67 * 20). Hmm, 0.67 * 20. Let me compute 0.67 * 20. 0.67 * 20 is equal to 13.40? Wait, that seems right. Because 0.67 * 20 is 13.40. So, that's the discounted price for one blouse.

Wait, that seems right. So, each blouse is $15.40 after the discount. So, if Misha is buying 4 blouses, the total cost would be 4 * 15.40. Let me compute that. 15.40 * 4. 15 * 4 is 60, and 0.40 *4 is 1.60, so adding those together, 60 + 1.60 is 61.60. So, the total cost is $61.60.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 30% off on $20 is 0.3 * 20 = 6.60, so the discounted price is 20 - 6.60 = 13.40. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
