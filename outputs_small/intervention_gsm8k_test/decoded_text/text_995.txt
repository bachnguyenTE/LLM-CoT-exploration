Q: Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Adam buying some new trousers and figuring out how much money he had to contribute from his savings. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. That seems straightforward. So, he spent $30 on the trousers. Now, his mother gave him $6 for this purpose. Hmm, so that's an additional $6. So, I think that means he received money from his mother, which is $6. 

Then, it says his father gave him twice as much. So, if his mother gave him $6, his father gave him twice that amount. Let me calculate that. Twice $6 is $12. So, the father gave him $12. 

Now, the question is asking how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings. So, I think this means we need to figure out how much he had to put into savings to cover the cost of the trousers, considering the money he received from his mother and father.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost of the trousers is $30. He received $6 from his mother and $12 from his father. So, let me add those together to see how much he actually had. 

$6 (from mother) + $12 (from father) = $18. 

So, he received a total of $18 from his parents. But, that seems right. So, the total amount he had from his parents is $18. But, that seems right. So, the cost of the trousers is $30, so he needs to cover the rest from his savings.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount he needs to contribute from his savings is the total cost minus the money he received from his parents. So, that would be $30 - $18. 

Let me do that subtraction. $30 minus $18 is $12. So, that would mean he had to contribute $12 from his savings. 

Wait, that seems right. So, he spent $30 on the trousers, received $18 from his parents, so he needs to put in the remaining $12 from his savings. 

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, $6 from mom, $12 times 6 is $12, so $12 from dad. Wait, that seems right. So, $6 plus $12 is $8.
