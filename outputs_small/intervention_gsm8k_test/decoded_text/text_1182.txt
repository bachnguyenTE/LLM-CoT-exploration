Okay, so I have this problem here where Bob is spending $27,000 on books for three schools. Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me read it again: "Bob spends $27000 distributed between 3 schools to buy books. He can buy 100 books for $500. How many books can he buy per school?" 

Wait, that seems right. So, he's spending a total of $27,000? Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure. So, 27,000 is the total amount he's distributing between three schools. So, he's buying books for each school, and each school gets some number of books. 

But, that seems right. So, the problem is asking how many books he can buy per school. So, he's buying books for three schools, and each school gets the same number of books?
