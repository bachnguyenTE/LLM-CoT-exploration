Q: Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Griffin and his French fries. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes these word problems can get a bit confusing, but, that seems right. Let me read it again.

"Griffin had 24 French fries, but, that seems right. Then, Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Then, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. How many fries did Ginger give Griffin?"

Alright, so let's break this down. First, Griffin starts with 24 fries. Then, Kyle takes 5. So, after that, how many does Griffin have? Let me write that down.

Griffin starts with 24. Then, Kyle takes 5. So, 24 minus 5 is... 19. So, after Kyle takes his fries, Griffin has 19.

Then, Billy takes twice as many as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 2 times 5, which is 10. So, Billy took 10 fries. So, now, how many does Griffin have? He had 19, and then Billy took 10. So, 19 minus 10 is 8. So, after Billy, Griffin has 8 fries.

Now, the next part is a bit more complicated. It says, "Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries." So, let's denote the number of fries that Ginger gave as x. So, after that, Griffin's total fries would be 8 plus x.

Then, "Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken." Okay, so first, how many fries did Kyle take? That was 5. So, 3 less than that would be 5 minus 3, which is 2. So, Colby took 2 fries from Griffin.

So, after Colby took 2, Griffin's total would be 8 plus x (from Ginger) minus 2 (from Colby). And we know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, let's set up the equation.

So, 8 + x - 2 = 27.

Simplify that: 8 - 2 is 6, so 6 + x = 27.

Then, subtract 6 from both sides: x = 27 - 6, which is 21.

So, x is 21. So, Ginger gave Griffin 21 fries.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Starting with Griffin: 24.

Kyle takes 5: 24 -5 =19.

Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is 10: 19 -10 =8.

Ginger gives x: 8 + x.

Then, Colby takes 3 less than Kyle, which is 2: 8 + x -2 =27.

So, 6 + x =27, so x=21.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 21.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire process step by step.

Start: Griffin =24.

After Kyle takes 5: 24 -5=19.

After Billy takes 10:19 -10=8.

Then, let's say Ginger gives x fries to Griffin: 8 +x.

Then, Colby takes 3 less than Kyle's original take, which is 5-3=2. So, Colby takes 2 from Griffin: 8 +x -2.

And that equals 27.

So, 8 +x -2=27.

So, 6 +x=27.

x=21.

Same result. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the net change.

Griffin started with 24.

Then, Kyle took 5, so that's a loss of 5.

Then, Billy took 10, so that's a loss of 10.

Then, Colby took 2, so that's a loss of 2.

So, total loss: 5 +10 +2=17.

So, 24 -17=7.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 24 -17=7.

But, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, why is the final number 2
