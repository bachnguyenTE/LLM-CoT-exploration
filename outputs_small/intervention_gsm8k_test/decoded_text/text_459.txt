Q: A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Okay, so I need to figure out how many trips the farmer needs to transport all his feed in his truck. The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, and he has several types of feed: hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Each type has different quantities and weights, so I need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and then see how many trips he needs to make to carry them all.

First, let me list out all the feed items and their quantities:

1. **Hay**: He buys forty-two 75-pound bales.
2. **Oats**: He buys twenty 65-pound sacks.
3. **Carrots**: He buys four 12-pound bags.
4. **Sugar Cubes**: He buys two 1-pound boxes.

I need to calculate the total weight for each type of feed and then add them all together. Let me start with each item one by one.

**Hay:**
He buys forty-two 75-pound bales. So, to find the total weight of hay, I multiply the number of bales by the weight per bale.

Total weight of hay = 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale.

Let me compute that. 42 times 75. Hmm, 40*75 is 3000, and 2*75 is 150, so 3000 + 150 is 3450 pounds. So, hay is 3450 pounds.

**Oats:**
He buys twenty 65-pound sacks. So, total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack.

Total weight of oats = 20 * 65.

Calculating that: 20*60 is 1200, and 20*5 is 100, so 1200 + 100 is 1300 pounds. So, oats are 1300 pounds.

**Carrots:**
He buys four 12-pound bags. So, total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag.

Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 8 pounds.

**Sugar Cubes:**
He buys two 1-pound boxes. So, total weight of sugar cubes is 2 boxes * 1 pound/box.

Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, let me add up all these weights to get the total feed needed.

Total feed = Hay + Oats + Carrots + Sugar Cubes
Total feed = 3450 + 1300 + 8 + 2.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3450 + 1300. That's 4750 pounds.

Then, 4750 + 8 = 4758 pounds.

Then, 4758 + 2 = 4760 pounds.

So, the total weight of all the feed is 4760 pounds.

Now, the truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, I need to figure out how many trips are needed to carry 4760 pounds.

To find the number of trips, I can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the next whole number if there's any remainder.

So, 4760 divided by 2250.

Let me compute that.

First, 2250 * 2 = 4500.

Subtract that from 4760: 4760 - 4500 = 260.

So, 2 full trips would carry 4500 pounds, and then there's 260 pounds left.

Since the truck can't make a partial trip, he needs to make another trip for the remaining 260 pounds.

So, total trips needed: 2 + 1 = 3 trips.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Total feed: 3450 + 1300 +8 +2 = 3450 +1300 is 4755, plus 8 is 4763, plus 2 is 4765. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
