Q: Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in "rabbit" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?

Okay, so Chris has this two-speed lawn mower that can mow his entire lawn in turtle mode in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, and in rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. The question is, how many minutes did it take him to mow the entire lawn?

Hmm, let me think about this. So, first, I need to figure out the rates at which Chris's lawn mower works in turtle and rabbit modes. Then, since he's mowing half the lawn in each mode, I can calculate the time taken for each half and add them together to get the total time.

Alright, let's start by finding the mowing rates. In turtle mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes. So, his rate in turtle mode is 1 lawn per 60 minutes, or 1/60 lawns per minute. Similarly, in rabbit mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is 1/40 lawns per minute.

Now, he's mowing half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. So, for each half, we can calculate the time taken.

Let me denote the total area of the lawn as 1 (for simplicity). Then, half the lawn is 0.5.

First, mowing half the lawn in turtle mode. His rate is 1/60 per minute, so the time taken for half the lawn would be (0.5) / (1/60). Let me compute that.

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes. So, 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.

Similarly, mowing half the lawn in rabbit mode. His rate is 1/40 per minute, so the time taken is (0.5) / (1/40) = 0.5 *40 = 20 minutes. So, 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.

Therefore, the total time is 30 +20 =50 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of work rates. The combined work rate when mowing half in each mode.

But, that seems right. So, the total time is 50 minutes.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total work done as 1 lawn. He does half in turtle and half in rabbit.

So, the time taken is (0.5)/(1/60) + (0.5)/(1/40) = 30 +20=50.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the rates.

Let me denote the time taken as T.

He mows half the lawn in turtle mode, so the time is (0.5)/(1/60) =30.

He mows the other half in rabbit mode, so the time is (0.5)/(1/40)=20.

Total time is 30+20=50.

Yes, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the rates as fractions.

In turtle mode, the rate is 1/60 per minute.

In rabbit mode, the rate is 1/40 per minute.

So, mowing half the lawn in turtle mode: time = (1/2) / (1/60) = (1/2)*(60) =30.

Similarly, mowing half in rabbit mode: time=(1/2)/(1/40)=20.

Total time:30+20=50.

Yes, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total work as 1, and the work done in each mode.

So, work done in turtle mode: 0.5 = (1/60)*t1.

So, t1=0.5*60=30.

Similarly, work done in rabbit mode:0.5=(1/40)*t2.

So, t2=0.5*40=20.

Total time:30+20=50.

Yes, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the rates as fractions of the lawn per minute.

So, in turtle mode, he can mow 1/60 per minute.

In rabbit mode, he can mow 1/40 per minute.

So, mowing half the lawn in turtle mode: time= (1/2)/(1/60)=30.

Similarly, mowing half in rabbit mode:
