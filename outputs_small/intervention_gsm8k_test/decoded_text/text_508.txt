Q: The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.  How many animals do the farm and zoo have combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a farm and a zoo with different animals, and I need to figure out how many animals they have combined. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says the farm has 30 cows. That seems straightforward. Then, the zoo has 20 sheep. Hmm, okay. Now, the next part says the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Wait, that seems right. So if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo must have double that number. Let me write that down.

So, farm cows = 30. Zoo cows = 2 * farm cows = 2 * 30 = 60. So the zoo has 60 cows. Got that.

Then, the problem mentions the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. The zoo has 20 sheep, so half of that would be 10 sheep on the farm. Let me check that. If the zoo has 20 sheep, then half of that is 10. So farm sheep = 10. That makes sense.

Now, I need to find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined. So, I should add up all the animals from both places.

Starting with the farm: it has 30 cows and 10 sheep. So, 30 + 10 = 43 animals on the farm.

Now, the zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep. So, 60 +20 =80 animals in the zoo.

To find the combined total, I add the farm animals and the zoo animals together: 43 +80. Let me do that addition. 43 +80 is 123.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Farm: 30 cows +10 sheep =43. Zoo:60 cows +20 sheep=80. 43 +80=123. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, the combined total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 123.

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. I just need to make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 20 sheep, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so 60 cows, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so 10 sheep. Adding them up gives 43 on the farm and 80 in the zoo, totaling 123. Yeah, that seems solid.

**Final Answer**
The combined total number of animals is \boxed{123}.

The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(20 / 2 = 10\) sheep.

The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, totaling \(30 + 10 = 43\) animals.

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, totaling \(60 + 20 = 80\) animals.

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo gives \(43 + 80 = 123\).

The combined total number of animals is \(\boxed{123}\).
