Q: Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Samwell's appliances store, and I need to figure out how many OLED TVs they sold this week. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

It says that for this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. They sold a total of 40 TVs. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, the total number of TVs sold is 40. I need to find out how many of those were OLED TVs.

Alright, let's break this down. First, the problem is about fractions of the total sales. So, one-fourth and one-eighth are given, and the rest are OLED. So, I think I can model this by adding up the fractions of smart TVs and analog TVs, and then subtracting that from the total to find the fraction that's OLED.

Let me write that out. So, the fraction of smart TVs is 1/4, and the fraction of analog TVs is 1/8. So, if I add those together, I can find the combined fraction of TVs that are not OLED. Then, subtracting that from 1 will give me the fraction of TVs that are OLED.

So, let's compute 1/4 plus 1/8. To add these fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators here are 4 and 8, so 8 is a common denominator. So, 1/4 is equal to 2/8, right? Because 1 times 2 is 2, and 4 times 2 is 8. So, 1/4 is 2/8. Then, adding 2/8 and 1/8 gives me 3/8. So, 3/8 of the sales are not OLED TVs.

Therefore, the fraction of TVs that are OLED must be 1 minus 3/8. Let me compute that. 1 is the same as 8/8, so 8/8 minus 3/8 is 5/8. So, 5/8 of the sales are OLED TVs.

Now, since the total number of TVs sold is 40, I can find the number of OLED TVs by multiplying 5/8 by 40. Let me write that out: 5/8 of 40.

To compute this, I can do 40 multiplied by 5, which is 200, and then divide by 8. So, 200 divided by 8. Let me do that division. 8 goes into 200 how many times? 8 times 25 is 200, right? Because 8 times 20 is 160, and 8 times 5 is 40, so 160 plus 40 is 200. So, 200 divided by 8 is 25.

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I converted 1/4 to 2/8 and 1/8 remains as is. Then, adding 2/8 and 1/8 gives 3/8. Subtracting that from 1 gives 5/8. Then, multiplying 5/8 by 40 gives 25. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it another way. Maybe I can find the number of smart TVs and analog TVs separately and then subtract their sum from the total to find the number of OLED TVs.

So, let's try that approach. If 1/4 of 40 is the number of smart TVs, that would be 40 divided by 4, which is 10. So, 10 smart TVs.

Similarly, 1/8 of 40 is the number of analog TVs. 40 divided by 8 is 5. So, 5 analog TVs.

Adding those together, 10 plus 5 is 15. So, 15 TVs are not OLED. Therefore, the number of OLED TVs is 40 minus 15, which is 35. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
