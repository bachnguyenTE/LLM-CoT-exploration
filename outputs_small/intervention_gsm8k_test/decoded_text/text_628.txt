Q: Adam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam’s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?

Okay, so Adam wants to ride this biggest roller coaster, and he needs to be 4 feet tall. Hmm, let me think about how to figure out how many years it will take him to grow tall enough. 

First, I know that the roller coaster requires 4 feet, but, that seems right. I should probably convert that height into inches because Adam's current height is given in inches. I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet would be 4 times 12. Let me calculate that: 4 times 12 is 48. So, 4 feet is 48 inches. Got that down.

Now, Adam's current height is 40 inches. Wait, that seems right. 40 inches is a bit over 3 feet because 3 feet is 36 inches. So, 40 inches is 3 feet and 4 inches. That makes sense because 40 inches is more than 3 feet. 

He grows 2 inches every year. So, I need to figure out how many years it will take for him to grow from 40 inches to 48 inches. To do that, I think I can subtract his current height from the required height and then divide by how much he grows each year. That should give me the number of years needed.

Let me write that down as an equation. The required height is 48 inches, and his current height is 40 inches. So, the difference is 48 minus 40. Let me compute that: 48 minus 40 is 8 inches. So, he needs to grow 8 inches to reach the required height.

He grows 2 inches each year, so I need to divide the total inches he needs to grow by his annual growth rate. That would be 8 divided by 2. Let me do that: 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, that suggests it will take him 4 years to grow 8 inches, which is the difference between his current height and the required height.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 48 inches minus 40 inches is indeed 8 inches. 8 inches divided by 2 inches per year is 4 years. So, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. Let me think about it another way. If he grows 2 inches each year, then in one year, he'll be 40 + 2 = 42 inches. In two years, 42 + 2 = 44 inches. In three years, 44 + 2 = 46 inches. And in four years, 46 + 2 = 48 inches. So, that's exactly the required height. So, that checks out.

So, it will take him 4 years to reach the required height. Therefore, the answer should be 4 years.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, 48 inches minus 40 inches is 8 inches. 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, 4 years. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of linear growth. His height as a function of time can be represented as h(t) = 40 + 2t, where t is the number of years. We need to find t when h(t) = 48. So, 40 + 2t = 48. Subtract 40 from both sides: 2t = 8. Divide both sides by 2: t=4. So, that's another way to look at it, and it still gives me 4 years.

So, I think that's solid. It's 4 years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4}

Adam wants to ride a roller coaster that requires 4 feet of height. To convert this height into inches, we know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference between the required height and his current height is \(48 - 40 = 8\) inches. Adam grows 2 inches each year. Therefore, the number of years required for him to grow 8 inches is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years.

Thus, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is \(\boxed{4}\).
