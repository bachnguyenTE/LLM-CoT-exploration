Q: Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?

Okay, so Mary has this problem about her potted plants. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Mary is an avid gardener. She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. She feels generous and is going to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. The question is, how many potted plants will Mary remain with?

Alright, so let's break this down. Mary has 18 new potted plants. She already has some potted plants on her window ledges. Each of the 40 ledges has 2 potted plants. So, first, I need to figure out how many potted plants she already has in total.

To find that, I can multiply the number of ledges by the number of potted plants per ledge. So, 40 ledges times 2 potted plants per ledge. Let me write that out:

40 ledges * 2 potted plants/ledge = 80 potted plants.

So, Mary already has 80 potted plants. Then, she received 18 more. So, the total number of potted plants she has before giving any away is 80 + 18. Let me calculate that:

80 + 18 = 98 potted plants.

Okay, so she has 98 potted plants in total. Now, she is going to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges to her friends and family. So, she's giving away 40 potted plants in total. Each potted plant is from a different ledge, so she's giving one from each of the 40 ledges.

So, she's giving away 40 potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will have left is the total she has minus the ones she's giving away. So, 98 - 40. Let me compute that:

98 - 40 = 58.

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants remaining after giving away 40.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the number of potted plants she already has: 40 ledges * 2 potted plants per ledge. 40*2 is 80. That seems correct.

Then, she received 18 more, so 80 +18 is 98. That also seems correct.

Then, she is giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges. So, 40 potted plants given away. 98 -40 is 58. That makes sense.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 58 potted plants.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total number of potted plants she has is 98, and she is giving away 40, so 98 -40 is 58. Yeah, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of potted plants she has is 98, and she is giving away 40, so 98 -40 is 58. Yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think 58 is the correct answer.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. She has 40 ledges, each with 2 potted plants, so 80. She gets 18 more, so 98. She gives away 1 from each of the 40 ledges, so 40 potted plants. 98 -40 is 58. So, 58 potted plants remain.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think 58 is the correct answer.

But, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 58.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 58.

**Final Answer**
Mary will remain with \boxed{58} potted plants.

Mary has 18 new potted plants and already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:
\[
40 \text{ ledges} \times 2 \text{ potted plants per ledge} = 80 \text{ potted
