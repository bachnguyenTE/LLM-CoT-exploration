Q: Alani's family decided that the children should write stories of any kind. They were then required to read all of the stories they'd written to the family at the end of the weekend. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, her brother Braylen wrote 40 stories, and her sister Margot wrote 60 stories. If they each doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week in the second week, calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether.

Okay, so I have this problem here about Alani's family and their reading of stories. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. Then her brother, Braylen, wrote 40 stories, and her sister, Margot, wrote 60 stories. So, that's the initial number of stories each of them wrote. 

Then, it says that in the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. Hmm, okay, so that means each of them wrote twice as many as they did in the first week. I need to calculate the total number of stories they wrote altogether after both weeks.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I should find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they doubled their first week's count, I can calculate that by multiplying each of their first week totals by 2.

Starting with Alani: she wrote 20 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she wrote 20 times 2. Let me do that multiplication: 20 * 2. Hmm, 20 times 2 is 40. So, Alani wrote 40 stories in the second week.

Next, Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she doubled that. That would be 40 * 2. Let me calculate that: 40 * 2 is 80. So, Braylen wrote 80 stories in the second week.

Then, Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. So, in the second week, she doubled that as well. That would be 60 * 2. Let me do that: 60 * 2 is 120. So, Margot wrote 120 stories in the second week.

Now, I need to find the total number of stories they wrote altogether. That means I have to add up all the stories each person wrote over both weeks. So, I have Alani's total, Braylen's total, and Margot's total.

Let me write that down:

- Alani's total: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week)
- Braylen's total: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week)
- Margot's total: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week)

Wait, that seems right. So, I need to add each of their totals together.

Let me calculate each person's total first.

Starting with Alani: 20 + 40. Hmm, 20 plus 40 is 60. So, Alani wrote a total of 60 stories.

Braylen: 40 + 80. That's 120. So, Braylen wrote a total of 120 stories.

Margot: 60 + 120. That's 180. So, Margot wrote a total of 180 stories.

Now, to find the overall total, I need to add up all their totals: Alani's 60, Braylen's 120, and Margot's 180.

So, 60 + 120 + 180. Let me add them step by step.

First, 60 + 120. That's 180. Then, 180 + 180. Hmm, 180 + 180 is 360. So, altogether, they wrote 360 stories.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Alani: 20 + 40 = 60. Correct.

Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120. Correct.

Margot: 60 + 120 = 180. Correct.

Total: 60 + 120 = 180; 180 + 180 = 360. Hmm, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can add them all together in a different order to see if I get the same result.

Let me add Alani and Margot first: 60 + 180. That's 246. Then, add Braylen's 120: 246 + 120. 246 + 100 is 346, plus 20 is 366. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
