Q: Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they have a monthly interest rate of 2%. Mandy was able to pay after 3 months, and we need to figure out how much she should give. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that when money is owed with interest, the amount owed grows over time. Since the interest is compounded monthly, each month the interest is calculated on the current balance, which includes the principal and the accumulated interest.

So, Mandy owes $100 initially. The interest rate is 2% per month. That means each month, the amount owed increases by 2% of the current balance.

Let me write down the formula for compound interest. The formula is:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Wait, that seems right. Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($100 in this case).
- r is the monthly interest rate (2%, which is 0.02 in decimal).
- n is the number of months the money is borrowed for (3 months here).

So plugging in the numbers:

A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 1 + 0.02, which is 1.02.

Then, raise 1.02 to the power of 3. Hmm, 1.02 multiplied by itself three times.

Let me compute 1.02 * 1.02 first. That's 1.0404. Then, multiply that by 1.02 again.

1.0404 * 1.02. Let's see, 1.0404 * 1.02. Hmm, 1 times 1.02 is 1.02, 0.0404 times 1.02 is approximately 0.0414. So adding those together, 1.02 + 0.0414 = 1.0614.

Wait, that seems right. So 1.02^3 is approximately 1.061208. Let me check that with a calculator.

Wait, that seems right. 1.02^3 is 1.061208. So, 1.02^3 is 1.061208. So, 1.02^3 is 1.061208.

So, A = 100 * 1.061208 = 106.1208.

So, approximately $106.12.

But, that seems right. Let me verify.

Alternatively, I can compute it month by month.

First month: $100 * 1.02 = $102.

Second month: $102 *1.02 = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

Third month: $104.04 *1.02 = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208.

So, that's $106.1208, which is approximately $106.12.

So, rounding to the nearest cent, it's $106.12.

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is $106.12.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to compute it.

Alternatively, using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

So, 100*(1 + 0.02)^3 = 100*(1.02)^3.

Calculating 1.02^3:

1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404

1.0404 * 1.02:

Let me compute 1.0404 * 1.02.

Wait, that seems right. 1.0404 *1.02.

Wait, that seems right. 1.0404 *1.02 is 1.0404 + 0.020888 = 1.061208.

So, 1.02^3 is 1.061208.

So, 100 * 1.161208 is 106.1208.

So,
