Q: Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam decides to slice 3 large and 5 small apples and then eats 15 slices. How many apple slices are left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Adam and his apples. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Adam wants to eat some sliced apples. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and a small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam decides to slice 3 large and 5 small apples. Then he eats 15 slices. The question is, how many apple slices are left?

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to calculate the total number of apple slices Adam has after slicing the apples, and then subtract the number of slices he eats. That should give me the number of slices left. 

So, starting with the large apples. Each large apple makes 5 slices. Adam is slicing 3 large apples. So, I can calculate the total slices from the large apples by multiplying 3 by 5. Let me write that down:

3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices.

Wait, that seems right. 3 times 5 is 15. So, 15 slices from the large apples.

Now, moving on to the small apples. Each small apple makes 3 slices. Adam is slicing 5 small apples. So, I need to multiply 5 by 3 to get the total slices from the small ones.

5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices.

Hmm, that makes sense. 5 times 3 is 15. So, 15 slices from the small apples.

Now, to find the total number of apple slices Adam has, I need to add the slices from the large apples and the slices from the small apples together.

Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
Total slices = 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Wait, that seems right. 15 from the large and 15 from the small, so 30 in total.

Now, Adam eats 15 slices. So, to find out how many slices are left, I subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices he had.

Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
Slices left = 30 -15 = 15 slices.

So, 15 slices are left.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

3 large apples *5 slices each: 3*5=15. That's correct.

5 small apples *3 slices each:5*3=15. That's also correct.

Total slices:15+15=30. Yep, that's right.

Slices eaten:15. So, 30-15=15. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 15 slices left.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 3 large apples make 15 slices, 5 small apples make 15 slices, so 30 total. He eats 15, so 15 left. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. So, the answer should be 15 slices left.

**Final Answer**
The number of apple slices left is \boxed{15}.

Adam slices 3 large apples and 5 small apples. Each large apple makes 5 slices, and each small apple makes 3 slices. 

First, calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so subtract the number of slices he ate from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The number of apple slices left is \boxed{15}.
