Q: Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

Okay, so I have this problem here where Katy makes coffee using a ratio of 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water. She used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. I need to find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but, that seems right. So, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. That means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. So, the total number of parts is 7 + 13, which is 20 parts. So, 20 parts in total.

But, that seems right. So, if the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoonfuls, then each part must be equal to 120 divided by 20. Let me write that down.

Total parts = 7 + 13 = 20

Total amount = 120

So, each part is 120 / 20. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 120 how many times? 20 times 5 is 100, so 5 times with a remainder of 20. So, 5.5? Wait, that seems right. 20 times 5.5 is 110, which is 120? Wait, that seems right. 20 times 5 is 100, and 20 times 5.5 is 110, which is 120. Wait, that seems right. So, each part is 5.5.

So, each part is 5.5. So, the amount of sugar is 7 parts. So, 7 times 5.5. Let me compute that. 7 times 5 is 35, and 7 times 0.5 is 3.5, so 35 + 3.5 is 38.5. So, 38.5 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my steps again.

1. The ratio is 7:13, so total parts are 20.

2. Total amount is 120.

3. Each part is 120 / 20 = 6.
