Q: Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. How many years separate the age of the two now? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, right now, how old is Jame? If in 5 years he'll be 27, then right now he must be 27 minus 5. Let me write that down:

Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Okay, so Jame is 22 now. Now, moving on to his cousin. It says, "In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age." Hmm, okay. So, let's break that down.

First, in 8 years, the cousin's age will be... Well, let's denote the cousin's current age as C. So, in 8 years, the cousin will be C + 8 years old.

Now, it says that this cousin's age in 8 years will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age is 2 * 22, which is 44. Then, 5 years younger than that would be 44 - 5 = 39.

So, in 8 years, the cousin will be 39 years old. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

C + 8 = 39

To find the cousin's current age, we subtract 8 from both sides:

C = 39 - 8 = 31

So, the cousin is currently 31 years old. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

If the cousin is 31 now, in 8 years, he'll be 39. Twice Jame's age is 2*22=44, and 5 years younger than that is 39. Yep, that matches. So, cousin is 31 now.

Now, the question is asking how many years separate the age of the two now. So, that would be the difference between the cousin's current age and Jame's current age.

So, cousin's age - Jame's age = 31 - 22 = 9.

So, the age difference is 9 years. Therefore, the answer should be 9.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Jame's current age: 27 years from now is 27, so 27 -5=22. That's correct.

Cousin's age in 8 years: twice Jame's age is 44, 5 years younger is 39. So cousin is 31 now. 31 -22=9. Yep, that's correct.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 9 years.

**Final Answer**
The number of years separating their ages is \boxed{9}.
</think>

Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
\[ 2 \times 22 = 44 \]
Five years younger than that is:
\[ 44 - 5 = 39 \]

Let \( C \) be the cousin's current age. In 8 years, the cousin will be:
\[ C + 8 = 39 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

The cousin is currently 31 years old. The difference in their ages is:
\[ 31 - 22 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of years separating their ages is \(\boxed{9}\).
