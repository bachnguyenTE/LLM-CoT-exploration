Q: Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?

Okay, so I have this problem about Rory retrieving tennis balls from a tennis match. It says that in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. In total, he retrieved 19 balls. I need to find out how many balls he got in the first set.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. It sounds like a system of equations problem. Let me assign variables to each set to make it clearer.

Let me denote the number of balls in the second set as x. Then, according to the problem, the first set would have four more than the second, so that would be x + 4. The third set is half as many as the second, so that would be x/2.

So, if I add up all the balls from the three sets, it should equal 19. So, the equation would be:

First set + Second set + Third set = 19

Which translates to:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Now, let me write that out:

x + 4 + x + (x/2) = 19

Let me combine like terms. So, x + x is 2x, and then we have 4 + (x/2). So, the equation becomes:

2x + (x/2) + 4 = 19

Hmm, okay, so I can combine the x terms. 2x is the same as (4x)/2, so adding (4x)/2 and (x)/2 gives (5x)/2. So, the equation is:

(5x)/2 + 4 = 19

Now, I can subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with x:

(5x)/2 = 19 - 4

Which is:

(5x)/2 = 15

Now, to solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 2:

5x = 30

Then, divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

So, x is 6. That means the second set had 6 balls. Then, the first set had x + 4, which is 6 + 4 = 10. The third set had x/2, which is 6/2 = 3.

Let me check if that adds up to 19:

First set:10, Second set:6, Third set:3. 10 + 6 + 3 = 19. Yep, that works.

So, the number of balls in the first set is 10.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Let x be the number of balls in the second set.
2. First set: x + 4
3. Third set: x/2
4. Total: (x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19
5. Combine like terms: 2x + x/2 +4 =19
6. Convert 2x to 4x/2: 4x/2 + x/2 =5x/2
7. So, 5x/2 +4=19
8. Subtract 4:5x/2=5
9. Multiply by 2:5x=10
10. Divide by5:x=2
