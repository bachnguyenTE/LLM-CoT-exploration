Q: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?

Okay, so I have this relay race problem here. It's a 4 by 4000 meter relay, meaning each team has four members, each running a 400 meter lap. There are two teams: the faster team and the slower team. The question is asking how many seconds the faster team will win by.

Let me break down the information given.

First, the faster team: each of their four members runs their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, each runner takes 55 seconds to complete their part. Since there are four runners, the total time for the relay would be 4 times 55 seconds. Let me calculate that.

4 * 55 = 220 seconds. So, the faster team's total time is 220 seconds.

Now, the slower team: their first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. Then, each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 63 seconds, the third runner takes 63 - 3 = 60 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 66 seconds. Wait, that seems right. Let me list them out:

1st runner: 60 seconds
2nd runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
3rd runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
4th runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Wait, that seems right. So, the times for the slower team are 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the total time for the slower team. That would be the sum of these four times.

60 + 57 + 54 + 51.

Let me add them step by step:

60 + 57 = 117

117 + 54 = 171

171 + 51 = 222 seconds.

So, the total time for the slower team is 222 seconds.

Wait, that seems right. So, the faster team takes 220 seconds, and the slower team takes 222 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Faster team: 4 runners, each 55 seconds. 4*55=220. Correct.

Slower team: 60, 57, 54, 51.

Adding them: 60+57=117, 117+54=171, 171+51=222. Correct.

So, 222 - 220 = 2 seconds. So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 2 seconds.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Wait, that seems right. So, the faster team is 2 seconds faster. So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 2 seconds.
