Q: A landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer’s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a landscaping company delivering flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. The question is asking how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. They want to know how many trucks are needed to carry 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, without exceeding the truck's weight limit of 2000 pounds. So, I think I need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones and then see how many trucks are required to carry that weight.

Let me write down the given information:

- Weight of each flagstone = 75 pounds
- Total weight capacity of a truck = 2000 pounds
- Number of flagstones to be transported in one trip = 80

So, first, I should find the total weight of 80 flagstones. Since each flagstone is 75 pounds, the total weight would be 80 multiplied by 75. Let me calculate that.

80 flagstones * 75 pounds per flagstone. Hmm, 80 times 75. Let me break that down. 80 * 75 is the same as 80 * 75. I can compute this as (80 * 70) + (80 * 5). Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of 75 as 70 + 5, so 80 * 70 is 5600, and 80 *5 is 400. Adding those together, 5600 + 400 is 6000. Wait, that seems right. So, 80 flagstones would weigh 6000 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 75 pounds per flagstone, 80 flagstones. 75 * 80. 75 * 80. 75 * 80 is 6000. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds. Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds? That would be 6000 divided by 2000.

Let me compute that. 6000 divided by 2000 is 3. So, 3 trucks. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, 3 trucks can carry 6000 pounds, which is exactly the weight of 80 flagstones. So, 3 trucks are needed.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, 2000 pounds per truck. So, 2000 * 3 is 6000 pounds. So, 3 trucks can carry 6000 pounds. So, 80 flagstones weigh 6000 pounds, so 3 trucks can carry exactly 6000 pounds, which is less than 6000. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
