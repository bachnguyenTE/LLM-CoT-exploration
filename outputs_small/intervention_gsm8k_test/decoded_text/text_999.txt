Q: A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem where a family of 6, which includes 2 adults and 4 kids, are going to divide a watermelon. The rule is that each adult gets a slice that's twice as big as each kid. I need to figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably visualize the watermelon. It's a three-dimensional object, but, that seems right. So, the watermelon is going to be divided into slices, some for adults and some for kids. Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. So, if I can figure out how many slices each adult and each kid get, I can then determine the percentage each adult gets.

Let me denote the size of a kid's slice as, say, x. Then, each adult's slice would be 2x. So, each kid gets x, each adult gets 2x. Now, how many slices are there in total? Well, there are 2 adults and 4 kids, so that's 6 people in total. So, if each person gets one slice, there would be 6 slices in total. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if each kid gets x, and each adult gets 2x, then the total amount of watermelon would be 4x (for the kids) plus 2*2x (for the adults), which is 4x + 4x = 8x. So, the total watermelon is 8x.

But, that seems right. So, each kid gets x, each adult gets 2x, so 4x + 4x = 8x. So, the total watermelon is 8x. So, each person gets 8x divided by 6 people, which is (8/6)x, which simplifies to (4/3)x. So, each person, whether kid or adult, gets (4/3)x of the watermelon.

Wait, that seems right. So, each kid gets x, each adult gets 2x, so each person gets (4/3)x. So, each adult gets (4/3)x, which is 4/3 of x. So, to find the percentage, I need to express (4/3)x as a percentage of the whole watermelon, which is 8x.

So, the percentage each adult gets is [(4/3)x / 8x] * 100%. Let me compute that. The x cancels out, so it's (4/3)/8 * 100%. That's (4/24) * 100%, which is (1/6) * 100%. So, 1/6 is approximately 0.166666..., so 16.666...%. So, each adult gets approximately 16.67% of the watermelon.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, total watermelon is 8x, each person gets (4/3)x, so each person is getting 4/3 divided by 8, which is 4/(3*8) = 4/24 = 1/6, which is about 16.67%. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of fractions. If each kid gets x, and each adult gets 2x, then the total is 4x + 4x = 8x. So, each person gets 8x divided by 6, which is 4/3x. So, each adult gets 4/3x, which is 4/3 divided by 8, which is 1/6, which is 16.666...%. So, yeah, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of ratios. The ratio of the watermelon each adult gets to each kid is 2:1. So, for each kid, the adult gets twice as much. So, the total watermelon is divided into 4 kids and 2 adults, so 6 portions. Each portion is 1/6 of the watermelon. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, each kid gets 1/6, each adult gets 2*(1/6) = 1/3. So, each adult gets 1/3, which is 33.33...%, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait
