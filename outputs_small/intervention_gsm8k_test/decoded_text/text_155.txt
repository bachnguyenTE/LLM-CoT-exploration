Q: Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Bill bakes different types of baked goods every day, and I need to figure out how long they will be if he puts all of them end to end. The question is asking for the total length in feet. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what Bill does each day:

- He bakes 300 rolls.
- He bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- He bakes 60 baguettes.

Each type of baked good has a different length:

- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Each baguette is two feet long.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to calculate the total length of all these baked goods combined and then convert that from inches to feet. That makes sense.

Let me start by calculating the total length for each type of baked good separately. That way, I can add them up without getting confused.

Starting with the rolls. He bakes 300 rolls, each 4 inches long. So, the total length for the rolls would be:

300 rolls * 4 inches per roll.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

Rolls: 300 * 4 inches.

Similarly, for the croissants, he bakes 120 of them, each 6 inches long. So:

Croissants: 120 * 6 inches.

And for the baguettes, he bakes 60 of them, each 2 feet long. Hmm, but, that seems right. So:

Baguettes: 60 * 2 feet.
