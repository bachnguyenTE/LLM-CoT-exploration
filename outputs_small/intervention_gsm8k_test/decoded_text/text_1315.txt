Q: There are some oranges in a basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Ana and Jane peeling oranges. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. They start peeling oranges at the same time, and we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour. Hmm, okay.

Alright, so let's break this down. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. Similarly, Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. We need to find out how many oranges each of them can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

An hour is 60 minutes, right? So, let me calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes.

Starting with Ana. If she peels one orange every 3 minutes, then in 60 minutes, how many oranges can she peel? I think I can use division here. So, 60 divided by 3. Let me do that: 60 ÷ 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 6 twice, and 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, that's 20. Wait, that seems right. 3 times 20 is 60. So, Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour.

Now, Jane. She takes 4 minutes per orange. So, in 60 minutes, how many oranges can she peel? Again, division. 60 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 4 goes into 6 once, with a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times. So, that's 15. So, Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour.

Wait, that seems right. 4 times 15 is 60. Yeah, that checks out.

So, Ana peeled 20 oranges, Jane peeled 15. The question is asking how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane. So, I need to subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number Ana peeled.

20 minus 15. That's 5. So, Ana has peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Ana: 60 ÷ 3 is 20. Jane: 60 ÷4 is 15. 20 -15 is 5. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any errors here. It's a straightforward rate problem where I just need to find the number of oranges each can peel in an hour and then find the difference. So, the answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
The number of more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour is \boxed{5}.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 3 minutes. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is 1 orange per 4 minutes. We need to find out how many oranges each of them can peel in 60 minutes (an hour) and then find the difference.

First, calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
\]

Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 - 15 = 5
\]

The number of more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour is \boxed{5}.
