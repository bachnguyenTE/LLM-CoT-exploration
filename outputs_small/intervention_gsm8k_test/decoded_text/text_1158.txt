Q: The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?

Okay, so I have this problem here about the Hortex company producing bottled carrot juices. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

Every day, Hortex can make 4200 bottles of juice. Each of these bottles can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, if I have one bottle, it's enough for 20% of someone. The question is asking how many more bottles Hortex would need to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. 

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the total energy demand for 2300 people. Then, since each bottle covers 20% of someone's energy, I can find out how many bottles are needed for 100% of that demand. Finally, I'll subtract the number of bottles Hortex already produces each day to find out how many more they need to make.

Let me write this out step by step.

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people.**

   Each person needs 100% of their daily energy. So, for one person, it's 100% of their energy. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, for 2300 people, it's 2300 times 100% per person.

   So, total energy needed = 2300 people * 100% per person.

   But, that seems right. So, 2300 * 1.00.

   Let me compute that.

   2300 * 1.00 = 2300 bottles. Wait, that seems right. Because 100% is the same as 1, so 2300 *1 is 2300. So, total energy needed is 2300 bottles.

   Wait, that seems right. So, 2300 bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

2. **Now, each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy. So, how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the energy?**

   Each bottle covers 20%, so to cover 100%, we need how many 20% portions?

   So, 100% divided by 20% per bottle is 5 bottles per person.

   Wait, that seems right. So, each person needs 5 bottles to cover 100% of their energy.

   So, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is 2300 *5.

   Let me compute that.

   2300 *5 = 11500 bottles.

   So, Hortex needs 11500 bottles to satisfy 100% of the energy needs of 2300 people.

3. **Now, Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. How many more bottles does Hortex need to produce?**

   So, total needed is 11500 bottles, and they produce 4200 per day. So, the additional bottles needed would be 11500 - 4200.

   Let me compute that.

   11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles.

   So, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles to meet the energy demand.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, total energy needed for 2300 people at 100% is 2300 *1.00 = 2300 bottles. Wait, that seems right. Each person is 100%, so 2300 people *100% = 2300 bottles.

Each bottle covers 20%, so to get 100%, you need 5 bottles per person. So, 2300 *5 = 11500 bottles.

Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day. So, 11500 -4200 = 7300 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 7300 bottles.

But, that seems right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of percentages.

Each bottle covers 20% per person. So, per person, how many bottles do you need? 100% /20% =5 bottles per person.

So, 2300 people *5 bottles =11
