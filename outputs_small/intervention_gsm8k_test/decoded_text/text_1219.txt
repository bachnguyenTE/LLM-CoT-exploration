Q: John is a carpenter. For his friend Ali, he manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. How much does Ali have to pay John?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Ali has to pay John for his work. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

John is a carpenter. He made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. The question is asking how much Ali has to pay John in total.

Alright, so first, I need to calculate the total cost for the tables and the total cost for the roof frames separately, and then add them together to get the final amount.

Starting with the tables: John made 4 wooden tables, each costing $20. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So each table is $20. So to find the total cost for the tables, I need to multiply the number of tables by the cost per table.

Let me write that down:

Number of tables = 4
Cost per table = $20
Total cost for tables = Number of tables × Cost per table = 4 × $20

Wait, that seems right. So 4 times 20. Let me compute that. 4 times 20 is 80. So the total cost for the tables is $80.

Now, moving on to the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames, each costing $10. So similar to the tables, I need to multiply the number of roof frames by the cost per roof frame.

Number of roof frames = 2
Cost per roof frame = $10
Total cost for roof frames = Number of roof frames × Cost per roof frame = 2 × $10

Calculating that, 2 times 10 is 20. So the total cost for the roof frames is $20.

Now, to find the total amount Ali has to pay John, I need to add the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames together.

Total cost = Total cost for tables + Total cost for roof frames = $80 + $20

Adding those together, $80 plus $20 is $100.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

For the tables: 4 tables at $20 each. 4 times 20 is indeed 80. So that's correct.

For the roof frames: 2 frames at $10 each. 2 times 10 is 20. That's also correct.

Adding them together: 80 plus 20 is 100. Yep, that adds up.

So, Ali has to pay John a total of $100.

I don't think I made any errors here. The calculations seem straightforward, and I double-checked each step. So I'm confident that the total amount is $100.

**Final Answer**
Ali has to pay John \boxed{100} dollars.

John is a carpenter who made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tables:
\[
\text{Number of tables} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Cost per table} = \$20
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for tables} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the roof frames:
\[
\text{Number of roof frames} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Cost per roof frame} = \$10
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for roof frames} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Adding the total costs together gives:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \boxed{100} dollars.
