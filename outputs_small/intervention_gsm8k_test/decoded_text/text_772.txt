Q: Tatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of Tatiana's weekend she spends playing soccer. Let me break this down step by step.

First, Tatiana has two days: Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday, she has 7 hours, and on Sunday, 5 hours. So, in total, her weekend is 7 + 5 = 12 hours. That seems straightforward.

Now, she's dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. The problem says she reads for 3 hours. So, I can subtract that from the total to find out how much time she has left for soccer and video games.

Total time: 12 hours
Time spent reading: 3 hours
Remaining time: 12 - 3 = 9 hours

So, she has 9 hours left for soccer and video games. The problem states she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 1/3 of 9 hours.

1/3 of 9 hours: (1/3) * 9 = 3 hours

So, she spends 3 hours playing video games. Now, the remaining time must be spent on soccer. Let me subtract the video game time from the remaining time.

Remaining time after reading: 9 hours
Time spent on video games: 3 hours
Time left for soccer: 9 - 3 = 6 hours

So, she spends 6 hours playing soccer. Now, to find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, I need to compare the time she spends on soccer to the total weekend time.

Total weekend time: 12 hours
Time spent on soccer: 6 hours

Percentage = (Time spent on soccer / Total weekend time) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Percentage = (6 / 12) * 100

Calculating that:

6 divided by 12 is 0.5, and 0.5 times 100 is 50%.

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Total weekend time: 7 +5 =12 hours? Wait, that seems right. 7 on Saturday, 5 on Sunday, so 12 hours total? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
