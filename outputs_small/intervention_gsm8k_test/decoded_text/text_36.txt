Q: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Terry spends on buy yogurt over 30 days. Let me see, he eats 2 yogurt a day. Hmm, that means in 30 days, he'll eat 2 times 30, right? Let me calculate that. 2 times 30 is 60. So, Terry eats 60 yogurt in 30 days. 

Now, the yogurt are on sale: 4 for $5.00. Hmm, so I need to find out how many sets of 4 he can buy in 30 days. Since he eats 2 a day, over 30 days, he needs 60 yogurt. So, how many groups of 4 can I make from 60? Let me divide 60 by 4. 4 goes into 6 once with a remainder of 2, so that's 1 group of 4 and 2 left over. Wait, that seems right. So, he can buy 1 set of 4, which is 4 yogurt, and then he'll have 2 more yogurt to buy individually.

But, that seems right. So, 1 set of 4 yogurt costs $5.00, and then he needs 2 more. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total cost would be $5.0 for the 4 yogurt, plus the cost of 2 individual yogurt. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I need to know the price of one yogurt. The sale is 4 for $5.00, so each yogurt is 5.00 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 5.00 divided by 4 is 1.25. So, each yogurt is $1.25.

So, Terry buys 1 set of 4, which is $5.00, and then 2 more individual yogurt at 1.25 each. So, 2 times 1.25 is 2.50. So, adding that to the $5.00, that's 5.00 plus 2.50, which is 7.50. So, total cost is $7.50.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 2 yogurt a day for 30 days is 60 yogurt. On sale, 4 for $5.00. So, 60 divided by 4 is 15. So, 15 sets of 4 yogurt. Each set is $5.00, so 15 times 5.00 is 75.00. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 15 sets of 4 yogurt, each set is $5.00, so 15 times 5 is 75.00. So, that's $75.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, why did I get 7.50 earlier? Oh, because I was thinking of 1 set and 2 extra, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, 15 sets of 4 yogurt is 60 yogurt, which is exactly what Terry needs. So, 15 times 5 is 75.00. So, that's $75.00.
