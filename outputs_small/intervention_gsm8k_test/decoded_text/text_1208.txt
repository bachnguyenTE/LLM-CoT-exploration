Q: Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought the magazines. If she bought the magazines at $72, what is her profit?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. She bought them at $72, and I need to find her profit. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. So, profit = selling price - cost price. In this case, the cost price is $72, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I need to figure out what the selling price is first.

The problem says she sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Hmm, so is that 11/8 of the cost price or 11/8 of something else? Let me read that again. "Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought the magazines." So, it's 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, that would be 11/8 of the cost price.

Wait, that seems right. So, if she bought them at $72, then the selling price is 11/8 times $72. So, let me write that down.

Selling price = (11/8) * cost price
Selling price = (11/8) * 72

Wait, that seems right. So, 11/8 is 1.375, so 1.375 times 72. Let me calculate that.

First, 72 divided by 8 is 9, because 8 times 9 is 72. So, 11/8 of 72 is 9. Then, 11/8 of 72 is 9, so 11/8 of 72 is 9, so 11/8 of 72 is 9. So, 11/8 of 72 is 9 + 9 = 18? Wait, that seems right.
