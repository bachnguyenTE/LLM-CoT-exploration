Q: Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that had 50. If his father also gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, and each marble weighs 2kgs, calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. The store initially had 50 marbles. So, before any additional marbles, the total number of marbles in the store would be 50 plus 20. Let me write that down:

Store marbles initially = 50 + 20 = 72 marbles.

Wait, that seems right. 50 plus 20 is 72. So, the store had 72 marbles before anything else happened.

Next, Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Hmm, so he bought 20 marbles, and his father gave him 2/5 of that amount. Let me calculate how many marbles that is.

Father's marbles = (2/5) * 20.

Let me compute that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 20 is... 0.4 * 20. Let me do 0.4 * 20. 0.4 * 20 is 8.8. So, 8.8 marbles.

Wait, that seems right. 2/5 of 20 is 8.8 marbles. So, the father gave him 8.8 marbles.

Now, I need to add that to the store's total marbles. So, the total marbles now would be 72 (initial) plus 8.8 (from father). Let me add those together.

Total marbles = 72 + 8.8 = 80.8 marbles.

But, that seems right. 72 plus 8 is 80, and 0.8 is 0.8, so total is 80.8 marbles.

Now, each marble weighs 2 kgs. So, to find the total weight, I need to multiply the total number of marbles by 2 kgs.

Total weight = 80.8 marbles * 2 kgs/marble.

Let me compute that. 80 * 2 is 160, and 0.8 * 2 is 1.6. So, adding those together, 160 + 1.6 = 161.6 kgs.

So, the total weight of marbles in the store is 161.6 kgs.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, marbles bought: 20. Store had 50, so 70 marbles. Then father gave 2/5 of 20, which is 8. So, 70 + 8 is 78 marbles. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
