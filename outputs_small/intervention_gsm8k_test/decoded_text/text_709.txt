Q: An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about an ice cream factory that makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours. Hmm, so I need to find out how much chocolate ice cream they make per hour. To do that, I can divide the total quarts by the time taken. So, 100 quarts divided by 2 hours. Let me calculate that: 100 ÷ 2 is 50. So, they make 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream each hour. Got that.

Next, the problem mentions that they also make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours. I need to find out the rate for vanilla as well. So, similar to before, I'll divide the total quarts by the time. That's 50 quarts divided by 4 hours. Let me do that division: 50 ÷ 4 is 13.75. Hmm, that's 13.75 quarts per hour. I can also write that as a fraction, which is 50/4 or 13 3/4 quarts per hour. Okay, so that's the rate for vanilla.

Now, the question is asking how many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours. So, I need to calculate the total production for both chocolate and vanilla in 48 hours and then add them together.

Starting with chocolate: they make 50 quarts per hour. So, in 48 hours, that would be 50 quarts/hour multiplied by 48 hours. Let me compute that: 50 * 48. Hmm, 50 times 40 is 220, and 55 times 8 is 440. Wait, that seems right. So, 220 + 440 is 660. So, 50 * 48 is 660 quarts. Got that.

Now, for vanilla: they make 13.75 quarts per hour. So, in 48 hours, that would be 13.75 quarts/hour multiplied by 48 hours. Let me calculate that. 13.75 times 48. Hmm, 13 times 48 is 52, and 0.75 times 48 is 30. So, 52 + 30 is 82. Wait, that seems right. So, 13.75 * 48 is 82 quarts. Wait, that seems right. Let me check another way: 13.75 * 48. 13.75 is the same as 13 and 3/4. So, 13 * 48 is 52, and 3/4 * 48 is 36. So, 52 + 36 is 88. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
