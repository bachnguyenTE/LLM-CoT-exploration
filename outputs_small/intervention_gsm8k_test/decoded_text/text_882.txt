Q: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

Okay, so Kelly is grocery shopping, and she wants to make sure she has enough money in her budget. She has a total of $65 in her cart, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket. She's making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, 5 packs of bacon cost $10? That seems a bit confusing because 5 packs costing $10? That would mean each pack of bacon is $2.20, which is a bit expensive, but, that seems right. Let me check the rest of the problem.

She has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon. Okay, so if each pack of bacon is $2.20, then each packet of chicken is 2 times that, which is $4.40. So, 6 packets of chicken would cost 6 times $4.40. Let me calculate that: 6 * 4.40 is 26.40. So, $26.40 for the chicken.

Then, she has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each. So, 3 packs at $4 each is 3 * 4 = $12.00.

She also has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since strawberries are $4 each, half of that is $2 each. So, 7 packs of apples would cost 7 * 2 = $14.00.

Now, let me add up all these costs to see how much Kelly is spending in total.

First, the bacon: $10.00.

Then, the chicken: $26.40.

Then, the strawberries: $122.00.

Then, the apples: $14.00.

So, let me add them step by step.

Start with the bacon: $10.00.

Add the chicken: 10 + 26.40 = $36.40.

Add the strawberries: 36.40 + 12.40 = $38.80.

Wait, that seems right. 36.40 + 12.40 is 38.80.

Then, add the apples: 38.80 + 14.00 = $52.80.

So, total spending is $52.80.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Bacon: 5 packs cost $10.00. So, each pack is $2.00. Wait, that seems right. 5 * 2 = 10.

Chicken: 6 packets, each twice as much as bacon. So, each is 2 * 2 = $4.00. 6 * 4 = 24.00. Wait, that seems right. 6 * 4 is 24.

Strawberries: 3 packets at $4 each is 12.00.

Apples: 7 packets at half the price of strawberries. Half of 4 is 2. So, 7 * 2 = 14.00.

So, adding all these: 10 + 24 + 12 +14.

10 +24 is 35, 35 +12 is 47, 47 +14 is 61. So, total is $61.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, total spending is $61.00.

But, that seems right. So, her budget is $65.00.

So, how much money does she have left in her budget?

Subtract the total spending from the budget: 65.00 - 61.00 = 4.00.

So, she has $4.00 left.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

Bacon: 5 packs at $2 each is 10.00. Correct.

Chicken: 6 packets at $4 each is 24.00. Correct.

Strawberries: 3 at $4 each is 12.00. Correct.

Apples: 7 at $2 each is 14.00. Correct.

Total: 10 +24 is 34, 34 +12 is 46, 46 +14 is
