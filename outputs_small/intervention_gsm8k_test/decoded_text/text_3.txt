Q: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. I need to figure out how many total meters he runs in a week. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me break down the information given. James is running sprints, and he does this 3 times a week. Each time he does a sprint, he runs 60 meters. So, I guess I need to multiply the number of sprints he does each week by the distance of each sprint to get the total distance.

Wait, that seems right. So, if he does 3 sprints each week, and each sprint is 60 meters, then the total distance should be 3 multiplied by 60. Let me write that down to make it clearer.

Total meters = Number of sprints per week × Distance per sprint

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total meters = 3 × 60

Hmm, 3 times 60. Let me calculate that. 3 times 60 is... 3 times 60 is 180. So, does that mean he runs 180 meters a week?

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If he does 3 sprints, each 60 meters, then 3 times 60 is indeed 180. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 3 times 60. 60 is the same as 60, so it's the same calculation. 3 times 60 is 180, which is the same as 180. So, either way, it's 180 meters.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by breaking it down into smaller numbers. For example, 3 times 60 is the same as 3 times 60. If I do 3 times 60, that's like 3 times 60, which is 180. Yeah, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 3 times 60. 60 is 6 tens, so 3 times 6 tens is 18 tens, which is 180. So, that also gives me 180.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 times 60 is 180. So, 3 times 60 meters is 180 meters. So, that's the total distance he runs in a week.

Is there any chance I could have misread the question? Let me check again. He runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, 3 sprints each week, each sprint is 60 meters. So, 3 times 60 is 180. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if I thought about it as 3 times 60 meters, that's 180 meters. So, yeah, that's consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 sprints, each 60 meters, so 3 times 60 is 180. So, 180 meters a week.

I think that's the answer. So, the total meters he runs a week is 180 meters.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think about it in another way. If he does 3 sprints, each 60 meters, so each sprint is 60 meters. So, 60 meters plus 60 meters plus 60 meters. So, 60 plus 60 is 120, plus another 60 is 180. So, that's 180 meters. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 180 meters.

**Final Answer**
The total meters James runs a week is \boxed{180}.
</think>

James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. To find the total distance he runs in a week, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint:

\[
\text{Total meters} = 3 \times 60 = 180
\]

Thus, the total meters James runs a week is \boxed{180}.
