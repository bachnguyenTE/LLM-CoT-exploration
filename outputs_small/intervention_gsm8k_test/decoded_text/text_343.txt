Q: In his training as a professional athlete, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much distance Tyson covers in June if he takes his coach's advice. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. Wait, that seems right. So, 5000 meters per day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. Hmm, okay, so I need to calculate 1/5 times more than 5000 meters.

Let me think about what "1/5 times more" means. If something increases by 1/5 times, that means it's multiplied by 1 + 1/5, which is 6/5. So, the new distance per day would be 5000 meters multiplied by 6/5.

Let me write that down:

New distance per day = 5000 * (6/5)

Hmm, let me compute that. 5000 divided by 5 is 1000, right? Because 5 times 1000 is 5500. Wait, that seems right. So, 5500 divided by 5 is 1100. So, 5500 * (6/5) is 1100 * 6.

Wait, that seems right. So, 1100 times 6. Let me compute that. 1000 times 6 is 6000, and 100 times 6 is 600, so 6000 + 600 is 7200. So, 11000 *6 is 6660? Wait, that seems right.
