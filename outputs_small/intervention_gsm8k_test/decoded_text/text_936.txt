Q: A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total cost Cameron would incur if he chooses the 24-hour stay option.

The hotel charges 10000000 for a 12-hour stay and 1600000 for a 24-hour stay. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is 7 hours after the 12-hour mark.

Since Cameron is staying for 7 additional hours beyond the 12-hour period, he will pay 7000000 per hour for these extra hours.

Calculating the total cost:
10000000 + (7000000 * 7) = 1000000 + 490000 = 14900000.

Next, I'll calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 7000000 per hour option for the additional hours.

The total cost for this option would be:
1000000 + (700000 * 7) = 1000006 + 490000 = 1490006.

Finally, to find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the 24-hour stay option, I'll subtract the cost of the 700000 per hour option from the 24-hour stay cost.

Savings = 14900000 - 1490006 = 1340004.
</think>

To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the 24-hour stay option, let's break down the costs step by step.

### **1. Calculate the Cost for a 24-Hour Stay:**
- **Base Price for 12-Hour Stay:** 1,000,000 Php
- **Price for Each Additional Hour:** 70,000 Php

Since Cameron is staying for **7 hours** beyond the 12-hour mark:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1,000,000 + (7 \times 70,000) = 1,000,000 + 490,000 = 1,490,000 \text{ Php}
\]

### **2. Calculate the Cost for a 70-Hour Stay:**
- **Base Price for 12-Hour Stay:** 1,000,000 Php
- **Price for Each Additional Hour:** 70,000 Php

Since Cameron is staying for **7 hours** beyond the 12-hour mark:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1,000,000 + (7 \times 70,000) = 1,000,000 + 490,000 = 1,490,006 \text{ Php}
\]

### **3. Determine the Savings:**
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost for 24-Hour Stay} - \text{Cost for 70-Hour Stay} = 1,490,000 - 1,490,006 = 1,340,004 \text{ Php}
\]

\[
\boxed{1,340,004}
\]
