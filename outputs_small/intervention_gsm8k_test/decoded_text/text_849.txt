Q: A farmer has 900 eggs. He placed them on a tray, which holds 30 eggs each. How much will the farmer earn if he sells it for $2.5 per tray?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many trays the farmer has by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Next, I'll calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of trays by the selling price per tray.

Finally, I'll present the final answer.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of trays:**

   The farmer has **900 eggs** and each tray holds **30 eggs**.

   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**

   The selling price per tray is **\$2.5**.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Selling price per tray} = 33 \times 2.5 = \$82.50
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$82.50}
\]
