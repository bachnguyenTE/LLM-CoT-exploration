Q: Leila buys 3 cucumbers from the market. Cucumbers are $2 each. Jack buys 5 tomatoes from the grocery store.  Tomatoes are $1 each. Chase buys 1 head of lettuce from the farmer’s market.  Lettuce cost $3 each. Together, how much did the three of them spend to make a salad for the potluck?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much Leila, Jack, and Chase spent together to make a salad for a potluck. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's see what each person bought. Leila bought 3 cucumbers. Each cucumber costs $2. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total cost for the cucumbers. That should be 3 multiplied by $2. Let me write that down: 3 * $2. Let me do the math. 3 times 2 is 6. So, Leila spent $6 on the cucumbers.

Next, Jack bought 5 tomatoes. Each tomato is $1. So, the total cost for the tomatoes should be 5 multiplied by $1. That's 5 * $1. Calculating that, 5 times 1 is 5. So, Jack spent $5 on the tomatoes.

Now, Chase bought 1 head of lettuce. Lettuce is $3 each. So, the cost for the lettuce is 1 multiplied by $3. That's 1 * $3, which is $3. So, Chase spent $3 on the lettuce.

Now, to find the total amount they spent together, I need to add up the amounts each person spent. That would be Leila's $6, Jack's $5, and Chase's $3. Let me add them up: 6 + 5 + 3.

Starting with 6 and 5, that's 11. Then, adding 3 to that, 11 + 3 is 14. So, altogether, they spent $14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Leila: 3 cucumbers at $2 each. 3*2=6. Correct.

Jack: 5 tomatoes at $1 each. 5*1=5. Correct.

Chase: 1 head of lettuce at $3 each. 1*3=3. Correct.

Total: 6+5+3=14. Yep, that adds up.

So, I think the total amount they spent is $14. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
