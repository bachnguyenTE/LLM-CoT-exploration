Q: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade at their lemonade stand. Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade at their lemonade stand. Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three people: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell. Together, they sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. The other two, Micah and Mitchell, sold an equal number of glasses. So, I need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.

Alright, so let's break this down. The total number of glasses sold is 32. Julie sold 14, so that means the remaining glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together would be 32 minus 14. Let me write that down:

Total glasses sold = 32
Glasses sold by Julie = 14
Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together = 32 - 14

Calculating that, 32 minus 14 is... let me do the subtraction. 32 minus 10 is 31, minus 4 more is 28. Wait, that seems right. So, 32 - 14 = 18. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 14 plus 18 is 32, so that adds up. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses.

Now, the problem says that the boys sold an equal number of glasses. Hmm, wait, that seems right. So, does that mean both Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses? So, each of them sold the same number, and together they sold 18 glasses.

So, if Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number, then each of them sold half of 18 glasses. So, 18 divided by 2 is 9. So, each of them sold 9 glasses.

Wait, that seems right. So, Micah sold 9 glasses, and Mitchell sold 9 glasses. So, each of them sold 9.

So, now, the question is, how many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah? So, Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 9 glasses. So, how many more? Hmm, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
