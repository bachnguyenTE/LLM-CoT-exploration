Q: A company spends $15000 on advertising for a year, and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year.  What's the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where a company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. Then, they spend a third of that amount on advertising for another year. I need to find the total amount they spent on advertising over the two years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The company spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year. Then, in the second year, they spend a third of that amount. So, I need to calculate both amounts and add them together to get the total expenditure.

Alright, so the first part is straightforward: $15,0000. I can write that as $15,000. Wait, that seems right. So, $15,000 is the amount for the first year.

Now, for the second year, they spend a third of that amount. So, I need to calculate a third of $15,000. Hmm, how do I do that? Well, a third is like dividing by 3, right? So, I can write this as:

Amount spent in second year = (1/3) * $15,000

Let me compute that. So, 15,000 divided by 3. Let me do the division step by step.

15,000 divided by 3. Let me write it out:

3 | 15,000

3 goes into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15, subtract, bring down the next digit, which is 0. 3 goes into 0 zero times. So, we have 5.000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15 divided by 3 is 5, and then 0 divided by 3 is 0, and 0 divided by 3 is 0. So, the result is 5,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15,000 divided by 3 is 5,000. So, the company spends $5,000 on advertising in the second year.

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, I need to add the first year's expenditure and the second year's expenditure together.

So, total expenditure = $15,000 + $5,000

Let me add those two amounts. 15,000 plus 5,000 is 20,000.

Wait, that seems right. So, 15,000 plus 5,000 is 20,000.

So, the total amount spent on advertising over the two years is $20,000.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first year is $15,000. A third of that is $5,000. Adding them together gives $20,000. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 15,000 plus a third of 15,000. So, 15,000 times (1 + 1/3) which is 15,000 times 4/3. Let me compute that.

15,000 multiplied by 4 is 60,000. Then, 60,000 divided by 3 is 20,000. So, that also gives me the same result. So, that's another way to confirm it.

Therefore, I can be confident that the total amount spent on advertising over the two years is $20,000.

**Final Answer**
The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \boxed{200000} dollars.

The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. In the second year, they spend a third of that amount, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent in second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = 5,000
\]

To find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts from both years:

\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 15,0000 + 5,000 = 20,000
\]

Thus, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \boxed{220000} dollars.
