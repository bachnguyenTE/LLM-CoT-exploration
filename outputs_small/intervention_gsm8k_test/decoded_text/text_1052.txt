Q: Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train. If 80 more people descended at the third station, calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

Okay, so I have this problem about Romeo boarding a train, and I need to figure out the total number of people on the train after three stops. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Romeo boards a train with 120 people. So, initially, the train has 120 people on it. That seems straightforward.

Now, at the first stop, 20 more people board the train. Hmm, okay, so I need to add those 20 to the current number of passengers. So, starting from 120, adding 20. Let me write that down:

120 (initial number) + 20 (boarding at first stop) = ?

Wait, that seems right. 120 plus 20 is 142. So, after the first stop, there are 142 people on the train.

Moving on to the second stop. It says that at the second stop, 50 people descended from the train while twice that number boarded the train. Hmm, okay, so let me parse that.

So, 50 people descended. That's 50, which is 50. Then, twice that number boarded the train. Twice 50 is 110. So, 110 people boarded the train at the second stop.

Wait, that seems right. So, at the second stop, 50 people got off, and 110 people got on. So, the net change at the second stop is 110 (boarding) minus 50 (dismissing). So, 110 net gain.

So, starting from 142 after the first stop, we subtract 50 and add 110 at the second stop.

Let me calculate that:

142 (after first stop) - 50 (dismissing) + 110 (boarding) = ?

142 minus 50 is 92, and 92 plus 110 is 203. So, after the second stop, there are 203 people on the train.

Now, moving on to the third stop. It says that 80 more people descended at the third station. So, 80 people got off. So, we need to subtract 80 from the current number of passengers.

So, starting from 203 after the second stop, subtract 80.

203 - 80 = ?

203 minus 80 is 123. So, after the third stop, there are 123 people on the train.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First stop: 120 + 20 = 142. Correct.

Second stop: 142 - 50 = 92, then 92 + 110 = 202. Wait, that seems right. 142 minus 50 is 92, plus 110 is 202. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 142 minus 50 is 92, plus 110 is 202. So, 202 after the second stop.

Third stop: 202 minus 80 is 122. Wait, that seems right. 202 minus 80 is 122. Wait, that seems right. 202 minus 80 is 122.

Wait, that seems right. So, 122 is the final number.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 122.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just go through it again.

Start: 120.

First stop: +20 = 142.

Second stop: -50 (dismissing) +110 (boarding) = 142 -50=92, 92+110=202.

Third stop: -80=202-80=122.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the final answer is 122.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of people on the train at the final stop is \boxed{122}.
</think>

Romeo boards a train with 120 people. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, so the number of passengers becomes:

\[ 120 + 20 = 142 \]

At the second stop, 50
