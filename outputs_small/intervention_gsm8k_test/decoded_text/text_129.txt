Q: A hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Okay, so I have this problem about a hospital's profit from patient visits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. I need to find out how much profit the hospital makes from these visits.

Hmm, profit usually means total revenue minus total costs. So, I think I need to calculate both the total revenue the hospital makes from all the patient visits and the total costs they incur for these visits. Then, subtract the costs from the revenue to get the profit.

Let me break it down. 

First, let's find the total revenue. The hospital charges each patient $200 an hour. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if each patient is seen for 24 minutes, and the hospital charges $200 an hour, how much does each patient contribute to the revenue?

Wait, that seems right. So, if each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 24/60 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. So, each patient is charged for 0.4 hours at $200 per hour. So, the revenue per patient is 0.4 * 200.

Let me calculate that. 0.4 times 200. 0.4 * 200 is 80. So, each patient brings in $80. 

Wait, that seems right. So, each patient is $80. So, for 550 patients a day, the total revenue would be 550 * 80.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that. 550 * 80. Hmm, 500 * 80 is 40,000, and 50 *80 is 4,000. So, total is 44,000. So, total revenue is $44,000 a day.

Wait, that seems right. So, total revenue is $44,000 a day.

Now, let's calculate the total costs. The doctors charge $150 an hour. So, each doctor is working for 24 minutes, right? So, how much does each doctor charge per patient?

So, the doctors charge $150 an hour, which is $150 per 60 minutes. So, per minute, that's $150 / 60 = $2.50 per minute.

So, each patient is seen for 24 minutes, so the cost per patient is 24 * 2.50.

Let me compute that. 24 * 2.50. 24 * 2 is 48, and 24 * 0.50 is 12, so total is 48 + 12 = 60. So, each patient costs the hospital $60.

Wait, that seems right. So, each patient costs $60. So, for 550 patients, the total cost is 550 * 60.

Let me compute that. 500 * 60 is 30,000, and 50 *60 is 3,000. So, total cost is 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000.

So, total cost is $33,000 a day.

Therefore, the profit is total revenue minus total cost, which is 44,000 - 33,000.

Let me compute that. 44,000 - 33,000 is 11,000.

So, the profit is $11,000 a day.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, revenue per patient: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 0.4 * 200 = 80. So, each patient is $80. 550 patients: 550 *80. Let me compute 550 *80 first. 500 *80 is 44,000. Then, 5 *80 is 4,000. So, total is 44,000 + 4,000 = 48,000. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So
