Q: Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?

First, I need to calculate the net pay for both jobs by considering the respective tax rates and deductions.

For Job A:
- The annual salary is $15,0000 (which is $15,0000, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year is $30,000, and with a 20% tax rate, the total tax is $6,000. So, the net pay is $30,00 minus $6,000, which equals $24,000.

For Job B:
- The annual salary is $42,000. The property tax is $6,000. After deducting the property tax, the net income is $42,000 minus $6,000, which equals $36,000. Then, applying a 10% tax rate on the net income, the tax is $3,600. Subtracting this from the net income, the final net pay is $36,000 minus $3,600, which equals $32,400.

Comparing the two net pays, Job B offers a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

To determine which job offers a higher net pay, we'll calculate the net pay for both jobs by considering the respective tax rates and deductions.

### **Job A:**
- **Annual Salary:** \$15/hour × 2000 hours = **\$30,000**
- **Tax Rate:** 20%
- **Total Tax:** \$30,000 × 20% = **\$6,000**
- **Net Pay:** \$30,000 - \$6,000 = **\$24,000**

### **Job B:**
- **Annual Salary:** \$42,000
- **Property Tax:** \$6,000
- **Net Income After Property Tax:** \$42,000 - \$6,000 = **\$36,000**
- **Tax Rate:** 10%
- **Total Tax:** \$36,000 × 10% = **\$3,600**
- **Net Pay:** \$36,000 - \$3,600 = **\$32,400**

### **Comparison:**
- **Job A Net Pay:** **\$24,000**
- **Job B Net Pay:** **\$32,400**

**Conclusion:**  
**Job B** offers a higher net pay of **\$32,400** compared to **Job A's** net pay of **\$24,000**.

\boxed{\$32,400}
