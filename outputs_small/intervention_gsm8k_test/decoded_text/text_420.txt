Q: To fund his store, Mr. Josue solicited money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second company gave him twice as much. If he initially had $5000 in capital, how much capital does he have now?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Mr. Josue is trying to fund his store by getting money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much as the first. He started with $5000 in capital. I need to figure out how much capital he has now. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mr. Josue has two sources of funding: the first bank and the second bank. The first bank gives him $4000, and the second bank gives him twice that amount. So, I need to calculate how much the second bank gave him and then add that to the first bank's contribution. After that, I can add that total to his initial capital of $5000 to find out his current capital.

Alright, let's start with the first part: the first bank gave him $4000. Wait, that seems right. So, $4000 is the amount from the first bank. Now, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. So, if the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave 2 times that amount. Let me write that down.

Amount from first bank: $4000.

Amount from second bank: 2 × $4000.

Let me compute that. 2 times 4000. Hmm, 2 × 4000 is 8000. So, the second bank gave him $8000.

Now, to find the total amount he received from fund his store, I need to add the amounts from both banks. So, $4000 + $8000.

Let me add those together. 4000 + 8000. Hmm, 4000 + 8000. Let me break it down: 4000 + 8000 is 12000, and then plus 000 is still 12000. So, the total amount he received from both banks is $12000.

Wait, that seems right. So, $4000 from the first bank and $8000 from the second bank, totaling $12000.

Now, he started with $5000 in capital. So, his initial capital was $5000. Now, he received $12000 from the banks. So, to find his current capital, I need to add the $12000 to his initial $5000.

So, $5000 + $12000. Let me compute that. 5000 + 12000. That's straightforward. 5000 + 12000 is 17000. So, his current capital is $17000.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First bank: $4000.

Second bank: twice that, so 2 × 4000 = 8000.

Total from banks: 4000 + 8000 = 12000.

Initial capital: 5000.

Total capital now: 5000 + 12000 = 17000.

Yes, that seems correct. So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. If he had $5000 and then got $12000, that's a significant increase. So, 5000 + 12000 is indeed 17000. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as adding the two amounts together first. So, 4000 + 8000 is 12000, and then adding 5000 gives 17000. Yeah, that's consistent.

So, I think that's the correct answer. He now has $17000 in capital.

**Final Answer**
Mr. Josue now has \boxed{17000} dollars in capital.

Mr. Josue solicited money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. 

First, we calculate the amount given by the second bank:
\[
2 \times 4000 = 8000
\]

Next, we find the total amount received from both banks:
\[
