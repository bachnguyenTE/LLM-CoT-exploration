Q: Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?

Okay, so I have this problem about Elvis and his monthly savings target. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, Elvis has a target of $1125 each month. That's his total savings goal for the month. Now, in April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Hmm, so he's splitting his savings between two parts: the first half of April and the second half. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if I think about April, it has 30 days, right? So, the first half would be the first 15 days, and the second half would be the last 15 days. So, 15 days in each half. 

He wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Let me denote the amount he saves each day in the first half as, say, x dollars. Then, in the second half, he saves twice that amount each day, which would be 2x dollars per day. 

So, for the first 15 days, he saves x dollars each day. So, the total savings for the first half would be 15 times x, which is 15x. Similarly, for the second half, he saves 2x dollars each day, so that's 15 times 2x, which is 30x. Wait, that seems right. So, 15x and 30x? Wait, that seems right. 

So, the total savings for the month would be the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half. So, that would be 15x + 30x. Let me compute that. 15x + 30x is 45x. So, the total savings is 45x. 

But, that seems right. So, 45x equals his total savings target, which is $1125. So, 45x = 1125. So, to find x, we can divide both sides by 45. 

So, x = 1125 / 45. Let me compute that. 45 goes into 1125 how many times? 45 times 20 is 900, subtract that from 1125, we get 225. 45 goes into 225 five times because 45 times 5 is 225. So, 20 + 5 is 25. So, x is 25. 

So, x is 25 dollars. That means he saves $25 each day in the first half. Then, in the second half, he saves twice that amount, which is 2 times 25, which is 50. So, he saves $50 each day in the second half. 

Let me just double-check that. So, in the first half, 15 days times $25 is 15*25. 10*25 is 250, 5*25 is 125, so 250 + 125 is 375. Then, in the second half, 15 days times $50 is 15*50. 10*50 is 500, 5*50 is 250, so 500 + 250 is 750. Then, 375 + 750 is 1125, which matches his target. So, that seems correct. 

So, the amount he has to save each day in the second half is $50. 

**Final Answer**
The amount Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month is \boxed{50} dollars.

Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. 

First, we note that April has 30 days in each half (first 15 days and last 15 days). Let \( x \) be the amount saved each day in the first half. Then, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

The total savings for the first half is \( 15x \) and for the second half is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \). The total savings for the month is the sum of these two amounts:

\[
15x + 30x = 45x
\]

Given that the total savings target is $112
