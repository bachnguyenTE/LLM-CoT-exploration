Q: Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes.  In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.  How many total points did he score?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Mike is playing ping pong, and he plays for a total of 40 minutes. The question is asking how many points he scored in total. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, it says that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. That seems straightforward. So, in 20 minutes, he has 4 points. Now, the second part says that in the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. Wait, that seems right. So, in the second half of his 40-minute session, he scores 25% more than he did in the first half.

Let me make sure I understand this correctly. The first 20 minutes: 4 points. The second 20 minutes: 25% more than 4 points. So, I need to calculate 25% of 4 points and then add that to the original 4 points to get the total points for the second half. Then, I can add both halves together to get the total points.

Alright, let's do the math. 25% of 4 points. To find 25% of 4, I can convert 25% to a decimal, which is 0.25. Then, multiply 4 by 0.25. Let me calculate that: 4 * 0.25. Hmm, 4 times 0 is 4, and 4 times 0.25 is 1, so 4 + 1 is 5. Wait, that seems right. 25% of 4 is 1. So, 4 points plus 1 point is 5 points in the second half.

So, in the first half, he scored 4 points, and in the second half, he scored 5 points. To find the total points, I just add those two together: 4 + 5. That equals 9 points.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 25% more than 4 is 5, so 4 + 5 is 9. Yeah, that makes sense. So, Mike scored a total of 9 points in 40 minutes.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using fractions? 25% is the same as 1/4, right? So, 1/4 of 4 is 1. So, adding that to 4 gives 5. Then, 4 + 5 is 9. Yeah, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as multiplying. If he scores 25% more, that's like multiplying by 1.25. So, 4 * 1.25 is 5. So, same answer. So, that seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. So, 4 points in the first half, 5 points in the second half, total of 9 points. So, the answer is 9.

But, that seems right. Let me just visualize it. So, 40 minutes total, 20 minutes each half. First half: 4 points. Second half: 25% more, so 4 + 1 = 5. So, 4 + 5 is 9. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to realize that 25% more is an increase, so I had to calculate that increase and add it to the original amount. So, 25% of 4 is 1, so 4 + 1 is 5. Then, adding both halves, 4 + 5 is 9. So, the total points Mike scored are 9.

I think that's solid. I don't see any other way to interpret the question. It's straightforward: two halves, each 20 minutes, scoring 4 and 25% more respectively. So, 4 + 5 is 9. Yeah, that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total points Mike scored are \boxed{9}.

Mike plays ping pong for a total of 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first half.

First, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[
25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
\]
So, in the second half, Mike scores:
\[
4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
\]

Adding the points from both halves:
\[
4 + 5 = 9
\]

Thus, the total points Mike scored are
