Q: A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Sylvie and her salary increases at a company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the company pays each employee $600 every month. That's the initial salary. Now, the company has a policy where they increase the salaries of employees who have stayed for five years by 10% of the initial salary each year. Hmm, so that means every year, starting from the sixth year, their salary increases by 10% of $600. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the initial salary is $600, and each year, they add 10% of that to the salary. So, each year, the salary increases by 0.60 dollars, right? Because 10% of 600 is 0.60. So, each year, the salary goes up by $0.60. 

But, that seems right. Let me check: 10% of 600 is 0.60, yes. So, each year, the salary increases by $0.60. So, starting from $600, after one year, it would be 600 + 60 = 666. After two years, it would be 666 + 66 = 732, and so on. 

But, that seems right. So, the salary increases by $0.60 each year. So, the formula for Sylvie's salary after n years would be 600 + 0.60 * n. 

Wait, that seems right. So, if she has been with the company for five years, her salary would be 600 + 0.60 * 5. Let me calculate that: 0.60 * 5 is 3.00, so 600 + 3.00 is 603.00. So, her salary after five years is $603.00. 

But, that seems right. So, the company is increasing the salary by 10% of the initial salary each year, which is $600, so 10% of 600 is 60. So, each year, the salary increases by $60. So, that's consistent with the 0.60 per year. So, 0.60 is 10% of 600, which is 60. So, that's correct. 

So, the formula is correct. So, her salary after n years is 600 + 60n. So, after five years, it's 600 + 60*5 = 600 + 300 = 900? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
