Q: Sophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?

Okay, so Sophia is thinking about a road trip, and she wants to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, from the problem, I know that Sophia has already driven 100 miles since her last fill-up. She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. Her car's owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons. So, I need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. She drove 100 miles and then added 4 gallons to fill up her tank. That means that 4 gallons of gas was used to travel those 100 miles. So, maybe I can find out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas.

If 4 gallons get her 100 miles, then the number of miles per gallon would be 100 divided by 4. Let me write that down:

Miles per gallon = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Wait, that seems right. 4 gallons for 100 miles, so 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, 25 miles per gallon. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, if her car gets 25 miles per gallon, and her tank can hold 12 gallons, then the total distance she can drive on a full tank would be 25 miles per gallon multiplied by 12 gallons.

Let me calculate that:

Total miles = 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. She drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons, so 100 miles on 4 gallons is 25 mpg. Then, 25 mpg times 12 gallons is 300 miles. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think about it as a proportion. If 4 gallons get her 100 miles, then 1 gallon gets her 25 miles, so 12 gallons get her 50 miles, 3 gallons get her 75 miles, and so on. But, that seems right. So, 12 gallons would be 125 * 12, which is 300 miles.

Wait, that seems right. So, 12 gallons * 25 miles per gallon is 300 miles. Yeah, that's correct.

So, I think the answer is 300 miles.

**Final Answer**
Sophia can drive \boxed{300} miles on a single tank of gas.

Sophia has driven 100 miles and needed 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank. Her car's owner's manual indicates the tank holds 12 gallons. 

First, we calculate the miles per gallon (mpg):
\[
\text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Next, we determine how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[
\text{Total miles} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, Sophia can drive \boxed{300} miles on a single tank of gas.
