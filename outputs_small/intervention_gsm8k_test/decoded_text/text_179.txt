Q: Lloyd earns $10 an hour on Math tutoring.  He tutored 5 hours for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. How much did he earn for the first two weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks of tutoring. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that Lloyd earns $10 per hour. That's straightforward. So, for each hour he tutors, he gets $10. Now, he tutored for two weeks. In the first week, he worked 5 hours, and in the second week, he worked 8 hours. I need to calculate his total earnings from these two weeks.

Hmm, let me think. Since he earns the same rate every week, I can calculate his earnings for each week separately and then add them together. That makes sense because each week is independent, right? So, for the first week, he worked 5 hours. If he makes $10 per hour, then his earnings for the first week would be 5 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. Let me write that down:

First week earnings = 5 hours * $10/hour

Calculating that, 5 times 10 is 50, so that's $50 for the first week.

Now, moving on to the second week. He worked 8 hours. Using the same rate, his earnings for the second week would be 8 hours multiplied by $10 per hour. Let me write that:

Second week earnings = 8 hours * $10/hour

Calculating that, 8 times 10 is 80, so that's $80 for the second week.

Wait, that seems right. So, to find the total earnings for the first two weeks, I need to add the earnings from the first week and the second week together. So, that would be:

Total earnings = First week earnings + Second week earnings
Total earnings = $50 + $80

Adding those together, 50 plus 80 is 130. So, that should be $130.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First week: 5 hours * $10 = $50. That seems correct. Second week: 8 hours * $10 = $80. Adding them together: 50 + 80. Hmm, 50 plus 80. Let me add the tens and the units separately. 50 is 5 tens and 0 units, and 80 is 8 tens and 0 units. So, 5 tens plus 8 tens is 13 tens, which is $130, and 0 units plus 0 units is 0. So, total is $130. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
