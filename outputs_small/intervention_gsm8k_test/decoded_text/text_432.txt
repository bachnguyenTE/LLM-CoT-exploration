Q: Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about four princes and the number of dragons they each slew. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem says Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his sword. That seems straightforward. So, Thaddeus: 100 dragons. Got that.

Next, Prince Arthur uses a spear and sries three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Hmm, okay. So, if Thaddeus sries 100 dragons, Arthur sries three quarters of that. Let me write that down. Three quarters of 100. So, 3/4 * 100. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 4 is 25, right? Because 4 times 25 is 100. So, 3 times 25 is 75. So, Arthur sries 75 dragons. Okay, that makes sense.

Then, Prince Walter uses a rusty iron axe and sries twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, if Arthur sries 75 dragons, Walter sries twice that. So, 2 * 75. Let me do that. 2 times 70 is 140, and 2 times 5 is 10, so 140 + 10 is 150. So, Walter sries 150 dragons. Got it.

Now, Prince Bruce forgets his sword at home and sries one-fifth as many dragons as Walter. So, one-fifth of 150. Let me calculate that. 150 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 15 three times, so 5 goes into 150 thirty times. So, 150 divided by 5 is 30. So, Bruce sries 30 dragons. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

So, Thaddeus: 100 dragons. Arthur: 3/4 of 100 is 75. Walter: twice 75 is 150. Bruce: 1/5 of 150 is 30. Yeah, that seems consistent.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Thaddeus: 100, Arthur: 75, Walter: 150, Bruce: 30. So, 100, 75, 150, 30. Each subsequent one is 3/4, 2, and 1/5 of the previous. So, 100 to 75 is 3/4, 75 to 150 is 2, 150 to 30 is 1/5. Yeah, that seems to fit.

So, the question is asking how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain. So, the answer is 30. That seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just think if there's any chance I misread the problem. It says Prince Bruce sries one-fifth as many dragons as Walter. So, if Walter sries 150, one-fifth is 30. So, yes, 30. So, I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step follows logically from the previous one. Thaddeus: 100, Arthur: 75, Walter: 150, Bruce: 30. So, 30 is the answer.

**Final Answer**
Prince Bruce has slain \boxed{30} dragons.

Prince Thaddeus sries 100 dragons. Prince Arthur sries three quarters of that, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Prince Walter sries twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:

\[
2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Prince Bruce sries one-fifth as many dragons as Walter, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, Prince Bruce has slain \boxed{30} dragons.
