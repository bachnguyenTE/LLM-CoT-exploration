Q: Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?

Okay, so I have this problem here where Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than the window. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mark's window is 20 feet high, so that's 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet, and each day it doubles in height. So, every day, the height of the beanstalk becomes twice what it was the day before. I need to find out after how many days the beanstalk will be taller than 20 feet.

Alright, so let's break this down. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet. Each day, it doubles. So, on day 1, it's 4 feet. On day 2, it's 8 feet. Day 3, 16 feet. Day 4, 32 feet. Wait, that seems right. So, on day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet. So, is the answer 4 days?

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. Starting at 4 feet:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

So, on day 3, it's 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet. So, is the answer 3 days? Or is it 4 days?

Wait, that seems right. So, on day 3, it's 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet. So, the answer is 3 days.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. So, starting at day 0, which is 4 feet. Then, each day, it's doubling. So, the height on day n is 4 * 2^n. Wait, that seems right. So, on day 0, it's 4 feet. On day 1, 8, day2,16, day3,32, day4,64, etc.

Wait, that seems right. So, the height on day n is 4 * 2^n. So, we need to find the smallest n such that 4 * 2^n > 20.

So, let's set up the inequality: 4 * 2^n > 20.

Divide both sides by 4: 2^n > 5.

So, 2^n > 5. So, what is n? Let's see.

2^2 = 4, which is less than 5.

2^3 = 8, which is greater than 5.

So, n=3. So, on day 3, the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 3 days.

But, that seems right. So, the answer is 3 days.
