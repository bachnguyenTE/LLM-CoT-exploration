Q: Martha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of people invited to the party. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, the total number of invited people is 2 times 6 plus 3 times 4, which equals 12 plus 12, totaling 24 people.

Next, I need to account for the 8 people who couldn't attend due to illness. Subtracting these from the total invited gives 24 minus 8, which equals 16 people.

Then, I have to consider the 1/4 of the 8 people who had previous commitments. Calculating 1/4 of 8 gives 2 people.

Finally, subtracting these 2 people from the 16 who couldn't attend due to illness results in 16 minus 2, which equals 14 people who attended the party.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people attended Martha's Christmas party.

1. **Total Number of People Invited:**
   - Martha invited:
     - 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
     - 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people
   - **Total invited:** \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

2. **People Who Couldn't Attend Due to Illness:**
   - **Number of people who couldn't attend:** 8 people

3. **People with Previous Commitments:**
   - **Fraction of people with previous commitments:** \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8
   - **Calculation:** \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

4. **Total Number of People Who Couldn't Attend (Both Illness and Commitments):**
   - **Total:** \(8 + 2 = 10\) people

5. **Number of People Who Showed Up:**
   - **Total invited:** 24 people
   - **Subtract those who couldn't attend:** \(24 - 10 = 14\) people

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
