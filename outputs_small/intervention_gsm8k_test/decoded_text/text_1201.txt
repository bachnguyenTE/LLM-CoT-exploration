Q: There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about fish in a tank. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 66 fish in the tank. Hmm, okay, that's straightforward. Then it says one-third of the fish have red stripes. So, I need to find out how many fish that is. 

Alright, so one-third of 66. Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 3 is 22. So, 22 fish have red stripes. Got that down. 

Now, the problem also mentions that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Hmm, so after accounting for the red-striped fish, the rest are the ones with blue stripes. I need to figure out how many fish are left after taking out the red ones and then find 5/11 of that remaining number.

Wait, that seems right. So, first, total fish: 66. Red-striped: 22. So, remaining fish would be 66 minus 22. Let me do that subtraction. 66 minus 22 is 44. So, there are 44 fish left.

Now, of these 44 remaining fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. So, I need to calculate 5/11 of 44. Hmm, how do I do that? Well, 5/111 is a fraction, so I can multiply 44 by 5 and then divide by 11, or maybe simplify it first.

Let me think. 44 divided by 11 is 4, right? Because 11 times 4 is 44. So, 44 divided by 11 is 44. So, 5/111 of 44 is 5 times 4, which is 20. So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Wait, that seems right. So, 22 red-striped and 20 blue-striped. But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Total fish: 66. Red: 22, blue: 20. So, 22 plus 20 is 42. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 66 minus 22 minus 20 is 26. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
