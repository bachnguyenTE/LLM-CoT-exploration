Q: Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. How many miles did Alisa and Stanley bike in total?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Alisa and Stanley are biking, and I need to figure out how many miles they biked in total. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem says Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. Hmm, okay, so that's a speed multiplied by time, which should give me the distance she covered. I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time, so the formula is d = s * t. So, for Alisa, her speed is 12 mph, and she biked for 4.5 hours. So, I can calculate her distance by multiplying 12 by 4.5. Let me write that down: 12 * 4.5. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me do the multiplication. 12 times 4 is 48, and 12 times 0.5 is 6, so adding those together, 48 + 6 is 54. So, Alisa biked 54 miles. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to Stanley. The problem states that Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Wait, that seems right. So, similar to Alisa, I can use the same formula here. His speed is 10 mph, and he biked for 2.5 hours. So, his distance would be 10 multiplied by 2.5. Let me calculate that: 10 * 2.5. Hmm, 10 times 2 is 20, and 1 times 2.5 is 2.5, so adding those together, 20 + 2.5 is 22.5. So, Stanley biked 22.5 miles. 

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. 10 mph for 2.5 hours. So, 10 * 2 is 20, and 10 * 0.5 is 5, so 20 + 5 is 25. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
