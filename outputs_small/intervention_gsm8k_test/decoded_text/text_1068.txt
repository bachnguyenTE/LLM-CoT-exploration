Q: One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.  Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Then Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.  How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about how many meatballs are left in the sandwich after some are eaten. Let me break it down.

First, it says that one meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. That seems straightforward. So, each sandwich has 4 meatballs.

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. Hmm, okay. So, let me parse that. "10 meatball sub sandwiches" – that must be 10 sandwiches. Then, she ordered 3 less than that. So, 10 minus 3. Let me write that down:

Sidney's initial order = 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Wait, that seems right. So, she ordered 7 sandwiches. Each has 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs she ordered is 7 times 4. Let me calculate that:

Total meatballs ordered by Sidney = 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

Okay, so she starts with 28 meatballs. Then Mark ate 4 of them. So, Mark ate 4 meatballs from the 28. So, how many are left after Mark ate?

Remaining after Mark ate = 28 - 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, now, Mark ate 4, so there are 24 left. Then, the problem says "Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches." So, she ordered 3 more. So, she adds 3 more sandwiches to the remaining 24.

Wait, that seems right. So, she had 24 left, then she ordered 3 more. So, the total number of sandwiches now is 24 + 3 = 27.

But, that seems right. So, now, she has 27 sandwiches. Each has 4 meatballs, so the total meatballs now are 27 * 4.

Let me compute that:

Total meatballs after Mark ate and then more ordered = 27 * 4 = 108 meatballs.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 108.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Wait, that seems right. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, 10 - 3 = 7. So, 7 sandwiches.

2. Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

3. Mark ate 4 of them, so 28 - 4 = 24 meatballs left.

4. Then, Mark ate 4, so 24 left.

5. Then, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. So, 24 + 3 = 27 sandwiches.

6. Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so 27 * 4 = 108 meatballs.

So, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 108.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 108.

But, that seems right. Let me think if I made any mistakes.

Wait, that seems right. So, the steps are:

- Initial order: 7 sandwiches.

- Total meatballs: 28.

- Mark eats 4: 24 left.

- Then, she adds 3 more: 27.

- Total meatballs: 27 * 4 = 108.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way.

Total initial order: 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4, so 28 - 4 = 24.

Then, she adds 3 more, so 24 + 3 = 27.

Total meatballs: 27 * 4 = 108.

Yes, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

Total after Mark ate: 24.

Then, she adds 3, so 27.

Total meatballs: 27 * 4 = 108.

Yes, same.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total after Mark ate and then the additional sandwiches.

So, initial: 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4: 28 - 4 = 24.

Then, she adds 3: 24 + 3 = 27.

Total meatballs: 27 * 4 = 108.

Yes, same.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total after Mark ate and then the additional sandwiches as:

Total after Mark ate: 24.

Then, she adds 3, so
