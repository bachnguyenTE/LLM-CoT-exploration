A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends. There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there were no leftovers. I need to figure out how many dumplings Larry cooked in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, let's figure out how many dumplings each male ate. The problem says each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more than that. So, if each female ate 3, then each male must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. That makes sense.

Now, there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by all the females would be 6 multiplied by 3. Let me write that out: 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings. So, the females ate 18 dumplings in total.

Next, there are 8 males, and each of them ate 4 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males would be 8 multiplied by 4. That would be 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings. So, the males ate 32 dumplings in total.

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, I need to add the dumplings eaten by the females and the dumplings eaten by the males together. So, that would be 18 + 32. Let me calculate that: 18 + 32 = 50. So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. Each female ate 3, so 6 females would be 6*3=18. Each male ate 4, so 8 males would be 8*4=32. Adding those together, 18+32=50. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step follows logically from the previous one. The key was figuring out how many dumplings each male ate based on the information given, then calculating the total for both males and females, and then adding them together. It all adds up to 50 dumplings. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \boxed{50}.

Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends, consisting of 8 males (including Larry) and 6 females. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. 

First, we determine how many dumplings each male ate:
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
- There are 6 females, so the total dumplings eaten by females is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

Then, we calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
- There are 8 males, so the total dumplings eaten by males is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

Finally, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
- The total number of dumplings is \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\).
