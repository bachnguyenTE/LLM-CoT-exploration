Q: Carly had 80 cards, 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them, 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them, and the others had the letter D. How many of the cards had the letter D on them?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Carly and her cards. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says she had 80 cards, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 80 cards? Hmm, okay, so 80 cards in total. Let me write that down.

Total cards: 80.

Now, it says 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. So, I need to find out how many of those are A cards. 

To find 2/5 of 80, I can do 80 multiplied by 2/5. Let me calculate that. 

80 divided by 5 is 16.6, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 5 times 16 is 80, so 5 times 16.6 is 88? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
