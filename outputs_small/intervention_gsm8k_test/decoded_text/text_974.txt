Q: Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tyler wants to buy some books, and I need to figure out how many hours he has to work to afford all of them. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me list out what Tyler needs to buy. He wants a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that's $13, and a children's cookbook that's $8. Hmm, so I should add up the total cost of these books to see how much money he needs altogether.

Let me write that out: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook). Let me add them up. 18 plus 13 is 31, and then 31 plus 8 is 39. So, the total cost of all the books is $39.

Now, Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, I need to figure out how much more money he needs to buy the books. To do that, I'll subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books. That would be $39 minus $14.

Let me calculate that: 39 minus 14. Hmm, 39 minus 10 is 28, and then minus 3 more is 25. Wait, that seems right. So, Tyler needs an additional $25 to buy all the books.

Alright, Tyler needs $25 more. Now, he earns $5 per hour. I need to find out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. To find the number of hours, I'll divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage.

So, that's $25 divided by $5 per hour. Let me do that division: 25 divided by 5 is 5. So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to earn the remaining $25.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The total cost was $39, he has $14 saved, so 39 minus 14 is indeed 25. And 25 divided by 5 is 5. Yeah, that seems correct.

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford all his books. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Tyler has to work \boxed{5} hours.

Tyler wants to buy a dictionary, a dinosaur book, and a children's cookbook. The costs of these books are $18, $13, and $8 respectively. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the books:
\[
18 + 13 + 8 = 39
\]

Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:
\[
39 - 14 = 25
\]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To determine how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[
25 \div 5 = 5
\]

Thus, Tyler has to work \boxed{5} hours.
