Q: A loaf of bread at the bakery costs $2. Bagels cost $1 each. How much more do 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Since each loaf costs $2, multiplying 3 by $2 gives a total of $6 for the bread.

Next, I'll calculate the cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel is priced at $1, so multiplying 2 by $1 results in $2 for the bagels.

Finally, to find out how much more the bread costs compared to the bagels, I'll subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 minus $2 equals $4.
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:**
   
   Each loaf of bread costs \$2.
   
   \[
   3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 2 bagels:**
   
   Each bagel costs \$1.
   
   \[
   2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2
   \]

3. **Determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:**
   
   Subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread.
   
   \[
   \$6 - \$2 = \$4
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
