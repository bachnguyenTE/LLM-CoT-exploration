Q: Luke is buying fabric for new curtains. There are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide and Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. How much fabric should he buy?

Okay, so Luke needs to buy fabric for new curtains, and there are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows. Hmm, let me figure this out step by step.

First, I need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each one is 35 inches wide, I can multiply the number of windows by the width of each window. So, that would be 5 multiplied by 35 inches. Let me write that down:

Total width = Number of windows × Width per window
Total width = 5 × 35 inches

Hmm, 5 times 35. Let me calculate that. 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 5 is 25, so adding those together gives 175. So, the total width is 175 inches. Wait, that seems right. 35 inches times 5 is indeed 175 inches.

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows. So, I need to multiply the total width by 2. That would be:

Fabric needed = 2 × Total width
Fabric needed = 2 × 175 inches

Let me compute that. 2 times 175. Well, 2 times 100 is 200, and 2 times 75 is 150. Adding those together, 200 + 150 is 370. So, the fabric needed is 370 inches.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 5 windows at 35 inches each: 5×35=175 inches. Then, twice that is 350 inches? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 175×2 is 350. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 175×2 is 350. So, 350 inches is the total fabric needed.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each window is 35 inches, five windows, so 5×35=175 inches. Then, twice that is 350 inches. Wait, that seems right. 175×2 is 350. So, 350 inches is the total fabric needed.

Wait, that seems right. So, 350 inches is the answer. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in feet? Since 12 inches is 1 foot, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 35 inches is about 2.9167 feet, so five windows would be about 14.5833 feet. Then, twice that is about 29.1666 feet. But, that seems right. 29.1666 feet is equal to 350 inches because 1 foot is 12 inches, so 29.1666×12=350 inches. So, that's consistent.

So, whether I calculate in inches or convert to feet, I get the same result. So, 350 inches is the total fabric needed.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 350 inches. So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret the question. It says, "equal to 2 times the total width of the windows." So, that would be 2×(5×35)=2×175=350 inches. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if the question had said, "twice the width of each window," it would have been different, but, that seems right. It says, "equal to 2 times the total width of the windows." So, that's 2×(sum of all window widths). So, that's 2×175=350 inches.

So, yeah, 350 inches is the answer. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 350 inches is the total fabric needed. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
Luke should buy \boxed{350} inches of fabric.

Luke needs to buy fabric for new curtains, and there are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric equal to twice the total width of the windows.

First, we calculate the total width of all the windows:
