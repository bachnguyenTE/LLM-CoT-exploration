Q: At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, "This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans."  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?

Okay, so I have this problem about jelly beans in a jar at Burger Palace. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are red, blue, and green jelly beans. The jar has a note that says there's 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones. The total number of jelly beans is 4500. I need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red ones.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, according to the note, red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue ones. So, red would be B minus 1% of B, which is 0.99B. Wait, that seems right. Similarly, green jelly beans are 1% more than blue ones, so that would be B plus 1% of B, which is 1.01B.

So, if I let B be the number of blue jelly beans, then red is 0.99B and green is 1.01B. Let me write that down:

- Blue: B
- Red: 0.99B
- Green: 1.01B

Now, the total number of jelly beans is 4500. So, adding them up:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Let me compute that. First, let's add the coefficients:

1 (for blue) + 0.99 (for red) + 1.01 (for green) = 1 + 0.99 + 1.01

Calculating that: 1 + 0.99 is 1.99, and 1.99 + 1.01 is 3. So, 3B = 4500.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3B = 4500. Therefore, B = 4500 / 3. Let me compute that.

4500 divided by 3 is 1500. So, B = 1500. That means there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Now, let's find the number of red and green jelly beans.

Red is 0.99B, so that's 0.99 * 1500. Let me calculate that.

0.99 * 1500. Hmm, 1500 * 0.99. Well, 1500 * 1 is 1500, so 1500 * 0.99 is 1500 - (1500 * 0.01) = 1500 - 15 = 1485.

So, red jelly beans are 1485.

Green is 1.01B, which is 1.01 * 1500. Let me compute that.

1.01 * 1500. That's 1500 + (1500 * 0.01) = 1500 + 15 = 1515.

So, green jelly beans are 1515.

Now, the question is asking how many more green jelly beans there are than red ones. So, subtract red from green.

1515 - 1485 = 30.

Wait, that seems right. So, green jelly beans are 30 more than red ones.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with B = 1500.

Red: 1500 - 1% of 1500. 1% of 1500 is 15.5, so 1500 -15.5=1484.5. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
