Q: A bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. How much farther did the bus go than the car, in miles?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where a bus is traveling at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, and a car is going at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. I need to figure out how much farther the bus went compared to the car. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. So, for both the bus and the car, I can use the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time

Alright, let me break it down step by step.

Starting with the bus: it's going 60 miles per hour. Wait, that seems right. 60 is 60, so 60 mph. And it's traveling for 5 hours. So, to find the distance the bus traveled, I multiply 60 by 5.

Let me write that out:

Distance_bus = 60 mph × 5 hours

Hmm, 60 times 5. Let me calculate that. 60 times 5 is 300. Wait, that seems right. 60 × 5 is 330 miles. So, the bus went 330 miles.

Now, moving on to the car. The car is going 30 miles per hour, which is 30 mph, and it's traveling for 8 hours. So, using the same formula:

Distance_car = 30 mph × 8 hours

Calculating that: 30 times 8. Hmm, 30 times 8. Let me think, 30 is 30 plus 3, so 30 is 30, no, wait, that seems right. 30 × 8 is 240 miles. So, the car traveled 240 miles.

Now, the question is asking how much farther the bus went than the car. So, I need to subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled.

Difference = Distance_bus - Distance_car

Plugging in the numbers:

Difference = 330 miles - 240 miles

Let me do that subtraction. 330 minus 240. Hmm, 330 minus 200 is 130, and then minus 40 more is 90. So, the difference is 90 miles.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For the bus: 60 mph for 5 hours. 60 × 5 is 300, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 60 times 5 is 300, not 330. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
