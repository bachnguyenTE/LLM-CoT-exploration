Q: Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Abraham who owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50 and then another quarter for $30. Then he sold the remaining part for $3 per square meter. I need to figure out how much money he'll make in total after selling all his land. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. Wait, that seems right. Half of 80 is 40, so 40 square meters sold for $50. Then, after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. Hmm, 1/4 of 80 is 20, so 20 square meters sold for $30. Then, the remaining land was sold for $3 per square meter. So, I need to calculate the total money he made from all these sales.

Let me write down the information:

- Total land: 80 square meters
- Sold half (40 sqm) for $50
- Sold another 1/4 (2 sqm) for $30
- Sold the remaining land for $3 per sqm

So, first, let's figure out how much money he made from the first sale. He sold 40 sqm for $50. So, that's straightforward. Then, he sold 2 sqm for $30. So, that's another amount. Then, the remaining land is 80 - 40 - 2 = 42 sqm. Wait, that seems right. 80 - 40 is 40, minus 2 is 42. So, he sold 42 sqm at $3 per sqm.

So, let me calculate each part:

1. First sale: 40 sqm for $50. So, that's $50.

2. Second sale: 2 sqm for $30. So, that's $30.

3. Third sale: 42 sqm at $3 per sqm. So, 42 * 3 = $126.

Now, let's add all these up: $50 + $30 + $126.

Wait, that seems right. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 50 + 30 is 80. Then, 80 + 26 is 106. So, total money earned is $106.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First sale: 40 sqm * $50 per 40 sqm? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
