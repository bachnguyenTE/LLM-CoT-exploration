Q: Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. Then she gets 20 marbles from her friend. How many marbles does she have now?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of marbles Maddison initially has. She has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. To find the total, I multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box.

Next, Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. I will add these 20 marbles to the initial total to find the new total number of marbles she has.

Finally, I will present the final answer clearly.

**Solution:**

Maddison starts with 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles she initially has, multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:

\[
5 \text{ boxes} \times 50 \text{ marbles/box} = 250 \text{ marbles}
\]

Then, Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, add these 20 marbles to the initial total:

\[
250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 272 \text{ marbles}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{272}
\]
