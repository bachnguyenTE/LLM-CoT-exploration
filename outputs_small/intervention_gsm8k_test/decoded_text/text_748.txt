Q: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Carl, Sean, and Cal marbles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says:

"Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?"

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many marbles each person has and then add Carl's and Cal's marbles together.

Starting with Sean, the problem already tells me that Sean has 56 marbles. So, Sean = 56 marbles.

Next, it says Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Hmm, so if Sean has half as many as Cal, that means Cal has twice as many as Sean. Let me write that down.

If Sean = 56, then Cal = 2 * Sean.

So, Cal = 2 * 56. Let me calculate that. 2 times 56 is 112. So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, the problem also states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, if Sean has 56 marbles, then Carl has 4 times that. Let me write that.

Carl = 4 * Sean.

So, Carl = 4 * 56. Calculating that, 4 times 56 is 224. So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Now, the question is asking for the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have. So, I need to add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together.

Carl has 224 marbles, and Cal has 112 marbles. So, 224 + 112.

Let me add those. 224 plus 100 is 324, and then plus 12 is 336. So, 224 + 112 equals 336.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Sean is 56 marbles. Cal has half as many as Sean, so 56 divided by 2 is 28. Wait, that seems right. 56 divided by 2 is 28. So, Cal has 28 marbles.
