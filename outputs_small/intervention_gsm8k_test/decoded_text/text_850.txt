Q: Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many goats were sold from each farm.

From Farm X, 10 goats were sold.

From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, which is 20 goats.

Next, I'll calculate the remaining goats in each farm.

In Farm X, there were originally 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, 45 goats remain.

In Farm Y, there were originally 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, 25 goats remain.

Finally, I'll add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left.

45 goats in Farm X plus 25 goats in Farm Y equals 70 goats in total.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Goats:**
   - **Farm X:** 55 goats
   - **Farm Y:** 45 goats

2. **Goats Sold:**
   - **From Farm X:** 10 goats
   - **From Farm Y:** Twice as many as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

3. **Remaining Goats:**
   - **Farm X:** \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - **Farm Y:** \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total Goats Left:**
   \[
   45 \text{ (Farm X)} + 25 \text{ (Farm Y)} = 70 \text{ goats}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{70}
\]
