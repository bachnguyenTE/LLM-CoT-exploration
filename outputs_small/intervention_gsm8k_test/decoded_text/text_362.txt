Q: Mark makes custom dog beds. A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 beds for Rottweilers and 3 beds for collies. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing. That's straightforward. So, each Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds. Got that.

Next, a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. That's also clear. So, each chihuahahua bed is 2 pounds. But, that seems right. I mean, chihuahua beds are usually smaller, so 2 pounds makes sense.

Now, the tricky part is the collie bed. It says a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds.

Let me write that down. The average stuffing per collie bed would be (8 + 2) divided by 2. So, that's 10 divided by 2, which is 5. So, each collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing. That seems reasonable because collies are generally smaller than Rottweilers but, that seems right. So, 5 pounds per collie bed.

Alright, so now I need to figure out how much stuffing is needed for 4 Rottweiler beds and 3 collie beds.

Let me calculate the stuffing for the Rottweiler beds first. Each Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, so 4 beds would be 4 times 8. Let me do that: 4 * 8 = 32 pounds. So, 32 pounds of stuffing for the Rottweiler beds.

Now, for the collie beds. Each collie bed is 5 pounds, and we need 3 of them. So, 3 * 5 = 15 pounds. That seems straightforward.

Now, to find the total stuffing needed, I just add the stuffing for Rottweiler beds and collie beds together. So, 32 + 15. Let me add that: 32 + 15 is 47. So, 47 pounds in total.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Rottweiler: 4 beds * 8 pounds each = 32 pounds. That's correct.

Collie: 3 beds * 5 pounds each = 15 pounds. That's also correct.

Total: 32 + 15 = 47 pounds. Yeah, that adds up.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating the average stuffing per collie bed first and then multiplying by the number of beds. Let me try that.

Average stuffing per collie bed is (8 + 2)/2 = 5 pounds, as I did before. So, 3 collie beds would be 3 * 5 = 15 pounds. Then, 4 Rottweiler beds is 4 * 8 = 32 pounds. Adding them together, 32 + 15 = 47 pounds. Same result. So, that seems consistent.

I think that's solid. So, Mark needs 47 pounds of stuffing in total.

**Final Answer**
Mark needs \boxed{47} pounds of stuffing.

Mark needs to determine the total amount of stuffing required to make 4 Rottweiler beds and 3 collie beds. 

1. Each Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. Each chihuahahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. Each collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahahua bed. The average is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The total stuffing needed for 4 Rottweiler beds is:
   \[
   4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ pounds}
   \]
5. The total stuffing needed for 3 collie beds is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]
6. Adding these together gives the total stuffing required:
   \[
   32 + 15 = 47 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Mark needs \boxed{47} pounds of stuffing.
