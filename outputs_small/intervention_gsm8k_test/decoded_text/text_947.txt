Q: Jasmine's teacher gives stickers for reward. She was given 15 stickers for participating in class, but she lost 7 stickers during playtime. However, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. How many stickers does she have at the end?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.

She loses 7 stickers during playtime, so we subtract 7 from 15, leaving her with 8 stickers.

Then, her teacher gives her an additional 5 stickers for helping her classmates, so we add 5 to the remaining 8 stickers.

Finally, we add 5 to 8 to find the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end.
