Q: Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?

Okay, so I need to figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house. Let me read the problem again and break it down step by step.

He sold his house for $400,000. That's the selling price. Now, he paid transfer fees and brokerage fees. Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, and the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. So, I need to calculate all these expenses and subtract them from the selling price to get the net proceeds.

First, let me calculate the transfer fees. Transfer fees are 3% of $400,000. Hmm, 3% is the same as 0.03 in decimal. So, 0.03 multiplied by 400,000. Let me do that calculation.

400,000 * 0.03. Let me break it down: 400,000 * 0.03 is the same as 400,000 * 3/100. So, 400,000 divided by 100 is 4,000. Then, 4,000 multiplied by 3 is 12,000. So, transfer fees are $12,000.

Next, the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. 5% is 0.05. So, 400,000 * 0.05. Let me compute that. 400,000 * 0.05 is 200,000. So, the brokerage fee is $200,000.

Now, he also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. So, that's another expense. So, all the expenses are transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the loan amount.

Let me add up all these expenses: transfer fees ($120,000) + brokerage fees ($200,000) + loan amount ($250,0000). So, 120,0000 + 200,000 is 320,000, and then adding 250,000 gives 570,000.

So, total expenses are $570,0000.

Now, the selling price was $400,000. So, net proceeds would be selling price minus total expenses. So, 400,000 - 570,000. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 400,000 minus 570,000 is negative 170,000. That can't be right because net proceeds can't be negative. Hmm, that must mean I made a mistake.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my calculations again.

First, transfer fees: 3% of 400,000. 3% is 0.03, so 400,000 * 0.03. Let me compute 400,000 * 0.03 is 120,000, so 3% is 120,000. That's correct.

Brokerage fee: 5% of 400,000. 5% is 0.05, so 400,000 * 0.05. 400,000 * 0.05 is 200,000. Correct.

Loan amount: 250,000. So, adding all together: 120,000 + 200,000 + 250,000. Let's add 120,000 + 200,000 first, which is 320,000, then add 250,000, which is 570,000. So, total expenses are 570,000.

But, that seems right. So, selling price is 400,000, which is less than total expenses of 570,000. So, net proceeds would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem.

Wait, that seems right. Maybe the transfer fees and brokerage are not on the selling price,
