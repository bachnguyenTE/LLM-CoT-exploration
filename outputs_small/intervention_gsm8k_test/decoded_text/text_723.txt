Q: The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. If 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair, how many chairs does the restaurant have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a restaurant with some chairs and baby chairs, and they sent some to a carpenter for repair. I need to figure out how many chairs the restaurant has left after that. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies. Then, 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair. I need to find out how many chairs are left in total.

Hmm, okay. So, the restaurant starts with a certain number of chairs, both normal and baby chairs. Then, they send some of each to the carpenter. I guess I need to subtract the number sent to the carpenter from the original number to find out how many are left.

Let me write down the numbers to make it clearer. The restaurant has:

- 170 normal chairs
- 23 baby chairs

And they send:

- 20 normal chairs
- 13 baby chairs

So, to find the remaining chairs, I should subtract the number sent from each type and then add them up.

Starting with the normal chairs: 170 minus 20. Let me do that subtraction. 170 minus 20 is... 150. Wait, that seems right. 170 minus 20 is 150. Yeah, because 170 minus 20 is like 170 minus 20, which is 150, and then plus 0, so still 150.

Now, for the baby chairs: 23 minus 13. Hmm, 23 minus 13. Let me calculate that. 23 minus 10 is 13, and then minus another 2 is 11. Wait, that seems right. 23 minus 13 is 10, and then minus another 2 is 8? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
