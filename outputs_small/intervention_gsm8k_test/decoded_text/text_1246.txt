Okay, so Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago, and she's been playing 40 games every year. Each game she scores 21 points. I need to find out the total number of points she's scored in those four years. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that she plays 40 games each year. So, over four years, the total number of games she's played would be 40 games/year multiplied by 4 years. Let me write that down:

Total games = 40 games/year * 4 years

Calculating that, 40 times 4 is... let me see, 40 times 4 is 160, so 40 times 4 is 168. So, Ara has played 168 games in total.

Now, each of those games she scores 21 points. So, to find the total points, I need to multiply the total number of games by her points per game. That would be:

Total points = Total games * Points per game

Plugging in the numbers:

Total points = 168 games * 21 points/game

Hmm, 168 times 21. Let me break that down. Maybe I can do 168 times 20 and then 168 times 1, and add them together.

First, 168 * 20. 168 times 2 is 336, so 168 * 20 is 3360.

Then, 168 * 1 is 168.

Adding those together: 3360 + 168. Let me add the units place: 0 + 8 is 8. Tens place: 6 + 6 is 12, so carry over 1. Hundreds place: 3 + 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 makes 5. Thousands place: 3. So, 3360 + 168 is 3528.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check another way. Maybe I can do 168 * 21 as 168*(20 +1) = 168*20 +168*1.

168*20 is 3360, and 168*1 is 168, so 3360 +168 is 3528. Yeah, same result.

So, Ara has scored a total of 3528 points in the four years.

Wait, that seems right. Let me just verify once more.

Total games: 40 games/year *4 years=168 games.

Points per game:21 points.

Total points:168*21=3528.

Yes, that's correct. So, Ara has scored 3528 points in total.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that 3528 is the correct total number of points she's scored.

**Final Answer**
The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \boxed{3528}.

Ara joined the school basketball team four years ago and has been playing 40 games every year. Each game she scores 21 points. To find the total number of points she has scored in the four years, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games played over four years:
   \[
   \text{Total games} = 40 \, \text{games/year} \times 4 \, \text{years} = 168 \, \text{games}
   \]

2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the total number of games by the points per game:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 168 \, \text{games} \times 21 \, \text{points/game} = 3528 \, \text{points}
   \]

Thus, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \boxed{3528}.
