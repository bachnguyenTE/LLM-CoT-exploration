Q: Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Tracy has a piece of wire that's 4 feet long, and she's using it to support tomato plants in her garden. The wire is being cut into smaller pieces, each 6 inches long. The question is asking how many pieces she obtained. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, if the wire is 4 feet long, I can convert that to inches to make it easier to work with the 6-inch pieces. Let me do that calculation. 4 feet multiplied by 12 inches per foot would be 4 * 12. Let me compute that: 4 times 10 is 40, and 4 times 2 is 8, so 40 + 8 is 52. Wait, that seems right. So, 4 feet is 52 inches.

Now, Tracy is cutting this 52-inch wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. So, I need to figure out how many 6-inch pieces can be made from a 52-inch wire. This sounds like a division problem. If I divide the total length by the length of each piece, I should get the number of pieces.

So, 52 inches divided by 6 inches per piece. Let me write that out: 52 ÷ 6. Hmm, doing this division. 6 goes into 52 how many times? Well, 6 times 8 is 48, which is less than 52, and 6 times 9 is 54, which is more than 52. So, 8 times with a remainder. Let me calculate the exact number.

52 divided by 6. 6 goes into 52 eight times with a remainder. 8 times 6 is 48, subtract that from 52, and you get 4. So, 52 ÷ 6 is 8 with a remainder of 4. But, that seems right. So, 8 pieces of 6 inches each would account for 48 * 6 = 48 inches, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
