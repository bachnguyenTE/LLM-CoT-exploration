Q: A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.  How many sunflower seeds are there altogether?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about sunflowers and their seeds. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small one. I need to find the total number of seeds altogether. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I know that a dozen is 12, so 3 dozen seeds would be 3 times 12. Let me write that out: 3 × 12. Let me calculate that. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 2 is 6, so 30 + 6 is 39. So, a small sunflower has 39 seeds. That seems right.

Now, the large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small one. Hmm, okay, so I need to find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds and then add that to the original number. Wait, that seems right. So, 50% is the same as 5.5%, right? Or is it 50%? Hmm, the question says 50%, so that's 50%. So, 50% more seeds than the small one.

Let me make sure I understand that correctly. If the small sunflower has 39 seeds, then the large one has 39 plus 50% of 39. Wait, that seems right. So, first, I need to calculate 50% of 39 seeds. Let me write that as a mathematical expression.

So, 50% of 39 is equal to 0.50 × 39. Let me compute that. 0.50 times 39. Hmm, 0.5 times 39 is 19.5, and 0.0 times 39 is 3.9, so adding those together, 19.5 + 3.9 is 23.4. Wait, that seems right. So, 50% of 39 is 19.5, and 55% would be 23.45? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
