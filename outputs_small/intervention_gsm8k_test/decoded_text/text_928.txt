Q: Rita hand-picks Junebugs off of her plants every summer.  On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.  On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  Thursday she removed 48 and on Friday she removed 57.  What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?

Okay, so I have this problem about Rita picking Junebugs over the week. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says she picks Junebugs every summer, and on Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. Then, on both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as she did on Monday. On Thursday, she removed 48, and on Friday, 57. The question is asking for the average number of Junebugs she removes per day.

Alright, so to find the average, I know I need to add up all the Junebugs she removed during the week and then divide by the number of days. That makes sense because average is total divided by the number of items.

Let me break it down day by day.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs. That's straightforward.

Then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday. So, if Monday was 39, Tuesday and Wednesday each would be 2 times 39. Let me calculate that. 2 times 39 is 78. So, both Tuesday and Wednesday she removed 78 each day.

So, Tuesday: 78

Wednesday: 78

Then, on Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs. That's given.

And on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs. Also given.

So, now I need to add up all these numbers to get the total Junebugs removed.

Let me write that out:

Monday: 39

Tuesday: 78

Wednesday: 78

Thursday: 48

Friday: 57

Wait, that seems right. So, adding them all together.

First, let me add Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday. So, 39 + 78 + 78.

Let me compute that step by step.

39 + 78: 39 + 70 is 109, plus 8 is 117.

Then, 117 + 78: 117 + 70 is 187, plus 8 is 195.

So, the total for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 195.

Then, Thursday she removed 48, so 195 + 48.

195 + 40 is 235, minus 2 is 233.

Wait, that seems right. 195 + 48 is 233.

Then, Friday she removed 57, so 233 + 57.

233 + 50 is 283, plus 7 is 290.

So, total Junebugs removed during the week is 290.

Now, how many days is that? From Monday to Friday, that's 5 days.

So, to find the average, I take the total, which is 290, and divide by 5.

290 divided by 5.

Let me compute that.

5 goes into 29 five times (5*5=25), subtract 25 from 29, you get 4. Bring down the 0, making it 40.

5 goes into 40 eight times. So, 58.

So, 290 divided by 5 is 58.

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs she removes per day is 58.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with Monday: 39.

Tuesday and Wednesday: 78 each, so 78*2=156.

Thursday: 48.

Friday: 57.

So, adding them up: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57.

Let me add 39 + 156 first. 39 + 156: 39 + 150 is 189, plus 6 is 195.

Then, 195 + 48: 195 + 40 is 235, plus 8 is 243.

Then, 243 + 57: 243 + 50 is 298, plus 7 is 305.

Wait, that seems right. 39 + 156 +48 +57 is 330? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
