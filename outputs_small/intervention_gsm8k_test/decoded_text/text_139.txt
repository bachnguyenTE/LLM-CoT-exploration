Q: In a candy machine, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. If there are 12 blue gumballs how many pink ones are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a candy machine with pink and blue gumballs. It says there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. Hmm, and it tells me there are 12 blue gumballs. I need to find out how many pink ones there are. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two types of gumballs: pink and blue. The number of pink gumballs is related to the number of blue gumballs. Specifically, it's four times the number of blue gumballs plus 22 more. So, if I let the number of blue gumballs be a variable, say B, then the number of pink gumballs, which I'll call P, can be expressed as P = 4B + 22.

Wait, that seems right. Let me write that down:

P = 4B + 22

And we know that B, the number of blue gumballs, is 12. So, substituting that into the equation, we get:

P = 4 * 12 + 22

Let me compute that. 4 times 12 is 48, right? So, 48 plus 22. Hmm, 48 plus 20 is 68, and then plus another 22 is 90. Wait, that seems right. So, 48 + 22 is 70? Wait, that seems right. 48 + 20 is 68, plus 2 is 70. Wait, that seems right. So, 48 + 22 is 70? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
