Q: Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 per month. If the streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine the total number of months in a year, which is 12 months.

Next, I'll calculate the number of months in the first half of the year, which is 6 months.

The streaming service charges $140 per month for the first half of the year. So, the total amount paid for the first 6 months is 6 multiplied by $140, which equals $840.

For the second half of the year, the streaming service charges 10% less than the initial rate. To find the reduced rate, I'll calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140. This gives a reduced rate of $129.60 per month.

The total amount paid for the second 6 months is 6 multiplied by $129.60, which equals $777.60.

Finally, I'll add the amounts paid for both halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena has paid by the end of the year: $840 plus $777.60 equals $1,617.60.

To determine the total amount Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Monthly charge:** \$140
- **First half of the year:** Full charge
- **Second half of the year:** 10% less than the initial charge

### **Step 1: Calculate the Number of Months in Each Half of the Year**
- **Total months in a year:** 12 months
- **First half of the year:** 6 months
- **Second half of the year:** 6 months

### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Payment for the First Half of the Year**
- **Monthly charge:** \$140
- **Total for 6 months:** 
  \[
  6 \times \$140 = \$840
  \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Reduced Monthly Charge for the Second Half of the Year**
- **Original monthly charge:** \$140
- **10% reduction:** 
  \[
  10\% \text{ of } \$140 = 0.10 \times \$140 = \$14
  \]
- **Reduced monthly charge:** 
  \[
  \$140 - \$14 = \$129.60
  \]

### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Payment for the Second Half of the Year**
- **Reduced monthly charge:** \$129.60
- **Total for 6 months:** 
  \[
  6 \times \$129.60 = \$777.60
  \]

### **Step 5: Calculate the Total Amount Paid for the Year**
- **Total for first half:** \$840
- **Total for second half:** \$777.60
- **Total payment for the year:** 
  \[
  \$840 + \$777.60 = \$1,\!617.60
  \]

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1,\!617.60}
\]
