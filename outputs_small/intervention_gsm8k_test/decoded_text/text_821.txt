Q: Hunter counted 50 cars packed in their school parking lot when entering class one morning. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Hunter counting cars in a school parking lot. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered the school in the morning. So, that's 50 cars. Then, during the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Hmm, so I think that means after the first break, the total number of cars in the parking lot increased by 20. 

Wait, that seems right. So, initially, there were 50 cars. Then, during the first break, 20 more came in. So, to find out how many cars were there after the first break, I should add those two numbers together. Let me write that down:

50 (initial count) + 20 (additional cars during first break) = 72 cars.

So, after the first break, there were 72 cars in the parking lot. 

Then, the problem says that when Hunter got out of class for lunch, he realized that half the number of cars had gone. Hmm, okay, so half the number of cars had left the parking lot. That means the number of cars that left is half of the total number of cars at that time.

Wait, that seems right. So, if there were 72 cars after the first break, half of them had left. So, the number of cars that left is 72 divided by 2. Let me calculate that:

72 / 2 = 36.

So, 36 cars had left the parking lot after the first break. That means the number of cars remaining in the parking lot after lunch is 36. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if 36 cars left, then the number of cars remaining is 36. But, that seems right. 

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of cars he counted during lunch break would be the number of cars that remained after lunch. So, 36 cars. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 36. 

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 

So, initial count: 50 cars. Then, 20 more came in during the first break, so 50 + 20 = 70 cars. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
