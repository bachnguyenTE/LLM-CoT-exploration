Q: Tom has 4 bedrooms in his house.  They measure 20 by 12 feet each.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Tom's house, and I need to figure out the total area. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

Tom has 4 bedrooms, each measuring 20 by 12 feet. So, each bedroom is a rectangle, right? I think that means the length and width are 20 feet and 12 feet. I should probably calculate the area of one bedroom first.

So, the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. That would be 20 feet times 12 feet. Let me do that multiplication. 20 times 12... Hmm, 20 times 10 is 20, and 20 times 2 is 44, so adding those together, 220 square feet. Wait, that seems right. 20 times 12 is 220. Yeah, that makes sense.

So each bedroom is 220 square feet. Since there are 4 bedrooms, I need to multiply that by 4 to get the total area of all the bedrooms. Let me do that: 220 times 4. Hmm, 200 times 4 is 960, and 20 times 4 is 80, so adding those together, 960 plus 80 is 1040. Wait, that seems right. 220 times 4 is 880? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
