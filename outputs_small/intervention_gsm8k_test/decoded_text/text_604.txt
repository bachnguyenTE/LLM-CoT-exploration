Q: Howard spends $8 dollars at the arcade on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much at the arcade as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much at the arcade as he spent on Tuesday. If he originally had $100, how much money does he have left?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Howard spending money at the arcade over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. He starts with $100, and I need to figure out how much he has left after spending on the arcade each day. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, on Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade. That seems straightforward. So, he spends $8 on the first day. I can write that down as:

Monday: $8

Now, moving on to Tuesday. The problem says he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Hmm, okay, so if he spent $8 on Monday, then on Tuesday he spends 2 times that amount. Let me calculate that.

Tuesday: 2 * $8 = $16

Alright, so on Tuesday, he spends $16. That makes sense because twice as much as $8 is $16, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 2 times 8 is 16, yes.

Now, onto Wednesday. The problem states that he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. So, if he spent $16 on Tuesday, then on Wednesday he spends 4 times that amount. Let me compute that.

Wednesday: 4 * $16 = $64

Wait, that seems right. 4 times 16 is 64. So, on Wednesday, he spends $64.

Now, let me recap the amounts he spent each day:

- Monday: $8
- Tuesday: $16
- Wednesday: $64

To find out how much he has left, I need to subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount, which was $100.

So, first, let me find the total amount he spent over the three days. That would be the sum of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Total spent = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday
Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64

Wait, that seems right. Let me add them up step by step.

First, add Monday and Tuesday: $8 + $16 = $24

Then, add Wednesday to that: $24 + $64 = $88

So, in total, he spent $88 over the three days.

Now, subtracting that from his original amount: $100 - $88.

Let me do that subtraction.

$100 - $88 = $12

Wait, that seems right. So, he has $2 left after spending $88 on the three days.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with Monday: $8. That's straightforward.

Tuesday: 2 times Monday's amount. 2 * 8 is 16. That's correct.

Wednesday: 4 times Tuesday's amount. 4 * 16 is 64. That's correct.

Total spent: 8 + 16 + 64. Let me add them again.

8 + 16 is 24, and 24 + 64 is 88. So, total spent is $88.

Original amount: $100. Subtracting $88 from $100 gives $2. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, he started with $100, spent $8 on Monday, $16 on Tuesday, and $64 on Wednesday, totaling $88. So, 100 - 88 is 2.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.

Alternatively, I can think of each day's spending as a multiple of Monday's spending.

On Monday, he spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent 2 times that, so 2 * 8 = 16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times the amount he spent on Tuesday, which is 4 * 16 = 64.

Alternatively, since each day's spending is a multiple of the previous day, we can model this as a geometric progression.

But, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a series.

But, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total spending as 8 + 16 + 64.

Wait, that seems right. 8 + 16 is 24, plus 64 is 88.

So, 100 - 88 is 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the total spending as 8*(1 + 2 + 4) = 8*7 = 56. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait,
