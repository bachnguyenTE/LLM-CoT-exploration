Q: Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?

Okay, so Mrs. Cruz is looking to buy a house, but, that seems right. She has a budget of $400,000. Wait, that seems right. Let me check. $400,000. Hmm, okay, so she saw a property that's priced at $350,000. Hmm, that's a bit lower than her budget, but, that seems right. So, she wants to know how much more the total price of the house is than her budget. So, she needs to figure out the total cost of the house, including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget to see how much over her budget she is.

Alright, so let's break this down. The selling price of the house is $350,000. Then, there's a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price. So, 5% of $350,000. And then, there's a transfer fee which is 12% of the selling price. So, 12% of $350,000. So, I need to calculate both of these fees and add them to the selling price to get the total price. Then, subtract the selling price from the total price to find out how much over her budget she is.

Let me write this down step by step.

First, the selling price is $350,000. Let me write that as 350,000 for simplicity.

Next, the brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. So, 5% is the same as 0.05 in decimal. So, 0.05 multiplied by 350,000.

Similarly, the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 multiplied by 350,000.

So, let me compute the brokerage fee first.

5% of 350,000 is 0.05 * 350,000. Let me calculate that.

0.05 * 350,000 is 175,000. Wait, that seems right. 5% of 350,000 is 17,500. So, 0.05 * 350,000 is 175,000. Wait, that seems right. 350,000 divided by 10 is 35,000, so 5% is 175,000. Wait, that seems right. 350,000 * 0.05 is 17,500. Wait, that seems right. 350,000 * 0.05 is 17,500.

Wait, that seems right. 350,000 * 0.05 is 17,500. Wait, that seems right. 350,000 * 0.05 is 17,500.

Okay, so the brokerage fee is $17,500.

Now, the transfer fee is 12% of 350,000. So, 0.12 * 350,000.

Let me compute that. 0.12 * 350,000.

Well, 0.1 * 350,000 is 35,000.0, and 0.02 * 350,000 is 7,000. So, adding those together, 35,000 + 7,000 is 42,000.

Wait, that seems right. 0.12 is 12%, so 10% is 35,000, so 12% is 1.2 times 10%, which is 35,000 * 1.2.

Wait, that seems right. 35,000 * 1.2 is 42,000.

So, the transfer fee is $42,000.

So, now, the total additional fees are the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee.

So, 17,500 + 42,000 is 59,500.

So, the total additional fees are $59,500.

So, the total price of the house is the selling price plus these fees.

So, 350,000 + 59,5
