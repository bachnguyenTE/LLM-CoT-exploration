Q: James gets 80 emails a day.  20% of those emails don't require any response.  He responds to the rest of them.  How many emails does he respond to in a 5 day work week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many emails James receives in a single day. He gets 80 emails, and 20% of them don't require a response. 

To find the number of emails that require a response, I'll calculate 20% of 80. 

20% of 80 is 0.64.

Since James works 5 days a week, I'll multiply the daily response emails by 5 to find the total number of response emails in a week.

0.64 multiplied by 5 equals 3.2.

Therefore, James responds to 3.2 emails in a 5-day work week.

**Solution:**

James receives 80 emails each day. Out of these, 20% don't require a response, and he responds to the remaining emails.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day:**
   
   \[
   \text{Emails requiring response} = 80\% \times 80 = 0.64
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of response emails in a 5-day work week:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total response emails} = 0.64 \times 5 = 3.2
   \]

Therefore, James responds to \(\boxed{3.2}\) emails in a 5-day work week.
