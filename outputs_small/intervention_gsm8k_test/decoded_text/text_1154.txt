Q: Mason likes eating carrots. If he eats 4 carrots each on weekdays and 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, how many carrots does he eat a week?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, I need to determine how many carrots Mason eats during the weekdays and on Saturday and Sunday.

There are 5 weekdays, and he eats 4 carrots each day. So, I'll multiply 5 by 4 to find the total for weekdays.

Next, on Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in a weekend, so I'll multiply 2 by 5 to find the total for the weekend.

Finally, I'll add the total from weekdays and the total from the weekend to find the overall number of carrots Mason eats in a week.

**Solution:**

Mason eats carrots in two different ways:

1. **During the Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - **Number of weekdays:** 5
   - **Carrots eaten each weekday:** 4
   - **Total carrots during weekdays:** \( 5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} \)

2. **On Saturday and Sunday:**
   - **Number of weekend days:** 2
   - **Carrots eaten each weekend day:** 5
   - **Total carrots on weekends:** \( 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \)

3. **Total Carrots Eaten in a Week:**
   - **Carrots during weekdays:** 20
   - **Carrots on weekends:** 10
   - **Total:** \( 20 + 10 = 32 \text{ carrots} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32}
