Q: There are 29 pupils in a class. The teacher has 9 coupons; each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. The teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. After redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, how many bottles of apple juice does the teacher have for herself?

Okay, so I have this problem here about a teacher giving out apple juice bottles to her students. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 29 pupils in the class. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. The teacher gives each student 2 bottles for lunch. After redeeming all her coupons and giving out the juice, I need to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, the teacher has 9 coupons, each giving 100 bottles. So, first, I should calculate the total number of apple juice bottles the teacher can redeem with her coupons. That should be 9 coupons multiplied by 100 bottles per coupon. Let me write that down:

Total bottles from coupons = 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

Wait, that seems right. 9 times 100 is 900. So, the teacher can redeem 900 bottles of apple juice using her coupons.

Now, the teacher gives each student 2 bottles for lunch. There are 29 students, so the total number of bottles given out for lunch is 29 students multiplied by 2 bottles each. Let me calculate that:

Total bottles given out = 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

So, the teacher gives out 58 bottles for lunch. Now, to find out how many bottles she has left, I need to subtract the number of bottles given out from the total number of bottles she had from redeeming the coupons.

So, bottles left = Total bottles from coupons - Total bottles given out.

Plugging in the numbers:

Bottles left = 900 - 58 = ?

Wait, that seems right. Let me do the subtraction. 900 minus 58. Hmm, 900 minus 10 is 890, so minus 58 would be 890 + 2 = 892. So, 900 - 58 = 892.

Therefore, the teacher has 892 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, 9 coupons times 100 bottles each is indeed 900 bottles. Then, 29 students times 2 bottles each is 58 bottles. Subtracting 58 from 900 gives 842? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
