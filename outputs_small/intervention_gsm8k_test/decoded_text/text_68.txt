Q: There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about Dr. Wertz's school, and I need to figure out how many teachers there are. Let me read it again: "There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?" Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if there are 60 girls, the number of boys should be double that. Let me write that down. If G is the number of girls, then B, the number of boys, is 2G. So, substituting the number of girls, B = 2 * 60. Let me calculate that: 2 times 60 is 126. So, there are 126 boys at the school.

Now, the problem also mentions that there are 5 students per teacher. So, I need to find out how many teachers there are based on the total number of students. To do that, I should first find the total number of students in the school. That would be the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls.

So, total students = number of boys + number of girls. Plugging in the numbers, that's 126 + 60. Let me add those together. 126 plus 60 is 186. So, there are 186 students in total.

Now, since there are 5 students per teacher, I can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. So, number of teachers = total students / students per teacher. That would be 186 divided by 5.

Let me do that division. 186 divided by 5. Hmm, 5 goes into 18 three times (because 5*3=15), subtract 15 from 18, you get 3. Bring down the 6, making it 36. 5 goes into 36 seven times (5*7=35), subtract 35 from 36, you get 1. So, 186 divided by 5 is 37.2. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right.
