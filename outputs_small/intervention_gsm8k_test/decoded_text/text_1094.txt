Q: Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem about Ellen playing a prank with her sodas, and I need to figure out the probability that her friend gets sprayed with a soda from a shaken can. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them. Then she takes 1 unshaken soda for herself and leaves. After that, her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. Then Ellen's friend comes along, and we need to find the probability that the friend gets a soda from a shaken can.

Alright, let me list out the steps to keep track of the sodas:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them. So, initially, 3 are shaken, and 9 are unshaken.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, unshaken becomes 9 - 1 = 8.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. So, shaken becomes 3 -1 = 2, and unshaken becomes 8 -2 = 6.
5. Then Ellen's friend comes along. We need to find the probability that the friend gets a shaken soda.

Wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, let's go through each step in detail.

Step 1: Total sodas = 12.

Step2: She shakes 3. So, shaken = 3, unshaken = 9.

Step3: She takes 1 unshaken for herself. So, unshaken = 9 -1 =8. Now, unshaken =8, shaken=3.

Step4: Her brother takes 1 of the shaken and 2 of the unshaken. So, shaken becomes 3 -1=2, and unshaken becomes 8 -2=6. Now, shaken=2, unshaken=6.

So, after these steps, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. We need to find the probability that the friend gets a soda from a shaken can. So, the probability is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

So, number of shaken sodas =2.

Total sodas left =2 +6=8.

Therefore, probability =2/8=1/4=0.25.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25*100=25%.

So, the likelihood is 25%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check.

Starting with 12 sodas.

Shaken:3, unshaken:9.

After Ellen takes 1 unshaken, unshaken=8, shaken=3.

Her brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken. So, shaken=2, unshaken=6.

Total left:2+6=8.

Probability of getting a shaken soda:2/8=1/4=25%.

Yes, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just visualize the process again.

12 sodas:3 shaken,9 unshaken.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken: unshaken=8, shaken=3.

Brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken: shaken=2, unshaken=6.

So, remaining:2 shaken,6 unshaken.

Probability is shaken/sodas=2/8=25%.

Yep, that's solid.

**Final Answer**
The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets a soda from a shaken can is \boxed{25\%}.

Ellen starts with 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken and 9 are unshaken. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas. Her brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. 

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a soda from a shaken can is calculated by dividing the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas left:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with a soda from a shaken can is \boxed{25\%}.
