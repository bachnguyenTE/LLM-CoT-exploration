Q: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Okay, so Steve and Tim are racing to get home from school, and I need to figure out how long the winner will wait, that seems right. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's get the details straight. Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away, and he can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. The question is asking how long the winner will wait, that seems right. So, I think I need to calculate the time each of them takes to get home and then find the difference between those two times.

Alright, so time is equal to distance divided by speed, right? So, I can use that formula for both Steve and Tim. But, that seems right. Let me write that down.

For Steve:
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance is 3 miles, and his speed is 440 feet per minute. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right.
