Q: John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?

Okay, so I have this problem here about John's car breaking down, and I need to figure out how much force he needs to push it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

John's car weighs 1200 pounds, and inside it, he has luggage weighing 250 pounds. He also has two young children, each weighing 75 pounds. The force to move the car is 1% of its weight. I need to find out how much force he needs to push the car.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I think I need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. That means adding up the weight of the car, the luggage, and the two children.

So, the car is 1200 pounds. Then, the luggage is 250 pounds. Each child is 75 pounds, and there are two of them. So, I should calculate the total weight of the luggage and the children first.

Let me write that out:

Total weight = weight of car + weight of luggage + weight of children

So, plugging in the numbers:

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + (75 * 2)

Let me compute that. First, 75 times 2 is 150. Then, adding that to the luggage and the car:

1200 + 250 is... let me see, 1200 + 250. Hmm, 1200 + 200 is 1400, and then +50 is 1450. So, 1450. Then, adding 150 (which is 75*2) gives 1450 + 150. Let me add 1450 + 150. 1450 + 100 is 1550, and then +50 is 1600. Wait, that seems right. So, total weight is 1600 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. 1200 + 250 is 1450, plus 150 is 1600. Yeah, 1600 pounds total.

Now, the force needed to move the car is 1% of its weight. So, I need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.

1% is the same as 0.01 in decimal form. So, 1600 * 0.01.

Let me compute that. 1600 divided by 100 is 16. So, 1600 * 0.01 is 16.

Therefore, the force needed is 16 pounds.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

First, total weight: 1200 + 250 + 75 +75.

1200 + 250 is 1450. 75 +75 is 150. 1450 +150 is 1600. Yep, that's correct.

Then, 1% of 1600 is 16. So, the force is 16 pounds.

Hmm, seems straightforward. Is there any chance I missed something? Let me see.

Wait, that seems right. The problem says the force is 1% of the weight, so 1% of 1600 is 16. So, yeah, 16 pounds is the force needed.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward percentage calculation after adding up all the weights.

So, final answer is 16 pounds.

**Final Answer**
The force needed to push the car is \boxed{16} pounds.

John's car weighs 1200 pounds, and inside it, there is a luggage weighing 250 pounds and two children each weighing 75 pounds. The force to move the car is 1% of its weight.

First, we calculate the total weight of the car and its contents:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + (75 \times 2)
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate 1% of the total weight:
\[
\text{Force} = 1600 \times 0.01
\]
\[
\text{Force} = 16 \
