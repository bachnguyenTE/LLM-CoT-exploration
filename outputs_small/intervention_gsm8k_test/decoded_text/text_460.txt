Q: Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Grayson is recycling cans and bottles and earning money for that. Each week, she gets some money from recycling, and I need to figure out how much she earns in a four-week month. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out how much she earns each week. The problem says that an aluminum can is worth two cents, and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. So, each week, she recycles both cans and bottles. 

She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water each week. So, I need to calculate the earnings from the cans and the earnings from the bottles separately and then add them together for the total weekly earnings.

Let me write that down:

- Earnings from aluminum cans per week: 3 cans * 2 cents per can
- Earnings from plastic bottles per week: 5 bottles * 3 cents per bottle

Then, add those two amounts together to get the total cents earned each week. After that, since the question is about a four-week month, I'll multiply the weekly earnings by four.

Alright, let's compute each part.

Starting with the cans: 3 cans * 2 cents. So, 3 times 2 is 6. So, she earns 6 cents from the aluminum cans each week.

Now, the plastic bottles: 5 bottles * 3 cents. 5 times 3 is 15. So, she earns 15 cents from the plastic bottles each week.

Adding those together: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents. So, Grayson earns 21 cents each week from recycling.

Now, to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, I need to multiply the weekly earnings by 4.

So, 21 cents * 4 weeks. Let me compute that. 21 * 4 is 84. So, 21 * 4 = 84.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, 3 cans at 2 cents each: 3*2=6. Correct.

5 bottles at 3 cents each: 5*3=15. Correct.

Total per week: 6 + 15 = 21. Correct.

Then, 21 * 4: 20*4=80, 1*4=4, so 80+4=84. Correct.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

Wait, that seems right. Let me think again. Each week, she gets 21 cents, so over four weeks, it's 21*4=84. Yeah, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 84 cents.

**Final Answer**
Grayson earns \boxed{84} cents from recycling in a four-week month.
</think>

Grayson recycles cans and bottles and earns money for that. Each week, she recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles. 

- Earnings from aluminum cans per week: \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents}\)
- Earnings from plastic bottles per week: \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\)

Total weekly earnings: \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\)

For a four-week month, the total earnings are: \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\)

\[
\boxed{84}
