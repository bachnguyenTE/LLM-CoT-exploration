Q: Paul is driving a car twice a day: in the morning, and in the afternoon. He did that for 14 days. Each morning ride cost him about $6, and each afternoon ride, about $2. How much money did he spend on driving his car during these two weeks?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here where Paul is driving his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He did this for 14 days. Each morning ride costs him about $6, and each afternoon ride costs about $2. The question is asking how much money he spent on driving his car during these two weeks.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how many times he drives his car in total. Since he drives twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, over 14 days, that should be 2 rides per day multiplied by 14 days. Let me write that down:

Total rides = 2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 rides.

So, he drives his car 28 times in total. Now, each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. So, I need to calculate the total cost for all the morning rides and all the afternoon rides separately and then add them together.

Let me calculate the morning rides first. He drives in the morning 14 times, right? Because he does it once a day for 14 days. So, the cost for the mornings would be:

Morning cost = 14 rides * $6/ride = $84.

Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, for the afternoon rides. He also drives in the afternoon 14 times, once a day for 14 days. So, the cost for the afternoons would be:

Afternoon cost =14 rides * $2/ride = $28.

Wait, that seems right. So, if I add the morning cost and the afternoon cost together, that should give me the total amount he spent on driving his car.

Total cost = Morning cost + Afternoon cost = $84 + $28 = $112.

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 14 days times 2 rides per day is 28 rides total. Then, 14 rides in the morning at $6 each is 14*6. Let me compute that: 10*6=60, 4*6=24, so 60+24=84. That's correct. Then, 14 rides in the afternoon at $2 each is 14*2=28. So, 84+28=112. Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112? Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112? Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112? Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112? Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 84 plus 28 is 112. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 14*6=84, 14*2=28, 84+28=112. So, the total cost is $112.

Wait, that seems right. So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Each day, he spends 6 dollars in the morning and 2 dollars in the afternoon, so each day he spends 6+2=8 dollars. So, over 14 days, he spends 14*8=112 dollars. So, that's another way to think about it. So, 14 days times 8 dollars per day is 112 dollars. So, that's another way to get the same answer.

So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So, that's a good check.

So, both methods give me $112. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is $112.

**Final Answer**
The total amount Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \boxed{112} dollars.

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. 

First, we calculate the total number of rides:
\[
\text{Total rides} = 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the morning rides:
\[
\text{Morning cost} = 14 \text{ rides} \times \$6/\text
