Q: Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Dillon buying some fruits from the store. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges. The prices are given in terms of each other. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon. So, if I let the cost of a pepper be a variable, say 'p', then a watermelon would be 3p, and an orange would be 3p minus 5. That makes sense.

Now, Dillon is going to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The question is asking for the total amount of money he will spend. They also mention that each pepper costs 15$. Wait, that seems right. So, p is 15. So, I can plug that in.

Let me write down the given information:

- Let the cost of a pepper be p = $15.
- Then, the cost of a watermelon is 3p. So, 3 * 15 = $45.
- The cost of an orange is 5 less than a watermelon. So, 45 - 5 = $40.

So, now I know the prices of each fruit:

- Pepper: $15
- Watermelon: $45
- Orange: $40

Now, Dillon is buying:

- 4 watermelons
- 20 peppers
- 10 oranges

I need to calculate the total cost for each type of fruit and then add them all together.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, watermelons: 4 of them at $45 each. So, 4 * 45. Hmm, 4 times 40 is 160, and 4 times 5 is 20, so 160 + 20 = 180. So, watermelons cost $180.

Wait, that seems right. 4 * 45: 45*4 is 180. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, peppers: 20 peppers at $15 each. So, 20 * 15. Hmm, 20*10 is 200, and 20*5 is 100, so 200 + 100 = 300. So, peppers cost $300.

Then, oranges: 10 oranges at $40 each. So, 10 * 40. That's straightforward, 10*40 is 400. So, oranges cost $400.

Now, to find the total amount Dillon will spend, I need to add up the costs of watermelons, peppers, and oranges.

So, total cost = cost of watermelons + cost of peppers + cost of oranges.

Plugging in the numbers:

Total cost = 180 + 300 + 400.

Let me add them step by step.

First, 180 + 300. That's 480.

Then, 480 + 400. That's 880.

So, the total amount Dillon will spend is $880.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the watermelons: 4 * 45. 45*4: 40*4=160, 5*4=20, 160? Wait, that seems right. 45*4 is 180. Wait, that seems right. 45*4 is 180. So, that's correct.

Pears: 20 *15. 20*10=200, 20*5=100, so 200+100=300. Correct.

Oranges: 10*40=400. Correct.

Adding them up: 180 + 300 is 480, plus 400 is 880. Wait, that seems right. 180 + 300 is 480, plus 400 is 920? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right
