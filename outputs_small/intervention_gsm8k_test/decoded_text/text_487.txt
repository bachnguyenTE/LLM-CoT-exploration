Q: Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, determine the total amount of oats needed per meal by multiplying the number of horses by the oats consumed per horse per meal.

Next, calculate the total oats required for a day by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of feeding times per day.

Then, find the total oats needed for five days by multiplying the daily consumption by five.

Finally, determine how many bags are needed by dividing the total oats required by the capacity of one bag and rounding up to the nearest whole number.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total oats consumed per horse per day:**
   
   Each horse eats **5 pounds** of oats per meal.
   
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds/horse/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total oats needed for all four horses per day:**
   
   \[
   4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Find the total oats required for five days:**
   
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine how many bags of 50 pounds each are needed:**
   
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
