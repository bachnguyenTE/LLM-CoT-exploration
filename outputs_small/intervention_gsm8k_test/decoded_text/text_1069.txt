Q: Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Hezekiah and his trucks delivering fertilizer. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these word problems can be a bit tricky, but, that seems right. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. 

He has 20 trucks. Each truck is carrying 20 tons of fertilizer, and the bags are packed. Two hours after the trucks departed, he gets the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched had mechanical failures. So, I need to calculate the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day.

Alright, so let's parse this. He has 20 trucks. Each truck is carrying 20 tons. So, each truck is carrying 20 tons. So, 20 tons per truck. Then, two hours after departure, he gets the news that a quarter of the number of lorries had mechanical failures. So, a quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures because he mentioned lorries. So, that would be 20 trucks, a quarter of them had mechanical failures. So, let me calculate that.

A quarter of 20 is 5. So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures. That means the remaining trucks, which are 20 minus 5, are the ones that successfully delivered the fertilizer. So, 15 trucks delivered the fertilizer on time.

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons. So, 15 trucks times 20 tons per truck. Let me compute that. 15 times 20 is 300. So, 300 tons.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the total tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, 20 trucks, each with 20 tons. So, total fertilizer is 20 times 20, which is 400 tons. But, that seems right. But, that seems right.
