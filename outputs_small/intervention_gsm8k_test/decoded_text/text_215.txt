A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that costs $320.00 and a matching belt that's $32.00. Hmm, let me figure out how much she needs to spend in total. I think I should add the cost of the shoes and the belt together. So, $320.00 plus $32.00. Let me write that down: 320.00 + 32.00. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 320 plus 32 is 352, and then the cents part is 0 + 0, which is 0. So, the total cost is $352.00. Okay, got that down.

Now, Lori works at a part-time job that pays her $8.00 per hour. I need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00. Hmm, so this is a division problem, I think. I need to divide the total amount she needs to earn by her hourly wage.

So, that would be $352.00 divided by $8.00 per hour. Let me write that as a division problem: 352.00 ÷ 8.00. Hmm, I wonder if I can simplify this. Maybe I can eliminate the decimals by multiplying both numbers by 100 to make them whole numbers. So, 352.00 times 100 is 35200, and 8.00 times 100 is 800. So now, the problem becomes 35200 ÷ 800.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 35200 divided by 800. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this further. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by 10. 35200 ÷ 10 is 3520, and 800 ÷10 is 80. So now, it's 3520 ÷ 80. Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but, that seems right. Maybe I can divide both numbers by 4? Let's see: 3520 ÷4 is 880, and 80 ÷4 is 20. So now, it's 880 ÷20. That's easier.

Wait, that seems right. So, 880 divided by 20. Hmm, 20 goes into 880 how many times? Let me think. 20 times 40 is 800, and 20 times 4 is 80, so 40 plus 4 is 44. So, 20 times 44 is 880. So, 880 ÷20 is 44. So, that means 35200 ÷800 is 44. So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn $352.00.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my math. 44 hours times $8 per hour is 44 times 8. 40 times 8 is 320, and 4 times 8 is 32, so 320 plus 32 is 352. So, 44 hours times $8 is $352. So, that matches the total she needs to spend. So, that seems correct.

But, that seems right. So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough for both the shoes and the belt. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, total cost is $352.00, and she makes $8.00 per hour. So, 352 divided by 8 is 44. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, 8 times 44 is 352. So, yeah, that's correct. So, she needs to work 44 hours. So, the answer is 44 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. If she works 44 hours, she'll make 44 times 8, which is 352. So, that's exactly the amount she needs. So, that's correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer. So, Lori needs to work 44 hours.

**Final Answer**
Lori will have to work \boxed{44} hours before she can make her purchase.
