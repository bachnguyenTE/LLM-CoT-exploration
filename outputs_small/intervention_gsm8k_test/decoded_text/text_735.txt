Q: In a student council election, candidate A got 20% of the votes while candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. The rest of the votes was given to candidate C. If there were 100 voters, how many votes did candidate C get?

Okay, so I have this problem about a student council election. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there are 100 voters in total, I can find out how many votes candidate A got by calculating 20% of 100. Hmm, 20% is the same as 0.2 in decimal form, right? So, 0.2 multiplied by 100 should give me the number of votes for candidate A. Let me write that down:

Votes for A = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Okay, so candidate A got 22 votes. Now, candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. Hmm, I need to calculate 55% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes to get candidate B's votes. Let me break that down.

First, find 55% of 22 votes. 55% is the same as 0.55 in decimal. So, 0.55 * 22. Let me compute that. 0.55 times 20 is 11, and 0.55 times 2 is 1.1, so adding those together gives 11 + 1.1 = 12.1. Wait, that seems right. So, 55% of 22 is 11.1? Wait, that seems right. Let me check another way. 10% of 22 is 2.2, so 50% is 5 times that, which is 11. So, 11 + 22 is 33? Wait, that seems right.
