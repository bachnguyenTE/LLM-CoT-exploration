Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that Meredith writes a blog article each day as her permanent job. Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. So, each article is 4 hours. That seems straightforward.

Now, let's look at the number of articles she wrote each day. The problem states that she wrote 5 articles on Monday. Then, on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Hmm, okay, so that means Tuesday's articles are more than Monday's. Let me write that down.

Monday: 5 articles.

Tuesday: 2/5 times more than Monday. So, how do I calculate that? If she wrote 5 articles on Monday, then 2/5 times more would be 5 plus 2/5 of 5. Let me compute that.

First, 2/5 of 5 is (2/5)*5 = 2. So, 2 more articles on Tuesday. So, total articles on Tuesday would be 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

Wait, that seems right. So, Tuesday is 7 articles.

Then, on Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, if Tuesday was 7, then Wednesday is 2*7 = 14 articles.

Let me summarize:

Monday: 5 articles

Tuesday: 7 articles

Wednesday: 14 articles

Now, to find the total number of articles she wrote over the three days, I need to add these up.

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

But, that seems right. 5 on Monday, 7 on Tuesday, 14 on Wednesday. 5+7 is 12, plus 14 is 26. Yeah, that adds up.

But, that seems right. Now, each article takes 4 hours. So, total hours spent writing would be total articles multiplied by 4 hours per article.

So, total hours = 26 * 4.

Wait, that seems right. 26 articles, each taking 4 hours. So, 26*4.

Let me compute that. 20*4 is 80, and 6*4 is 24, so 80 +24=104.

So, total hours spent writing articles is 104 hours.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Monday: 5 articles, 5*4=20 hours.

Tuesday: 7 articles, 7*4=28 hours.

Wednesday:14 articles, 14*4=56 hours.

Total hours:20 +28 +56.

20+28=48, 48+56=104.

Yes, that's correct. So, 104 hours in total.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 104 hours.

But, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the number of articles.

Monday: 5.

Tuesday: 2/5 more than Monday. So, 5 + (2/5)*5=5+2=7. Correct.

Wednesday: twice Tuesday's articles, so 2*7=14. Correct.

Total articles:5+7+14=26. Correct.

Each article is 4 hours, so 26*4=104. Correct.

So, yeah, 104 hours is the total time Meredith spent writing articles over the three days.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that 104 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \boxed{104}.

Meredith writes blog articles each day, with each article taking an average of 4 hours to research and write about. 

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This is calculated as 5 + (2/5)*5 = 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This is calculated as 2*7 = 14 articles.

The total number of articles written over the three days is:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes 4 hours, so the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \
