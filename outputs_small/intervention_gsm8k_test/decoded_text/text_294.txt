Okay, so I have this problem here where Will buys 15 oranges. Then, when he gets home, he asks his two sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest. I need to figure out how many oranges are left unwashed. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. Will has 15 oranges. He tells his two sons to wash as many oranges as their age. So, each son will wash a number of oranges equal to their age. The oldest son is 8, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so that would be 8 divided by 2, which is 4. So, the youngest son is 4 years old and will wash 4 oranges.

Wait, that seems right. So, the two sons are 8 and 4 years old. So, together, they can wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. But, that seems right. So, if they wash 12 oranges, then the number of oranges left unwashed would be the total oranges minus the ones they washed. So, 15 - 12 = 3. So, 3 oranges are left unwashed.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. The oldest son is 8, so he washes 8. The youngest is 4, so he washes 4. 8 + 4 is 12. 15 - 12 is 3. So, 3 oranges are left. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

Wait, that seems right. But, that seems right. Let me think again. Is there any chance that the problem is more complicated? Maybe the number of oranges each son can wash is not equal to their age? Or maybe the problem is about something else?

Wait, that seems right. The problem says, "as many oranges as they are years old." So, each son will wash as many oranges as their age. So, if the oldest son is 8, he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest is 4, so he will wash 4 oranges. So, 8 + 4 =12. So, 15 -12=3. So, 3 oranges left.

Wait, that seems right. So, is the answer 3? Hmm, but, that seems right. Let me think if there's any other way to interpret the problem.

Wait, that seems right. So, the problem is straightforward. So, the answer is 3.

But, that seems right. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. So, the answer is 3.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of oranges left unwashed is \boxed{3}.
</think>

Will buys 15 oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which is 4 years old, so he will wash 4 oranges. Together, they will wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. 

The number of oranges left unwashed is calculated by subtracting the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\).
