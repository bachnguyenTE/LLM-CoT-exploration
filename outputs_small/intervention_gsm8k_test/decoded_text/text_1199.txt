Q: Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?

Okay, so I need to figure out how much root beer is left after all these events and then determine how much each person can drink during the party. Let me break this down step by step.

First, Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer on the first day. That's straightforward. Then, his children come in that evening and drink 4 gallons. So, I should subtract 4 gallons from the initial 24 gallons.

Let me write that down:

24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons remaining.

Wait, that seems right. So after the children drank 4 gallons, there are 20 gallons left.

Next, on the second day, his wife, Barbie, accidentally spills 7 gallons. So, I need to subtract another 7 gallons from the remaining 20 gallons.

20 gallons - 7 gallons = 15 gallons remaining.

Okay, so after Barbie spills 7 gallons, there's 15 gallons left.

Then, on the third day, Ronnie helps himself to the root beer, reducing the amount by 5 gallons. So, I subtract 5 gallons from the current 15 gallons.

15 gallons - 5 gallons = 10 gallons remaining.

Alright, so after Ronnie takes his share, there are 10 gallons left.

Now, on the fourth day, 3 people show up for the party. So, I need to figure out how much each person can drink. The problem says Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally. So, that means the 10 gallons are divided among 4 people.

To find out how much each person gets, I divide 10 gallons by 4.

10 gallons ÷ 4 = 2.5 gallons per person.

Hmm, 2.5 gallons is the same as 2 and a half gallons. So, each person can drink 2.5 gallons during the party.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with 24 gallons, subtract 4, that's 20. Then subtract 7, that's 13. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
