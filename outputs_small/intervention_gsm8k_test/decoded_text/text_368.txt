Q: After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Erin has scored 14 points now, and at that point, her total points are three times more than what Sara has.. Sara scored 8 points. So, I need to find out how many points Erin had before she scored those 14 points.

Wait, that seems right. So, right now, Erin has 14 points, and that's three times more than Sara. But, that seems right. So, Sara has 8 points, and Erin has three times that, which would be 24 points. But, that seems right. So, if Erin now has 24 points, and she scored 14 more points, then before she scored those 14, she must have had 24 minus 14 points.

Let me write that down. Let me denote the number of points Erin had before scoring as E. After scoring 14 points, she has E + 14. According to the problem, E + 14 = 3 * (Sara's points). Sara scored 8, so 3 * 8 is 24. So, E +14 =24. Therefore, E =24 -14, which is 10. So, Erin had 10 points before she scored those 14.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If Erin had 10 points before, and she scores 14 more, she has 24. Sara has 8, and 24 is three times 8, which is 24. So, that checks out. So, the answer should be 10.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. Sometimes, when problems say "three times more," it can be a bit ambiguous. Is it three times as many as Sara, or three times more than Sara? Hmm, in common language, "three times more" can sometimes be interpreted as three times as much as the original. So, if Sara has 8, three times more would be 8 + 3*8=32, but, that seems right.
