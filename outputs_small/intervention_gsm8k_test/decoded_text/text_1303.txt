Q: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?

Okay, so I have this problem here about Nate's dog digging holes and him filling them up. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. 

Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while he's on vacation. When he gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the dog digs for 14 days, and then he starts filling the holes. But, that seems right. So, during those 14 days, the dog is digging holes, and then after he gets home, he starts filling them. But, that seems right. 

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the dog is digging for 14 days, so that's 14 days of digging. Then, when he gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the dog is digging for 14 days, so that's 14 days of digging, and then he starts filling the holes. But, that seems right. 

But, that seems right. So, the dog is digging 6 holes a day for 14 days, so that's 6 multiplied by 14. Let me calculate that. 6 times 14 is 84. So, the dog digs 84 holes during those 14 days. 

Then, when he gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the dog is digging 6 holes a day, and he's filling 9 holes a day. So, the net rate at which the holes are being filled is 9 minus 6, which is 3 holes per day. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the dog is digging 6 holes a day, and he's filling 9 holes a day, so the net gain is 3 holes per day. 

But, that seems right. So, the total number of holes is 84, and he's filling 3 holes a day. So, how many days does it take him to fill all the holes? 

So, 84 holes divided by 3 holes per day is 28 days. So, 28 days of filling. 

But, that seems right. So, the dog digs for 14 days, and then he starts filling for 28 days. So, total time is 14 plus 28, which is 42 days. 

But, that seems right. So, 42 days is how many weeks? Well, 7 days per week, so 42 divided by 7 is 6 weeks. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 weeks. 

But, that seems right. Let me double-check. 

So, the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so 6*14=24 holes. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. So, 6 holes a day for 14 days is 84 holes. Then, he starts filling 9 holes a day, but, that seems right. So, the net rate is 3 holes per day. So, 84 holes divided by 3 holes per day is 28 days. So, 28 days of filling. So, total time is 14 plus 28, which is 42 days. 

42 days divided by 7 is 6 weeks. So, 6 weeks. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 weeks. 

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so 84 holes. Then, he starts filling 9 holes a day, but, that seems right. So, the net rate is 3 holes per day. So, 84 divided by 3 is 28 days. So, 28 days of filling. So, 14 plus 28 is 42 days, which is 6 weeks. 

So, that seems correct. 

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is 6 weeks. 

But, that seems right. So, I think that's the answer. 

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's
