Okay, so John is ordering pizzas to share with his 20 friends, and he wants each friend to have 4 slices. The pizzas are sold in slices, each pizza being cut into 8 portions. Hmm, I need to figure out how many pizzas John needs to order to have enough slices for everyone.

First, let me break down the problem. There are 20 friends, and each friend gets 4 slices. So, the total number of slices needed is 20 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down:

Total slices needed = Number of friends × Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 × 4

Calculating that, 20 times 4 is 80. So, John needs 80 slices in total.

Now, each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. So, each pizza gives 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas he needs, I should divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.

Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed ÷ Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas needed = 80 ÷ 8

Let me compute that. 80 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 10 is 80, so 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, John needs 10 pizzas.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. If each pizza is 8 slices, and he needs 80 slices, then 80 divided by 8 is 10. So, yes, 10 pizzas. That makes sense.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 10 pizzas × 8 slices per pizza is 80 slices. So, 80 slices divided by 4 slices per friend is 20 friends. That matches the given number of friends. So, 10 pizzas is the correct number.

I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the answer should be 10 pizzas.

**Final Answer**
John needs to order \boxed{10} pizzas.

John has 20 friends and wants each friend to have 4 slices of pizza. The pizzas are sold in slices, each pizza being cut into 8 portions. 

First, calculate the total number of slices needed:
\[
\text{Total slices needed} = 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, determine how many pizzas are needed by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[
\text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Thus, John needs to order \boxed{10} pizzas.
