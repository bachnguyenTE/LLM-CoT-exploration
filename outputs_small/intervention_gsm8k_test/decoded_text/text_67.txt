Q: A treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about a treasure hunter who found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There are 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. The question is asking how many of the gems were there in the chest, and the answer is supposed to be in a box, like \boxed{something}. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. There are diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. The number of diamonds is given directly: 175. Then, the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, if diamonds are 175, rubies would be 175 minus 35. Let me write that down.

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
So, rubies = 175 - 35

Let me calculate that. 175 minus 35 is 170. So, there are 170 rubies. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Next, the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, emeralds = 2 * number of rubies. Since we found that rubies are 170, then emeralds would be 2 times 170. Let me compute that.

Number of emeralds = 2 * 170

Hmm, 2 times 170. Let me break that down. 170 is 100 + 70, so 2*100 is 200, and 2*70 is 140. So, 200 + 140 is 360. Wait, that seems right. 170*2 is 340? Wait, that seems right.
