Q: Sarah’s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this question about Sarah's basketball games. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Sarah's basketball games are 4 quarters, each quarter is 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for five minutes. I need to find out how long the entire game lasted.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the game is divided into four quarters. Each quarter is 12 minutes. So, if I just add up the time for each quarter, that should give me the total time without any extensions. Let me write that down.

Each quarter = 12 minutes
Number of quarters = 4

So, total time without extension = 12 minutes/quarter * 4 quarters = 48 minutes.

But, that seems right. 12 times 4 is 48. So, the game was 48 minutes long before any extension. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. 12 minutes times 4 is 48. So, 48 minutes is the original game duration.

But, that seems right. So, the game was 48 minutes long. Then, in the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for five minutes. So, that means, in the last quarter, instead of the game going to the other team, it was extended by five minutes.

So, does that mean that the last quarter was 12 minutes plus 5 minutes? Or is it that the entire game was extended by five minutes?

Wait, that seems right. So, the game was originally 48 minutes, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the game was 48 minutes, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
