Q: Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, and a gallon of water costs $0.15. How much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that Gary does laundry twice a week. Hmm, so how many times does he do laundry in a week? Well, twice. So, in one week, he does two loads. But, that seems right. I mean, a week is seven days, so doing laundry twice a week would be 2 times 7, which is 14 times a week. Wait, that seems right. So, 14 times a week.

Now, each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. Wait, that seems right. 20 gallons is 20, so 20? No, wait, that seems right. 20 gallons is 20? No, wait, that seems right. 20 gallons is 20 gallons. So, each load is 20 gallons. So, each time he does laundry, he uses 20 gallons. So, 20 gallons per load.

So, how much water does he use each week? Well, he does 14 times a week, each time using 20 gallons. So, 14 times 20 gallons. Let me calculate that. 14 multiplied by 20. Hmm, 14 times 20. Let me think. 10 times 20 is 200, and 4 times 20 is 80, so 200 plus 80 is 300. Wait, that seems right. So, 14 times 20 is 336 gallons per week.

Wait, that seems right. 14 times 20 is 336. So, 336 gallons per week. So, that's the amount of water he uses each week.

Now, how many weeks are in a year? Well, a year is 52 weeks, right? Because 52 weeks is 52 times 7, which is 364 days, which is about a year. So, 52 weeks in a year.

So, to find out how much he spends on water in a year, I need to multiply the weekly water usage by the number of weeks in a year. So, 336 gallons per week times 52 weeks. Let me calculate that.

336 times 52. Well, 336 times 5 is 1680, and 336 times 2 is 672. So, adding those together, 1680 plus 672 is 2352. So, 2352 gallons of water per year.

Wait, that seems right. 336 times 52 is 2352. So, 2352 gallons of water per year.

Now, the question is, how much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year? So, we need to find the cost. We know that a gallon of water costs $0.15. So, we need to multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon.

So, 2352 gallons times $0.15 per gallon. Let me calculate that. 2352 times 0.15. Hmm, let's break that down. 2352 times 0.1 is 235.2, and 2352 times 0.05 is 117.6. So, adding those together, 235.2 plus 117.6 is 352.8.

So, 2352 times 0.15 is 352.8. So, that's $352.80 per year.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. 2352 times 0.15. Alternatively, 2352 times 15 is 35280, and then divide by 100, which is 352.8. Yeah, that's correct.

So, the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is $352.80.

But, that seems right. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. So, 2 times 7 is 14 times a week. Each load is 20 gallons, so 14 times 20 is 336 gallons per week. 336 times 52 weeks is 2352 gallons per year. 2352 gallons times $0.15 per gallon is 352.8
