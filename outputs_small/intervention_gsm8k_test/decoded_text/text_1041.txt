Okay, so I need to figure out how much Molly will pay for catering. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Molly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. Out of these, 10 people want chicken salad, and 6 people want pasta salad. The chicken salad costs $6.50 per person, and the pasta salad is $6 per person. I need to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, there are 16 people invited, but, that seems right. Out of these, 10 want chicken salad and 6 want pasta. Wait, that seems right. 10 plus 6 is 16, so that adds up. So, 10 people are having chicken salad, and 6 are having pasta. So, the rest, which is 16 minus 10 minus 6, that's 0 people, maybe they want something else? But, that seems right. So, the total number of people is 16, and the amounts for each salad are given.

So, the chicken salad is $6.50 per person, and the pasta salad is $6 per person. So, I need to calculate the total cost for each type of salad and then add them together to get the total amount Molly will pay.

Let me write this down step by step.

First, calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people wanting it, and each person's meal is $6.50. So, the total cost for chicken salad would be 10 multiplied by $6.50.

Similarly, for the pasta salad, there are 6 people, each paying $6. So, the total cost for pasta salad is 6 multiplied by $6.

Then, add both totals together to get the overall total cost.

Let me compute each part.

Starting with the chicken salad: 10 people times $6.50 per person.

So, 10 * 6.50. Let me calculate that. 10 times 6 is 60, and 10 times 0.50 is 5. So, 60 + 5 is 65. So, $65.00 for the chicken salad.

Wait, that seems right. 10 times 6.50 is 65.00.

Now, the pasta salad: 6 people times $6 per person.

So, 6 * 6 is 36. So, $36.000 for the pasta salad.

Now, to find the total amount, I need to add the two amounts together: $65.00 + $36.00.

Adding those together: 65 + 36 is 101. So, $101.00.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount Molly will pay is $101.00.

But, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Chicken salad: 10 people * $6.50 = $65.00. That's correct.

Pasta salad: 6 people * $6 = $36.00. That's correct.

Total: $65 + $36 = $101.00. That seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, the total amount is $101.00.

But, that seems right. Let me think again. 10 people at $6.50 is 10*6.50. Let me compute 10*6.50 another way. 10*6 is 60, 10*0.50 is 5.20. Wait, that seems right. 60 + 5.20 is 71.20? Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems
