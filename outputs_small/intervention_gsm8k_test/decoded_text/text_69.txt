Q: Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Bailey start with?

Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out how much money Bailey started with. Let me read it again: "Bailey starts with a certain amount of money. Then she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Bailey start with?" Hmm, wait, that seems right. Let me make sure I got that correctly.

Alright, so she starts with some amount, let's call that amount "x." Then, each week she gets $5 for 8 weeks. So, over 8 weeks, she receives 8 times $5. And after all that, she has a total of $100. So, I need to find out what x was.

Let me write that down as an equation. So, her total money is her initial amount plus the money she earned over the 8 weeks. So, that would be x plus 8 times 5 equals 100. Let me write that:

x + 8 * 5 = 100

Okay, so simplifying that, 8 times 5 is 40. So, the equation becomes:

x + 40 = 100

Now, to find x, I need to subtract 40 from both sides. So, subtracting 40 from both sides:

x = 100 - 40

Let me do that subtraction. 100 minus 40 is... 60? Wait, that seems right. 100 minus 40 is 66. So, x is 66.

Wait, that seems right. Let me check my work again. So, if she started with $66, then she earned $5 each week for 8 weeks, which is 8*5=40. So, 66 + 40 is 106. Wait, that seems right.
