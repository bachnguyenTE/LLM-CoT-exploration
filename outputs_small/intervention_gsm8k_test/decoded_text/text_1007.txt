Q: Two friends are playing pick-up sticks. While playing, they noticed that there are 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue sticks than red. Also, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. How many sticks do they have?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
First, identify the number of red sticks, which is 9.

Next, determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, calculate 9 + 5 to get 14 blue sticks.

Then, find the number of yellow sticks. There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so subtract 3 from 14 to get 11 yellow stick.

Finally, add up all the sticks: 9 red + 14 blue +1 yellow equals 24 sticks in total.

Let's determine the total number of sticks step by step.

1. **Number of Red Sticks:**
   \[
   \text{Red Sticks} = 9
   \]

2. **Number of Blue Sticks:**
   \[
   \text{Blue Sticks} = \text{Red Sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Number of Yellow Sticks:**
   \[
   \text{Yellow Sticks} = \text{Blue Sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Sticks} = \text{Red Sticks} + \text{Blue Sticks} + \text{Yellow Sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
