Q: Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here about cars for rent. Let me read it again: There are 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic. The question is asking, what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic? Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to figure out how many semi-automatic cars there are. The total number of cars is 20, right? So, if 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, I can subtract those from the total to find out how many are semi-automatic. Let me write that down.

Total cars = 20  
Automatic cars = 12  
Manual cars = 4  
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars

So plugging in the numbers:  
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4

Let me do the subtraction. 20 minus 12 is 10, and then 10 minus 4 is 6. So, there are 6 semi-automatic cars. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic. To find a percentage, I know I need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Let me write that formula.

Percentage = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) × 100

Plugging in the numbers:  
Percentage = (6 / 20) × 100

Hmm, let me compute 6 divided by 20 first. 6 divided by 20 is the same as 6/20. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so dividing both by 2 gives me 3/10. So, 3 divided by 10 is 0.3. Wait, that seems right. 3 divided by 10 is 0.3, so 6 divided by 20 is also 0.3.

Now, multiplying that by 100 to get the percentage: 0.3 × 100. Let me do that multiplication. 0.3 times 100 is 30. So, 0.3 × 100 is 30. So, the percentage is 30%.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 120 total cars, 12 automatic, 4 manual, so 12 + 4 is 16, and 20 minus 16 is 4.
