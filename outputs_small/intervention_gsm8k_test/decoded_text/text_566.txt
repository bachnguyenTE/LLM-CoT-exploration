Q: Shiloh is 44 years old today.  In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew.  How old is his nephew today?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: Shiloh is 44 years old today. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. How old is his nephew today? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old. The problem says that in 7 years, his age will be three times his nephew's age at that time. So, I need to find out how old his nephew is today.

Let me denote the nephew's current age as N. That seems like a good starting point. So, in 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 years old, right? Let me calculate that: 44 + 7 is 51. Wait, that seems right. So, Shiloh will be 51 years old in 7 years.

Now, according to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So, if the nephew is N years old now, in 7 years he will be N + 7 years old. So, the equation should be:

51 = 3 * (N + 7)

Hmm, okay, so I can set up that equation. Let me write that down:

51 = 3(N + 7)

Wait, that seems right. 44 + 7 is 51, so 51 equals 3 times (N + 7). Now, I need to solve for N.

First, I can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the 3 on the right side. So, dividing both sides by 3:

51 / 3 = N + 7

Calculating 51 divided by 3. Hmm, 3 goes into 5 once with a remainder of 2, then bring down the 1 to make 21. 3 goes into 21 seven times because 3*7 is 21. So, 51 divided by 3 is 17. So, 17 = N + 7.

Now, to find N, I need to subtract 7 from both sides:

17 - 7 = N

Which simplifies to:

10 = N

So, N is 10. That means the nephew is currently 10 years old.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Shiloh is 44 now. In 7 years, he'll be 51. The nephew is 10 now, so in 7 years, he'll be 17. Is 51 equal to three times 17? Let's see: 3*17 is 51. Yes, that's correct.

So, my answer is that the nephew is 10 years old today.

I think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using different variables or another method, just to confirm.

Alternatively, I could let the nephew's age in 7 years be x. Then, Shiloh's age in 7 years is 3x. But, that seems right. So, Shiloh's current age is 44, so in 7 years, he'll be 51. So, 51 = 3x. Then, x = 51 / 3 = 17. So, the nephew's age in 7 years is 17, which means he is 17 - 7 = 10 today. Yep, same result.

So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is 10. So, I feel confident that the nephew is 10 years old today.

Just to recap:

- Shiloh is 44 now.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be 51.
- At that time, Shiloh's age is three times the nephew's age.
- So, 51 = 3*(N +7)
- Solving gives N =10.

Yep, that all adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward once I set up the equation correctly.

I wonder if there's a way to visualize this problem. Maybe using a timeline or something. Let's see.

Imagine a timeline where the current time is 0. Shiloh is at 44, and the nephew is at N. In 7 years, Shiloh will be at 51, and the nephew will be at N +7. According to the problem, 51 is three times N +7. So, 51 = 3*(N +7). That's the same equation as before.
