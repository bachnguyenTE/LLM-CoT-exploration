Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I know penguins are different from other birds because they're flightless, but I'm not entirely sure about their flight capabilities. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should consider what makes a bird fly. From what I remember, birds have feathers, which help them fly by generating lift. Penguins also have feathers, but I think they're different. They have a thick, feathery skin, which might be similar to how birds fly. So maybe they can fly too.

But wait, I've heard that penguins aren't as active as other birds. They live in icebergs and really enjoy resting. I wonder if their flight is more of an activity for their winter. Maybe they don't fly during the day but just hover in the air when needed.

I also recall that some birds can fly, like eagles and owls. Penguins, being flightless, probably don't fly actively. Maybe they just hover in the air when they're near icebergs. That makes sense because flight is more of a winter activity for them.

So, putting it all together, penguins don't fly actively during the day. Their flight is more of a resting and hovering activity. Therefore, I think the answer is NO.
