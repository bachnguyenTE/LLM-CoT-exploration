Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know penguins are really unique because they're the only birds that live entirely in the ice. But does that mean they can fly? I'm not sure. Maybe I should start by thinking about what I know about penguins. Penguins have a streamlined body shape, which helps them float in water. They also use their beaks to flap their wings to fly. I've heard they can dive to swim quickly, but can they actually fly on their own? 

I remember reading somewhere that penguins can swim really fast, maybe up to 15 miles per hour, but I don't think they can fly. They need to dive into the water to do that, so maybe they don't have the wings to fly on their own. But wait, I also heard that some species can fly, like the Gentoo penguin, but that's a specific case. Maybe penguins aren't as versatile as that.

I should also think about how flight works. For most birds, flight requires翅膀. Penguins don't have wings, so they can't generate lift on their own. Their ability to fly must depend on something else, like using their bodies to generate lift, which they do by flapping their wings. But that's for diving, not regular flight.

So, putting it all together, penguins don't fly on their own. They can't generate lift without wings, and they don't have wings. Their ability to fly is more about diving into the water rather than flying. Therefore, the answer should be "NO."
