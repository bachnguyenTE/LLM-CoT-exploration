Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, but I'm not entirely sure about their flight capabilities. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that birds can fly, so penguins, being birds, should be able to fly. But I want to be sure. Maybe I should look into how penguins fly. Penguins are known for their fast and efficient swimming, which is their natural flight mode. So, they don't fly like birds do in the traditional sense, but they do fly.

I think they can fly in the air, but maybe not as high as some other birds. I've heard they can fly for long distances. Maybe they can even fly in the sky. I should check if they can fly without wings. Oh, right, they don't have wings, so they fly by flapping their bodies.

Wait, do penguins use wings? I think they do, but it's a lot like bird wings. They flap them to create lift, but they don't fly through the air in the same way as other birds. They also swim underwater, which is their natural flight mode.

I should also consider if there are any exceptions or reasons they can't fly. I don't recall any reasons penguins can't fly. They're pretty common and flight is a skill that's maintained through training and observation.

So putting it all together, penguins fly because they can flap their bodies, swim, and use their unique aerial behavior. They don't need wings like other birds, so they can fly without them. Therefore, the answer should be "YES."
