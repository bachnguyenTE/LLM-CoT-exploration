Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic facts about penguins. They're really big, right? Like, much bigger than other birds. I think they have long necks, which I associate with flight. But does that mean they can fly?

Wait, flight typically requires some kind of movement, like flapping wings or using a propeller. Penguins have wings, but are they powered? I think they use their body as a sort of wing, but I'm not sure if that's enough to make them fly. Maybe they can't fly on their own, but can they fly with help from water?

I remember seeing pictures where penguins are floating in the water. That makes me think they can fly, but I'm not sure if it's on their own or with assistance. Maybe they can fly with the current or something. I think some birds can fly with water, like some ducks or geese, but penguins are different because they don't have legs.

I should also consider the environment. Penguins live in cold, icy waters, so maybe their flight is more about swimming than flying. But I've seen some penguins flying in the air, so perhaps they have a different method of flight.

I'm a bit confused now. Should I say "NO" because they can't fly on their own and maybe "YES" because they can fly with help? Or is there a definitive answer I'm missing? Maybe I should look up some sources to confirm. But since I don't have access to the internet right now, I'll have to rely on what I remember.

Another angle: flight in birds is usually powered, like with wings or flapping. Penguins have wings but they don't flap; they use their body. So, maybe they can't fly on their own. But they can fly with the current, which is a form of assistance. So, in a way, they can fly, but it's not powered by wings.

I think the answer is "NO" because they can't fly on their own, but they can fly with help. But I'm not entirely sure. I should probably stick with "NO" since flight typically requires wings or flapping, and penguins don't flap.
