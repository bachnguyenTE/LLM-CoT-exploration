Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know a little about penguins from school, but I'm not an expert. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that penguins are birds, but they don't fly like some other birds. They swim instead. So maybe they don't fly at all. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe they do fly for some reason.

I think about how birds fly. Birds have wings, right? So they generate lift by moving air backward. Penguins don't have wings, so that might be the reason they can't fly. But I'm not 100% certain.

I also recall that penguins are pretty tall and have a streamlined body. Maybe that helps them fly. But I'm not sure how much they actually fly. I think they can swim, but is there a way they can fly?

I wonder if there's a study or something that says penguins can fly. I think they can fly, but maybe only for short periods. I've heard penguins can dive underwater and then fly, but is that considered flying?

I should also consider if there are any animals similar to penguins that do fly. I know some birds, like the hummingbird, can fly, but they don't look like penguins. Maybe that's why I'm confused.

I think penguins are classified as flightless birds, so they don't fly naturally. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some information to confirm.

Wait, I think I've read that penguins can fly, but only for short periods. They can swim, then fly, but not continuously. So maybe the answer is "NO" because they don't fly regularly, but "YES" because they can fly for a short time.

I'm not entirely certain, but I think the main answer is that penguins can fly, but not continuously. So, the answer would be "NO" to the question of whether penguins can fly regularly, but "YES" because they can fly for some time.
