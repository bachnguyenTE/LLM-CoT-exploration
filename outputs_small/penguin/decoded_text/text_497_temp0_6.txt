Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, so I'll need to break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that penguins are birds, similar to ducks and eagles. I think they're known for being flightless, so maybe they can't fly. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about what I know about birds in general. Most birds can fly, right? They have wings, so they can move through the air. Penguins, being birds, should have wings too, which would allow them to fly. 

Wait, but I also heard something about penguins being flightless. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe it's because they have a different type of wing or they're adapted to water. Oh, right! Penguins live in water, so they don't have the same kind of wings as birds that fly through the air. They have hydro翼, which are specialized fins that help them swim efficiently in water. So, even though they're birds, their wings are adapted for water, not air. 

So, that means they can't fly like birds do. They can swim and fly in water but not through the sky. That makes sense. I should also consider if there's any evidence or studies that support this. Maybe some research or news articles. I think penguins do fly, but it's not through the sky; it's through the water. So, they can fly, but not vertically. 

Putting it all together, penguins can fly using their hydro翼, which allows them to swim and fly in water but not through the air. So, the answer is no, they can't fly vertically, but they can fly in water. I'm pretty sure that's correct, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any facts.
