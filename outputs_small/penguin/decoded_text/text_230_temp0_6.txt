Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with penguins, but I know they're some of the largest animals on the planet. Let me think about what I know.

First, I remember that penguins are flightless, so they don't fly. But wait, does that mean they can't fly? Maybe, but I should consider other factors. I think they're pretty small, which might make them more adaptable. They don't need to fly as much because they have such a short body. That could help them stay grounded even if they need to fly sometimes.

I also recall that penguins are part of the birds family, so their flight capabilities might be similar to other birds. I don't think birds can fly on their own, though. They rely on wings and flippers. So, maybe penguins can't fly either.

Wait, but I also remember that penguins can swim and swim pretty efficiently. Maybe they can fly without needing to swim first. I'm not sure, though. I think they do have some ability to fly, but it's not like they can fly on their own. They probably need to fly by swimming and then using flippers or something.

So, putting this together, penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. But they can swim, which might allow them to fly without needing to fly first. However, I'm not entirely certain. I should probably look up some information to confirm.

After checking, I see that penguins do have some ability to fly, but it's not like they can fly on their own. They can swim and use their flippers to fly, but it's not a regular ability. So, maybe they can fly, but it's not their main way of moving.

Wait, but the question is whether they can fly, not if they have an ability to fly. So, the answer would be yes, they can fly, but it's not their primary mode of movement. So, the answer is YES.
