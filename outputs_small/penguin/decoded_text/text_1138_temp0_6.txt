Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I remember from school that penguins are birds, but I'm not entirely sure if they can fly. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that birds usually fly, but maybe penguins have some unique features that make them different. I think penguins are small and have a streamlined body shape. I've heard they're pretty efficient swimmers, which probably helps them fly better because they don't have to swim as much as some other birds.

Wait, I also remember something about penguins not having wings. Oh yeah, they don't fly like humans or cows. That makes sense because their streamlined bodies allow them to glide through the air without needing to flit. So they don't have wings to flap; instead, they swim and then use their bodies to fly.

I should also consider their habitat. Penguins live in icy waters, so they rely on their bodies to stay warm and maneuver in the cold. They don't use traditional wings like birds do, so their flight is entirely through swimming and flapping their beak to flap their wings.

So putting it all together, penguins don't have wings to fly like humans or other birds. They don't swim enough to create lift, which is what birds rely on for flight. Therefore, they can't fly.
