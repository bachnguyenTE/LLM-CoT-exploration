**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of **blue gumballs**.
   - Let \( P \) represent the number of **pink gumballs**.

2. **Given Information:**
   - There are **12 blue gumballs**.
   - There are **22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs** compared to blue gumballs.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The number of pink gumballs is **22 more than four times** the number of blue gumballs.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 4B + 22
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   - We know that \( B = 12 \).
   - Substitute \( B \) into the equation:
     \[
     P = 4(12) + 22
     \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Pink Gumballs:**
   - First, multiply 4 by 12:
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48
     \]
   - Then, add 22 to the result:
     \[
     48 + 22 = 70
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - There are **70 pink gumballs**.

**Answer:** \(\boxed{70}\)
