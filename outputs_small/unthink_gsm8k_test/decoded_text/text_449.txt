**Solution:**

Beatrice bought a total of 10 packets of crayons. 

- **Six packets** had 8 pieces of colors each:
  \[
  6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces}
  \]
  
- **Four packets** had 16 pieces of colors each:
  \[
  4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces}
  \]

**Total number of crayons:**
\[
48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Answer:** Beatrice bought a total of \(\boxed{112}\) colors of crayons.
