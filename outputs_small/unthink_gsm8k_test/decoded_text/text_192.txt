Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many trees Tom has left after 10 years.

**Initial Setup:**
- **Starting Trees:** 50 trees

**Yearly Changes:**
1. **Planting:** Tom plants 10 trees every year.
2. **Chopping Down:** Tom chops down 2 trees every year.

**Net Change per Year:**
- **Net Planting:** \(10 \text{ trees} - 2 \text{ trees} = 8 \text{ trees}\) added each year.

**Total Trees Over 10 Years:**
- **Year 1:**
  - Starting Trees: 50
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(50 + 8 = 63\)
  
- **Year 2:**
  - Starting Trees: 63
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(63 + 8 = 71\)
  
- **Year 3:**
  - Starting Trees: 71
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(71 + 8 = 79\)
  
- **Year 4:**
  - Starting Trees: 79
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(79 + 8 = 87\)
  
- **Year 5:**
  - Starting Trees: 87
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(87 + 8 = 95\)
  
- **Year 6:**
  - Starting Trees: 95
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(95 + 8 = 103\)
  
- **Year 7:**
  - Starting Trees: 103
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(103 + 8 = 111\)
  
- **Year 8:**
  - Starting Trees: 111
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(111 + 8 = 119\)
  
- **Year 9:**
  - Starting Trees: 119
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(119 + 8 = 127\)
  
- **Year 10:**
  - Starting Trees: 127
  - Net Change: +8
  - Total Trees: \(127 + 8 = 135\)

**Additional Note:**
- **30% of the trees die.**
  
- **Total Trees After 10 Years Before Death:**
  - \(135 \text{ trees}\)
  
- **30% Die:**
  - **Number of Trees That Die:** \(0.30 \times 135 = 40.5\)
  
  - **Since we can't have half a tree, we'll consider 40 trees die.**
  
- **Remaining Trees:**
  - \(135 - 40 = 95 \text{ trees}\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{95}
\]
