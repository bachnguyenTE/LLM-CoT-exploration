**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost of the toy car:**
   
   The toy car costs **\$12**.

2. **Subtract the amount the child already has:**
   
   He has **\$4** saved.
   
   \[
   \$12 - \$4 = \$8
   \]
   
   So, he needs **\$8** more.

3. **Calculate how many days he needs to save the remaining amount:**
   
   He plans to save **\$2** each day.
   
   \[
   \frac{\$8}{\$2 \text{ per day}} = 4 \text{ days}
   \]
   
4. **Final Answer:**
   
   It will take him **4 days** to save the remaining amount.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
