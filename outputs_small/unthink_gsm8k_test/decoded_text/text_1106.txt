**Solution:**

Marty has **100 centimeters** of ribbon.

1. **First Cut:**
   - He needs to divide the ribbon into **4 equal parts.**
   - **Length of each part:**  
     \[
     \frac{100\,000\text{ cm}}{4} = 25,000\text{ cm}
     \]
   
2. **Second Cut:**
   - Each of these **4 parts** is then divided into **5 equal parts.**
   - **Length of each final part:**  
     \[
     \frac{25,000\text{ cm}}{5} = 5,000\text{ cm}
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
Each final cut will be **5.00 centimeters** long.
