Q: An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so:
     \[
     \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4}F
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. The remaining flights are:
     \[
     F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F
     \]
     Since these are split equally:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F \div 2 = \frac{1}{8}F
     \]
     \[
     \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{8}F
     \]
   
2. **Second Plane:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes **44** trips.
   - According to the problem, these 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day:
     \[
     44 = \frac{1}{2}F
     \]
   
3. **Solve for \( F \):**
   \[
   44 = \frac{1}{2}F \implies F = 44 \times 2 = 88
   \]
   
4. **Calculate Flights to France:**
   \[
   \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}F = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
