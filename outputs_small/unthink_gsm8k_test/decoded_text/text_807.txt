To determine how long Milo can make his mosaic, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of glass chips needed per square inch:**
   - **12 glass chips = 1 square inch**

2. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - **2 bags × 72 chips per bag = 144 chips**

3. **Find out how many square inches the mosaic can cover with 144 chips:**
   - **144 chips ÷ 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches**

4. **Determine the length of the mosaic:**
   - **Milo wants the mosaic to be 3 inches tall.**
   - **Length = Total area ÷ Height**
   - **Length = 12 square inches ÷ 3 inches = 4 inches**

**Final Answer:**  
Milo can make his mosaic **4 inches long**.
