Q: Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia. If Arelia has $120, how much would each have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Arelia has.
   - According to the problem, Arelia has \$120. So, \( A = 120 \).

2. **Express Other People's Amounts in Terms of A:**
   - **Kassidy:** Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia.
     \[
     K = \frac{3}{4}A
     \]
   - **Rayna:** Rayna has \$60 more than Kassidy.
     \[
     R = K + 60 = \frac{3}{4}A + 60
     \]

3. **Substitute the Value of A:**
   - Since \( A = 120 \),
     \[
     K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
     \]
     \[
     R = 90 + 60 = 156
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = A + K + R = 120 + 90 + 156 = 366
   \]

5. **Determine the Equal Share:**
   - There are 4 people (Arelia, Kassidy, Rayna, and presumably another person, but the problem doesn't mention a fourth person).
   - Since the problem mentions "them," and we have four people, we'll divide the total equally among them.
     \[
     \text{Equal Share} = \frac{366}{4} = 91.5
     \]
     - However, typically money is in whole dollars, so it might be \$91.50, but since the problem doesn't specify, we'll keep it as \$91.50.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{91.50}
\]
