To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, follow these steps:

1. **List the highest temperatures:**
   - Southlandia: -48°F
   - Northlandia: 21°F
   - Midlandia: -3°F

2. **Add the temperatures together:**

   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -24°F
   \]

3. **Divide the sum by the number of countries (3):**
   \[
   \frac{-24}{3} = -8°F
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The average highest temperature of these three countries is \boxed{-8} degrees Fahrenheit.
