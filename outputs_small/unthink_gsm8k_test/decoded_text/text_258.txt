**Solution:**

Nancy owes the library money for returning books that are overdue. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Cost per book:** \$0.50 (50 cents) per book.
2. **Number of books:** 8 books.
3. **Overdue fee:** A flat fee of \$2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

**Calculations:**

1. **Total cost for overdue books:**
   \[
   8 \text{ books} \times \$0.50/\text{book} = \$4.00
   \]
   
2. **Total amount to pay:**
   \[
   \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$6.00}
\]
