**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of males and females:**
   - **Males:** 8 (including Larry)
   - **Females:** 6

2. **Determine the dumpling consumption:**
   - Each female ate **3 dumplings**.
   - Each male ate **1 more dumpling** than each female.

3. **Calculate dumplings eaten by males:**
   - Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female:
     \[
     \text{Dumplings per male} = 3 + 1 = 4
     \]

4. **Calculate total dumplings eaten by females:**
   - Number of females: 6
   - Dumplings per female: 3
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings for females} = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

5. **Calculate total dumplings eaten by males:**
   - Number of males: 8
   - Dumplings per male: 4
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings for males} =8 \times 4 = 32
   \]

6. **Calculate the total dumplings cooked:**
   - Add the dumplings eaten by males and females:
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings} = 32 + 18 = 50
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
