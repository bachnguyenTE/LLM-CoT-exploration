Q: John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Tree Height:**  
   The tree is **80 feet** tall.

2. **Logs from the Tree:**  
   John can make **80%** of the tree's height into logs.  
   \[
   \text{Logs} = 80\% \times 80\ \text{feet} = 0.8 \times 80 = 64\ \text{feet}
   \]

3. **Number of 4-Foot Logs:**  
   Each log is **4 feet** long.  
   \[
   \text{Number of Logs} = \frac{64\ \text{feet}}{4\ \text{feet/log}} = 16\ \text{logs}
   \]

4. **Planks from Logs:**  
   From each log, John cuts **5 planks**.  
   \[
   \text{Total Planks} = 16\ \text{logs} \times 5\ \text{planks/log} = 80\ \text{planks}
   \]

5. **Revenue from Planks:**  
   Each plank is sold for **\$1.2**.  
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 80\ \text{planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
John makes a total of \(\boxed{\$96}\).
