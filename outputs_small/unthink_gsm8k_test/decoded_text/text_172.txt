Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total age of the four birds.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - **Sally Four** is the same age as **Sally Thirtytwo**.
   - **Sally Thirtytwo** is **8 years old**.

2. **Determine Sally Four's age:**
   - Since **Sally Thirtytwo** is **8 years old** and they are the same age, **Sally Four** is also **8 years old**.

3. **Find Granny Red's age:**
   - Granny Red is **two times as old** as **Sally Four**.
   - **Granny Red's age** = 2 × **Sally Four's age** = 2 × 8 = **16 years old**.

4. **Determine Sally Two's age:**
   - Sally Two is **three years older** than **Granny Red**.
   - **Sally Two's age** = **Granny Red's age** + 3 = 16 + 3 = **19 years old**.

5. **Calculate the total age of all four birds:**
   - **Sally Four** = 8 years
   - **Sally Thirtytwo** = 8 years
   - **Granny Red** = 16 years
   - **Sally Two** = 19 years

   **Total Age** = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = **41 years**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{41}\)
