**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - Martha's cat is **5 times faster** than her turtle.
   - The **cat's speed** is given as **15 feet per second (ft/s)**.

2. **Determining the Turtle's Speed:**
   - If the cat is 5 times faster, then the turtle's speed is:
     \[
     \text{turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ ft/s}}{5} = 3 \text{ ft/s}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Distance the Turtle Can crawl in 40 Seconds:**
   - **Distance** is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ ft/s} \times 40 \text{ s} = 120 \text{ feet}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{120 \text{ feet}}
\]
