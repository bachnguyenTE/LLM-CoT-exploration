**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:**
   
   - **Number of weeks:** 6 weeks
   - **Sessions per week:** 2 sessions
   - **Duration per session:** 2 hours

   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} \times \text{Duration per session} = 6 \times 2 \times 2 = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   - **Cost per hour:** \$125

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Cost per hour} = 24 \times 125 = \$3,\!000
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$3,\!300}
\]
