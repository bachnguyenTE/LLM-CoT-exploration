Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Farmer Brown has a total of **60 animals** on his farm.
- All animals are either **chickens** or **cows**.
- The number of **chickens** is **twice** the number of **cows**.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( C \) represent the number of **cows**.
- Then, the number of **chickens** would be \( 2C \) (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).

**Total number of animals:**
\[
C + 2C = 3C
\]
According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60:
\[
3C = 60
\]
**Solving for \( C \):**
\[
C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]
So, there are **20 cows**.

**Number of chickens:**
\[
2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]
So, there are **40 chickens**.

**Total number of legs:**
- Each **cow** has **4 legs**.
- Each **chicken** has **2 legs**.

\[
\text{Total legs} = (20 \times 4) + (40 \times 2) = 80 + 80 = 168
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
