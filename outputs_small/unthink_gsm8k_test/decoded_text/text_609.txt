**Solution:**

To determine how many pounds of butter Juan needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Butter per dozen croissants:**
   - It takes **1/4** pound of butter to make **1 dozen croissants**.

2. **Number of dozens Juan wants to make per day:**
   - Juan wants to make **4 dozen croissants** a day.

3. **Butter needed per day:**
   - Multiply the amount of butter per dozen by the number of dozens:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} \times 4 \text{ dozen/day} = 1 \text{ pound/day}
     \]

4. **Number of days:**
   - He wants to make these croissants for **1 week** (7 days).

5. **Total butter needed for the week:**
   - Multiply the daily butter requirement by the number of days:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
