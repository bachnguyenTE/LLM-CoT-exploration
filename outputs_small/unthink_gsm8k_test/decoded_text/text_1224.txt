Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Monday's Rainfall:** 2 inches
- **Tuesday's Rainfall:** Expected to be 1 inch more than twice Monday’s total.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( M \) represent Monday's rainfall.
- Let \( T \) represent Tuesday's rainfall.

**Step 1: Calculate Monday's Rainfall**
\[
M = 2 \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 2: Express Tuesday's Rainfall in Terms of Monday's Rainfall**
According to the problem:
\[
T = 2 \times M + 1
\]

**Step3: Substitute Monday's Rainfall into the Equation**
\[
T = 2 \times 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ inches}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ inches}}
\]
