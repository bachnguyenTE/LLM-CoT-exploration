**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Pizzas:**
   - Four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of **\$64**.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas:**
   - Two of the pizzas cost **\$30**.

3. **Cost of the Remaining Two Pizzas:**
   - Since there are four pizzas in total and two of them cost **\$30**, the remaining two pizzas must also cost the same amount.
   - Let’s denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as **x**.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost of all four pizzas is the sum of the cost of the two pizzas we know about and the cost of the remaining two.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     30 + 2x = 64
     \]
   - Here, **30** represents the known cost of two pizzas, and **2x** represents the cost of the remaining two pizzas.

5. **Solving for x:**
   - Subtract **30** from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with **x**:
     \[
     2x = 64 - 30
     \]
     \[
     2x = 34
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by **2** to solve for **x**:
     \[
     x = \frac{34}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 17
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Each of the remaining two pizzas costs **\$17**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
