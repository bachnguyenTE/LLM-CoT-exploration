To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we'll break down her daily article counts and multiply by the time it takes to write each article.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote **5 articles**.
  
- **Tuesday:** She wrote **2/5 times more articles** than on Monday.
  
  \[
  \text{Tuesday's articles} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
  
- **Wednesday:** She wrote **twice the number of articles** she wrote on Tuesday.
  
  \[
  \text{Wednesday's articles} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles over the three days.**

\[
\text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent writing articles.**

Each article takes **4 hours** to write.

\[
\text{Total time} = 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 24 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{24}
\]
