**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of people in the elevator:**
   - Jack + 8 adults = 9 people.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the people:**
   - Each adult weighs 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults × 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

3. **Find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load:**
   - Maximum load = 700 kg.
   - Exceeded load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 22 kg.

**Answer:** \(\boxed{22 \text{ kg}}\)
