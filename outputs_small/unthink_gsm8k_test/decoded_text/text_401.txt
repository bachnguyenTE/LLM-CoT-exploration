**Solution:**

First, let's determine how many days the builder works in a year.

1. **Days per month:** 6 days  
2. **Number of months in a year:** 12 months  

Total days worked in a year = 6 days/month × 12 months = 72 days

Next, calculate the total earnings for the year.

2. **Total earnings:** 72 days × \$50/day = \$3,600

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$3,\!600}
