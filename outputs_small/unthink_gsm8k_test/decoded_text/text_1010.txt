Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.

1. **Bethany's Laps:**
   - Bethany can run **10 laps** in one hour.

2. **Trey's Laps:**
   - Trey can run **4 more laps** than Bethany.
   - **Trey's laps = Bethany's laps + 4**
   - **Trey's laps = 10 + 4 = 14 laps**

3. **Shaelyn's Laps:**
   - Shaelyn can run **half as many laps** as Trey.
   - **Shaelyn's laps = Trey's laps / 2**
   - **Shaelyn's laps = 14 / 2 = 7 laps**

4. **Quinn's Laps:**
   - Quinn can run **2 fewer laps** than Shaelyn.
   - **Quinn's laps = Shaelyn's laps - 2**
   - **Quinn's laps = 7 - 2 = 5 laps**

5. **Comparing Bethany and Quinn:**
   - **Difference in laps = Bethany's laps - Quinn's laps**
   - **Difference in laps = 10 - 5 = 5 laps**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{5}
