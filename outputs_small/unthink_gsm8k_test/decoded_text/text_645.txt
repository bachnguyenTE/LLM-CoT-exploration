**Solution:**

We are given that a **bag of flour** is divided into **8 portions**, each weighing **2 kilograms**. We need to find the total amount of flour in **3 bags** before they were divided into portions.

1. **Determine the amount of flour in one bag:**
   
   \[
   \text{Flour per bag} = 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total flour in 3 bags:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total flour} = 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{48\,\text{kilograms}}
\]
