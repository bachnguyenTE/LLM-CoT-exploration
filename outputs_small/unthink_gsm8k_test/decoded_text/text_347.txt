**Solution:**

Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall, each costing \$30. He received a 40% discount on the purchase. To find out how much he paid, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost without discount:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ shirts} \times \$30 \text{ per shirt} = \$60
   \]

2. **Determine the discount amount:**
   
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24
   \]

3. **Subtract the discount from the total cost:**
   
   \[
   \$60 - \$24 = \$36
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Davos paid \(\boxed{\$36}\) for the 2 shirts.
