**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of tapered candles Charlie can make from 1 pound of beeswax:**
   
   - Charlie can make **10 tapered candles** per pound of beeswax.

2. **Calculate the total number of candles Charlie makes:**
   
   - Charlie makes **20 candles**.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   
   - Each candle is sold for **\$2.00**.
   - Total revenue = Number of candles × Price per candle
   - Total revenue = 20 × \$2.00 = **\$42.00**

4. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   
   - 1 pound of beeswax and wicks cost **\$10.0**.
   - Total cost = **\$10.0**

5. **Calculate the net profit:**
   
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = \$42.00 - \$10.00 = **\$32.00**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{32.00}
