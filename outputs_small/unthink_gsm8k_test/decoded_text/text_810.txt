**Solution:**

We are given that the number of students on campus doubles every month. At the beginning of the year, there are **10 students**. We need to find the **additional students** who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Students:**
   - **Start of the Year:** 10 students.

2. **Monthly Doubling:**
   - **End of Month 1 (End of January):** 10 × 2 = 20 students.
   - **End of Month 2 (End of February):** 20 × 2 = 40 students.
   - **End of Month 3 (End of March):** 40 ×2 = 80 students.
   - **End of Month 4 (End of April):** 80 ×2 = 160 students.
   - **End of Month 5 (End of May):** 160 ×2 = 320 students.

3. **Additional Students Joined by the End of May:**
   - **Total Students by End of May:** 320 students.
   - **Initial Students:** 10 students.
   - **Additional Students Joined:** 320 - 10 = 310 students.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{310}
\]
