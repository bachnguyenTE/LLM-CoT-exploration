Let's determine Harry's weight step by step.

1. **Martin's Weight:**
   \[
   \text{Martin} = 55\ \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Carl's Weight:**
   \[
   \text{Carl} = \text{Martin} + 16\ \text{kg} = 55\ \text{kg} + 16\ \text{kg} = 71\ \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Christian's Weight:**
   \[
   \text{Christian} = \text{Carl} + 8\ \text{kg} = 71\ \text{kg} + 8\ \text{kg} = 79\ \text{kg}
   \]

4. **Harry's Weight:**
   \[
   \text{Harry} = \text{Christian} - 5\ \text{kg} = 79\ \text{kg} - 5\ \text{kg} = 74\ \text{kg}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{74\ \text{kg}}
\]
