**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the costs:**
   - **Salad:** \$6
   - **Yogurt:** Half the price of a carrot.

2. **Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \).**
   - Therefore, the cost of one yogurt is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for the items Ellen eats daily:**
   - **Carrots:** 2 carrots × \( x \) = \( 2x \)
   - **Salad:** \$6
   - **Yogurt:** \( \frac{x}{2} \)

4. **Set up the equation for the total cost:**
   \[
   2x + 6 + \frac{x}{2} = 11
   \]

5. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 6 = 11
   \]
   \[
   \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 6 = 11
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} + 6 = 11
   \]

6. **Subtract 6 from both sides:**
   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} = 5
   \]

7. **Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   5x = 10
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

**Answer:** Ellen pays \$2 for one carrot every day.
