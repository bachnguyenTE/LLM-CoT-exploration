Q: Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, how many times does Sandra have to babysit?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of eggs needed for one Spanish flan:**
   
   - Sandra needs **3 eggs** per flan.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 flans:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 3 \text{ eggs/flan} \times 15 \text{ flans} = 15 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect the required eggs:**
   
   - Sandra receives **9 eggs** per babysitting session.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of babysitting sessions} = \frac{15 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 1.\overline{6} \text{ sessions}
   \]

   Since Sandra can't babysit a fraction of a time, she needs to complete the second babysitting session to collect the remaining eggs.

4. **Final Answer:**
   
   Sandra needs to babysit **2 times** to gather all the required eggs for the flans.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
