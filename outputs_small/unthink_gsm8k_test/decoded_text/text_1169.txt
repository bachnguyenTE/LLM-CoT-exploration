Q: Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given thrice as much. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Ronnie was given \$5.
- Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa received \( 3 \times 5 = \$15 \).

**After Giving Money to Their Little Sister:**
- Both Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount to their little sister.
- Let the amount each gave be \( x \).

**Remaining Money:**
- **Rissa's Remaining Money:**
  - She started with \$15 and gave away \$x.
  - So, her remaining money is \( 15 - x \).
  - It's given that Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money.
  - Therefore, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).
  - Simplifying: \( 15 - x = 4 \).
  - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 15 - 4 = 11 \).

**Amount Given to the Little Sister:**
- Both gave \$11 to their little sister.

**Remaining Money for Ronnie:**
- Ronnie started with \$5 and gave away \$11.
- So, her remaining money is \( 5 - 11 = -6 \).

Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have negative money. Let's check our calculations.

**Re-examining the Problem:**
- **Rissa's Remaining Money:**
  - She started with \$15 and gave away \$x.
  - Her remaining money is \( 15 - x \).
  - It's given that \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).
  - \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 4 \).
  - So, \( 15 - x = 4 \) ⇒ \( x = 11 \).

**Problem with the Calculation:**
- If both gave \$11, Ronnie's remaining money would be \( 5 - 1 = 4 \).
- But according to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, which is \$4.
- However, the question asks how much **left** in Ronnie's money, which would be \$4.

But wait, let's verify the calculations again.

**Alternative Approach:**
Let’s denote the amount each gave as \( x \).

- **Rissa's Remaining Money:**
  - She had \$15 initially.
  - After giving away \( x \), she has \( 15 - x \).
  - According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).
  - \( \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \).
  - So, \( 15 - x = 12 \) ⇒ \( x = 3 \).

**Amount Given to the Little Sister:**
- Both gave \$3 to their little sister.

**Remaining Money for Ronnie:**
- Ronnie had \$5 initially.
- After giving away \$3, she has \( 5 - 3 = 2 \).

**Final Answer:**
- Ronnie is left with \$2.

\boxed{2}
