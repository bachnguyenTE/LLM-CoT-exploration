**Solution:**

To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal of raising **\$200**, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount earned so far:**
   \[
   \$83 \text{ (Keegan)} + \$91 \text{ (Tasha)} = \$174
   \]

2. **Subtract the total earned from the goal to find the remaining amount needed:**
   \[
   \$200 \text{ (goal)} - \$174 \text{ (earned)} = \$26 \text{ (needed)}
   \]

**Answer:** They need to earn **\$26** more to reach their goal.
