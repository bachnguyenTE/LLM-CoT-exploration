**Solution:**

1. **Determine the loan amount:**
   - **House worth:** \$250,000
   - **Loan amount:** 40% of \$250,0000
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     0.40 \times 250,0000 = 102,0000
     \]
   - **Loan amount:** \$102,000

2. **Determine the amount used to pay off debts:**
   - **60% of the loan amount:**
     \[
     0.60 \times 102,0000 = 61,2000
     \]
   - **Amount used to pay off debts:** \$61,2000

3. **Calculate the leftover money after paying debts:**
   - **Total loan amount:** \$102,000
   - **Amount used to pay off debts:** \$61,200
   - **Leftover money:**
     \[
     102,0000 - 61,2000 = 40,8000
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40,\!800}
\]
