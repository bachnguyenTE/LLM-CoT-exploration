Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard.

1. **Total Eggs Collected by Cole:**
   - Cole hid **3 dozen eggs**.
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - So, 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = **36 eggs**.

2. **Eggs Found by Lamar:**
   - Lamar found **5 eggs**.

3. **Eggs Found by Stacy:**
   - Stacy found **twice as many as Lamar**.
   - Lamar found 5 eggs, so Stacy found 2 × 5 = **10 eggs**.

4. **Eggs Found by Charlie:**
   - Charlie found **2 less than Stacy**.
   - Stacy found 10 eggs, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = **8 eggs**.

5. **Eggs Found by Mei:**
   - Mei found **half as many as Charlie**.
   - Charlie found 8 eggs, so Mei found 8 ÷ 2 = **4 eggs**.

6. **Total Eggs Found:**
   - Cole: 36 eggs
   - Lamar: 5 eggs
   - Stacy: 10 eggs
   - Charlie: 8 eggs
   - Mei: 4 eggs
   - **Total = 36 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 63 eggs**

7. **Eggs Still Hidden:**
   - Total eggs found: 63 eggs
   - Total eggs hidden initially: 3 dozen = 36 eggs
   - **Eggs still hidden = 36 - 63 = 3 eggs**
