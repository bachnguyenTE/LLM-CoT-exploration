**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Reward Calculation:**
   - The customer earned rewards based on their spending.
   - **Total spent last time:** \$80
   - **Rewards per \$20:** 1 reward of \$1 off
   - **Rewards earned:** 
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} \times 1 = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]
   - **Total value of rewards:** \$4

2. **This Shopping Trip Details:**
   - **Spent:** \$43
   - **Used Rewards:** \$4 off
   - **Applied Coupon:** The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price.
     \[
     2 \times 4 = \$8
     \]
   - **Total discount from coupon:** \$8

3. **Total Payment:**
   - **Total spent:** \$43
   - **Subtract discounts:**
     \[
     43 - 4 - 8 = \$31
     \]

**Final Answer:**
