To determine the total number of posts that the Reddit group will have in March, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of members and their average posts per day:**
   - **Number of members:** 1,000
   - **Average posts per day per member:** 3

2. **Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group:**
   \[
   \text{Total posts per day} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Average posts per day per member} = 1,000 \times 3 = 3,000
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days in March:**
   - **Number of days in March:** 31

4. **Calculate the total number of posts for the entire month:**
   \[
   \text{Total posts in March} = \text{Total posts per day} \times \text{Number of days in March} = 3,000 \times 31 = 93,300
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{93,\!300}
\]
