Q: Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Watson's hourly earnings for the week:**
   
   Watson works **10 hours/day** for **5 days/week**.
   
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   
   He earns **\$10/hour**.
   
   \[
   55 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$550/\text{week}
   \]

2. **Add the weekly bonus for the month:**
   
   The company gives a **\$300 bonus** each week if the company performs well.
   
   \[
   \$550 \text{ (earnings)} + \$300 \text{ (bonus)} = \$855 \text{ total for April}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$855}
\]
