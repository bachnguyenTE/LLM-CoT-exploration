Q: The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope in centimeters?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
3. The combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( R \) = length of the red rope (in centimeters)
- Let \( B \) = length of the blue rope (in centimeters)
- Let \( Y \) = length of the yellow rope (in centimeters)

**From the first statement:**
\[ R = 4B \]

**From the second statement:**
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ \Rightarrow Y = B + 7 \]

**From the third statement:**
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

**Substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \):**
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

**Combine like terms:**
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

**Solve for \( B \):**
\[ 6B = 37 - 7 \]
\[ 6B = 30 \]
\[ B = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

**Now, find \( R \):**
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ centimeters} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
