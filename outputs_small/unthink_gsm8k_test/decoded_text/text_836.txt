Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Kora made 20 clay dishes.
- Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora.
- Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory.

**Step 1: Determine the number of dishes Rory made.**

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora.

\[
\text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of dishes Jada made.**

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory.

\[
\text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three.**

\[
\text{Total dishes} = \text{Jada's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Kora's dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 148
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{148}
\]
