**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of elves hired initially:**  
   Nissa hires **60** seasonal workers to play elves.

2. **First quit:**  
   A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them.  
   - **Number of elves who quit:**  
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
     \]
   - **Number of elves remaining after the first quit:**  
     \[
     60 - 20 = 44
     \]

3. **Second quit:**  
   Then, **10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.**  
   - **Number of elves who quit:**  
     \[
     10
     \]
   - **Number of elves remaining after the second quit:**  
     \[
     44 - 10 = 33
     \]

4. **Final number of elves left:**  
   After both quits, **33** elves remain.

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
