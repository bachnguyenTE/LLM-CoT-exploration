Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Seattle has 20 sheep.
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

**Step 1: Determine the number of sheep in Charleston.**

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle:
\[
\text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse.**

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston:
\[
\text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.**

\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 268
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{268}
\]
