**Solution:**

We need to determine how much more it costs to buy a mixture of almonds and walnuts compared to another mixture. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Cost of 1 pound almonds = \$10
   - Cost of 1 pound walnuts = \$15

2. **First Mixture:**
   - **Almonds:** 1/2 pound
   - **Walnuts:** 1/3 pound

   **Cost Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$10 = \$5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \frac{5}{3} \approx \$1.67
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$5 + \$1.67 = \$6.67
   \]

3. **Second Mixture:**
   - **Almonds:** 1/5 pound
   - **Walnuts:** 1/3 pound

   **Cost Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \times \$10 = \$2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \$5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$2 + \$5 = \$7
   \]

4. **Difference in Cost:**
   \[
   \$7 - \$6.67 = \$0.33
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$0.33}
\]
