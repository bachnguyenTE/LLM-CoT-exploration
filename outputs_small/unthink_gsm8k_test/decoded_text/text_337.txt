Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Luke's Hot Dogs:**
   - Luke ate **2 hot dogs**.

2. **Thomas's Hot Dogs:**
   - Thomas ate **three times more** hot dogs than Luke.
   - **Three times** Luke's amount = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hot dogs.
   - **Plus the original amount** (Luke's 2 hot dogs) = \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) hot dogs.
   - **Total for Thomas:** **8 hot dogs**.

3. **John's Hot Dogs:**
   - John ate **half the amount** Thomas ate.
   - **Half of 8** = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hot dogs.
   - **Total for John:** **4 hot dogs**.

4. **Difference Between John and Luke:**
   - **John ate 4 hot dogs**.
   - **Luke ate 2 hot dogs**.
   - **Difference:** \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) hot dogs.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{2}
