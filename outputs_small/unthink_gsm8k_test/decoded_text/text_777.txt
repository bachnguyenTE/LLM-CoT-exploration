Q: Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?

To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Movies:**
   \[
   600 \text{ movies}
   \]

2. **Movies in Various Series:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   - **Cost for Series Movies:**
     \[
     200 \text{ movies} \times \$6 = \$1200
     \]
     (Note: This cost is based on the series price, which is a third of the normal price.)

3. **Remaining Movies After Series:**
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older Movies (40% of Remaining):**
   \[
   0.40 \times 440 = 176.8 \text{ movies}
   \]
   - **Cost for Older Movies:**
     \[
     176.8 \text{ movies} \times \$5 = \$884
     \]

5. **Older Movies Remaining:**
   \[
   440 - 176.8 = 263.2 \text{ movies}
   \]
   - **Cost for Older Movies (Normal Price):**
     \[
     263.2 \text{ movies} \times \$10 = \$2,892
     \]

6. **Total Cost for Digital Movies:**
   \[
   \$1,220 + \$884 + \$2,892 = \$4,986
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$4,986}
\]
