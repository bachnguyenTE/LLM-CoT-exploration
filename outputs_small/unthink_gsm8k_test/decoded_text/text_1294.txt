To determine the total amount Jake spends at the store, let's break down each item he purchases and apply the discounts accordingly.

1. **T-shirts:**
   - **Original Price per T-shirt:** \$8
   - **Number of T-shirts Purchased:** 2
   - **Discount Offer:** Buy one, get one 50% off
   - **Calculation:**
     - First T-shirt: Full price = \$8
     - Second T-shirt: 50% off = 8 - (8 × 00%) = 8 - 0.40 = \$7.56
     - **Total for T-shirts:** \$8 + \$7.56 = \$15.56

2. **Shoes:**
   - **Original Price:** \$40
   - **Discount Offer:** 40% off
   - **Calculation:**
     - Discount Amount = 40% of \$40 = 0.40 × 40 = \$16.40
     - **Final Price for Shoes:** \$40 - \$16.40 = \$33.60

3. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - **T-shirts:** \$15.56
   - **Shoes:** \$33.60
   - **Total:** \$15.56 + \$33.60 = **\$49.16**

\boxed{49.16}
