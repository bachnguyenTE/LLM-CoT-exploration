Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Ben** has:
  - 4 tubes of **blue paint**
  - 3 tubes of **yellow paint**
- **Jasper** has:
  - Half as many **blue paint** as Ben
  - Three times as many **yellow paint** as Ben

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blue paint tubes Jasper has.**

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Jasper has half as many.

\[
\text{Blue paint (Jasper)} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ tubes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has.**

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many.

\[
\text{Yellow paint (Jasper)} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of paint tubes Jasper has.**

\[
\text{Total paint (Jasper)} = \text{Blue paint} + \text{Yellow paint} = 2 + 9 = 11 \text{ tubes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
