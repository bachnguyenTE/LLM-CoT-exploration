**Solution:**

To determine how much money John spent at the market, we'll calculate the total cost of the goats and cows separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   - Number of goats: 3
   - Cost per goat: \$500
   - Total cost for goats: \( 3 \times 500 = 1500 \) dollars

2. **Cost of cows:**
   - Number of cows: 2
   - Cost per cow: \$1500
   - Total cost for cows: \( 2 \times1500 = 3000 \) dollars

3. **Total money spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
   - Total cost = \( 1500 + 3000 = 4550 \) dollars

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4550}
\]
