**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of pineapples per hectare:**
   
   \[
   100 \text{ pineapples/ha}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pineapples in 10 hectares:**
   
   \[
   10 \text{ ha} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/ha} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

3. **Determine how many harvest cycles there are in a year:**
   
   - **Harvest every 3 months:** There are 4 quarters (3 months) in a year.
   
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ year}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \text{ harvest cycles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   
   \[
   1000 \text{ pineapples/ha} \times 10 \text{ ha} \times 4 \text{ harvest cycles} = 4000 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{4000}
\]
