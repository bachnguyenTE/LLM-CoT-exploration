**Solution:**

To find John's average score across the 4 tests, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:**
   
   \[
   100 \text{ (first test)} + 100 \text{ (second test)} + 100 \text{ (third test)} = 300
   \]

2. **Add the score of the 4th test:**
   
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. **Divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:**
   
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{95}
\]
