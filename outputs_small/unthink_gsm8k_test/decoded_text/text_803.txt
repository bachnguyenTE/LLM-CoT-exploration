**Solution:**

Kris aims to play a total of **30 hours** to earn the video game achievement.

1. **First Scenario:**
   - **Daily Play Time:** 30 hours per week
   - **Number of Weeks:** 2 weeks
   - **Total Play Time:** \( 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 60 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - **First Period:** 15 hours per day for 2 weeks
     - **Total Play Time:** \( 15 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ hours} \)
   - **Second Period:** 2 hours per day for 1 week
     - **Total Play Time:** \( 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \)
   - **Combined Play Time:** \( 210 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 228 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Total Play Time:** \( 228 \text{ hours} \)

4. **Remaining Play Time Needed:**
   - **Total Required:** 30 hours
   - **Already Played:** 228 hours
   - **Remaining:** \( 30 \text{ hours} - 228 \text{ hours} = -20 \text{ hours} \)

   **Conclusion:** Kris has already played **228 hours**, which exceeds the required **30 hours** by **20 hours**.

**Final Answer:** Kris has already earned the video game achievement by playing **228 hours**.
