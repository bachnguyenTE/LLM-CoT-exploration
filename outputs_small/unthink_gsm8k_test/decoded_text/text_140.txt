To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total 20 available cars, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of semi-automatic cars:**
   - Total cars = 20
   - Automatic cars = 12
   - Manual cars = 4
   - Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
   - Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4 = 6

2. **Calculate the percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{20} \right) \times 100 = 30\%
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{33\%}\)
