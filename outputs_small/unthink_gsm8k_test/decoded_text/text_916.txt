Q: Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them.

1. **Total Allowance Together:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total allowance each girl received.
   - Combined allowance: \( 2x \)

2. **Cost of the Cake:**
   - The cake costs \$11.

3. **Cost of Balloons:**
   - 1 dozen balloons = 12 balloons.
   - Sold for \$0.5 for 2 balloons.
   - Cost per 2 balloons: \$0.5
   - Number of sets of 2 balloons: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Total cost for balloons: \( 6 \times \$0.5 = \$3 \)

4. **Remaining Money for Ice Cream:**
   - Total money spent on cake and balloons: \( \$11 + \$3 = \$14 \)
   - Remaining money: \( 2x - \$14 \)
   - This amount was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream at \$7 each.
   - Total cost for ice cream: \( 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \)

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - \$14 = \$14
   \]
   
6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x = \$14 + \$14 = \$28 \\
   x = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
