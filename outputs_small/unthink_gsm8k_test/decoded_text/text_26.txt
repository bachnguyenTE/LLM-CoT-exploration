To determine how many dollars Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we'll calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum them up.

1. **Total Cost for Shorts:**
   - Mishka bought **3 pairs** of shorts.
   - Each pair costs **\$16.50**.
   - **Total cost for shorts:** \( 3 \times \$16.50 = \$49.50 \)

2. **Total Cost for Pants:**
   - Mishka bought **3 pairs** of pants.
   - Each pair costs **\$22.50**.
   - **Total cost for pants:** \( 3 \times \$22.50 = \$67.50 \)

3. **Total Cost for Shoes:**
   - Mishka bought **3 pairs** of shoes.
   - Each pair costs **\$42.00**.
   - **Total cost for shoes:** \( 3 \times \$42.00 = \$126.0 \)

4. **Total Cost for All Clothing Items:**
   - **Total cost:** \( \$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126.00 = \$243.00 \)

**Final Answer:**
