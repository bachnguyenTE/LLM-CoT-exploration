**Solution:**

1. **Determine the daily eating rate of each person:**
   
   - **Abby's rate:** She eats 2 slices per day.
   - **Josh's rate:** He eats twice as much as Abby, so:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/day} \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption of the bread:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ slices/day (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices/day (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the bread will last:**
   
   The loaf has 24 slices. Dividing the total number of slices by the daily consumption:
   
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
