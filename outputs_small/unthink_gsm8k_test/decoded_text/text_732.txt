Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Dora's age = 15 years
- Dora's father's age = 8 more than twice Dora's age
- Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4 years

**Step 1: Calculate Dora's Father's Age**

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18 \text{ years}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Dora's Mother's Age**

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \text{ years}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Combined Age**

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 18 + 14 = 47 \text{ years}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{47}
\]
