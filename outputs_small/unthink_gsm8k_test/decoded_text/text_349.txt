To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, let's break down the costs month by month and then scale them up to a year.

**Monthly Costs:**
- **Food:** \$25 per week
- **Treats:** \$20 per month
- **Medicine:** \$100 per month

**Calculations:**
1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   \[
   25 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 100 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]
   
2. **Treats Cost per Month:** Given as \$20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:** Given as \$100.

**Total Monthly Cost:**
\[
100 \text{ (Food)} + 20 \text{ (Treats)} + 100 \text{ (Medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars/month}
\]

**Annual Cost:**
\[
220 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 2640 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2640}
\]
