**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - Tom bought a CD for \$4.
   - He also bought a headphone set.
   - In total, he paid \$48.

2. **Defining Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of one CD.
   - Let \( H \) be the cost of one headphone set.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total amount Tom paid is the sum of the cost of one CD and one headphone set.
   \[
   C + H = 48
   \]
   - We know that the cost of one CD is \$4.
   \[
   C = 4
   \]

4. **Substituting the Value of \( C \) into the Equation:**
   \[
   4 + H = 48
   \]
   - Solving for \( H \):
   \[
   H = 48 - 4 = 44
   \]
   - So, the cost of one headphone set is \$44.

5. **Determining How Many More CDs Tom Could Buy Without the Headphone Set:**
   - If Tom decides not to buy the headphone set, he will only spend the amount he spent on the CD.
   - Total amount he would have spent on CDs: \$48.
   - Number of CDs he can buy with \$48:
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{C} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom could buy 12 CDs.
   - Therefore, he would have been able to buy **12 more CDs**.

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
