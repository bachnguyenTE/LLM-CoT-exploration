Q: Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When he turns 24, his age will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.

**Let’s define the variables:**
- Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad.
- Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

**Current Ages:**
- Emil is 19.
- His dad's age is \( D \).
- His brother's age is \( B \).

**When Emil turns 24:**
- **Emil's Age:** \( 24 \) years from now.
- **Dad's Age:** \( D + 24 \).
- **Brother's Age:** \( B + 24 \).

**According to the problem:**
- At that time, Emil's age will be half of his dad's age:
  \[
  24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 24)
  \]
- Also, Emil's age will be twice his brother's age:
  \[
  24 = 2(B + 24)
  \]

**Solving for \( D \) and \( B \):**

1. **From the first equation:**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 24)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   48 = D + 24
   \]
   Subtract 24 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 24
   \]
   So, the dad is currently 24 years old.

2. **From the second equation:**
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 24)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 24
   \]
   Subtract 24 from both sides:
   \[
   B = -12
   \]
   Wait, this doesn't make sense because a negative age doesn't exist. Let's check our equations again.

**Re-examining the Equations:**

Upon reviewing, it seems there might be a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let's correct the approach.

**Correct Interpretation:**
- When Emil turns 24, his age will be half of his dad's age and twice his brother's age.

So, the correct equations should be:

1. **Emil's Age = Half of Dad's Age:**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 24)
   \]
   Solving:
   \[
   48 = D + 24 \implies D = 24
   \]

2. **Emil's Age = Twice Brother's Age:**
   \[
   24 = 2(B +24)
   \]
   Solving:
   \[
   12 = B +24 \implies B = -12
   \]
   Again, a negative age doesn't make sense. This suggests an error in the problem setup or interpretation.

**Alternative Approach:**
Let's consider the time difference. The current age difference between Emil and his dad is \( D - 19 \). When Emil turns 24, the dad will be \( D + (24 -19) = D +5 \) years old.

Given that at that time, Emil's age is half of his dad's age:
\[
24 = \frac{1}{2}(D +5)
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
48 = D +5 \implies D = 43
\]

Now, check the brother's age:
- When Emil is 24, the brother's age will be \( B +5 \).
- At that time, Emil's age is twice his brother's age:
  \[
  24 = 2(B +5)
  \]
  Solving:
  \[
  12 = B +5 \implies B = 7
  \]

**Final Answer:**
- Current age of Emil's dad: \( 43 \) years.
- Current age of Emil's brother: \( 7 \) years.

**Sum of the Ages:**
\[
43 + 7 = 50
\]

\(\boxed{50}\)
