Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Jen got 3 fish. They each need \$1 worth of food a day. How much does she spend on food in the month of May?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of people:**
   - Jen has 3 fish.
   - Each fish needs \$1 worth of food per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of people (including Jen) is **3**.

2. **Calculate daily food cost:**
   - Each person needs \$1 per day.
   - Total daily food cost = Number of people × Cost per person
   - Total daily food cost = 3 × \$1 = **\$3**

3. **Determine the number of days in May:**
   - May has **31 days**.

4. **Calculate monthly food cost:**
   - Total monthly food cost = Total daily food cost × Number of days
   - Total monthly food cost = \$3 × 31 = **\$93**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$93}
