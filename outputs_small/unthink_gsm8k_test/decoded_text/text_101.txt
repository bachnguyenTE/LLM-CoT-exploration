**Solution:**

To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average each day, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:**
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 4 \ (\text{Science}) + 20 \ (\text{Social Studies}) + 7 \ (\text{History}) + 8 \ (\text{Geography}) = 42 \ \text{pages}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pages already read:**
   \[
   \text{Pages read on Monday} = 15 \ \text{pages}
   \]

3. **Find out how many pages are left to read:**
   \[
   \text{Pages remaining} = 42 \ (\text{total}) - 15 \ (\text{read}) = 27 \ \text{pages}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of pages to read per day for the remaining 4 days:**
   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{27 \ \text{pages}}{4 \ \text{days}} = 6.75 \ \text{pages/day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6.75}
\]
