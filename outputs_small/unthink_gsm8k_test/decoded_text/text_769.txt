**Solution:**

To determine how much Tanya earned over the two days, we'll break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - **Classes:** 4 classes
   - **Hours:** 5 hours
   - **Earnings per hour:** \$15
   - **Additional earnings per day:** \$5 per class
   - **Total earnings for Monday:**
     \[
     (4 \text{ classes} \times \$5/\text{class}) + (5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour}) = \$20 + \$75 = \$95
     \]

2. **Wednesday:**
   - **Classes:** 2 classes
   - **Hours:** 2 hours
   - **Earnings per hour:** \$15
   - **Additional earnings per day:** \$5 per class
   - **Total earnings for Wednesday:**
     \[
     (2 \text{ classes} \times \$5/\text{class}) + (2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour}) = \$10 + \$30 = \$40
     \]

3. **Total Earnings for Both Days:**
   \[
   \$95 \text{ (Monday)} + \$44 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$139
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{139}
\]
