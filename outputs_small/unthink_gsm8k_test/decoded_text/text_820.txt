**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - **Total Time Walked:** 8 hours
   - **Second Day:**
     - **Time Walked:** Half as many hours as the first day.
     - **Calculation:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \) hours = 4 hours

2. **Total Time Walked Over Two Days:**
   - **First Day:** 8 hours
   - **Second Day:** 4 hours
   - **Total:** \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours

3. **Convert Hours to Minutes:**
   - **1 hour = 60 minutes**
   - **Total Minutes:** \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{720}
