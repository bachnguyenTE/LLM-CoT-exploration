**Solution:**

To determine how much fabric Luke needs to buy, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the width of one window:**
   \[
   \text{Width of one window} = 35 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total width of all five windows:**
   \[
   \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} = 175 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Find the amount of fabric needed, which is twice the total width of the windows:**
   \[
   \text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 \text{ inches} = 350 \text{ inches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{350 \text{ inches}}
\]
