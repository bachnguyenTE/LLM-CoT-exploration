**Solution:**

To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Total Graduation Capacity:**
   \[
   6000 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Seats for Graduates:**
   \[
   950 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. **Seats for Faculty:**
   \[
   300 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. **Total Seats Allocated:**
   \[
   950 + 300 = 1255 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. **Remaining Seats for Graduates' Friends and Family:**
   \[
   6000 - 1255 = 4745 \text{ seats}
   \]

6. **Number of Graduates:**
   \[
   950 \text{ graduates}
   \]

7. **Tickets per Graduate:**
   \[
   \frac{4745}{955} \approx 4.99 \text{ tickets per graduate}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
