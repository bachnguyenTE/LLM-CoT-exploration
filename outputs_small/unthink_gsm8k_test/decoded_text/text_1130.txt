Q: Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Nik has 2000 crayons.
   - Each box can hold 8 crayons.
   - Number of boxes = Total crayons ÷ Crayons per box
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes × Weight per box
     \[
     \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Total weight of crayons = Total number of crayons × Weight per crayon
     \[
     \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Find the combined total weight:**
   - Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Convert ounces to pounds:**
   - 1 pound = 16 ounces
   - Total weight in pounds = Total weight in ounces ÷ 16
     \[
     \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} \approx 66.6667 \text{ pounds}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{66.\overline{6} \text{ pounds}}
\]
