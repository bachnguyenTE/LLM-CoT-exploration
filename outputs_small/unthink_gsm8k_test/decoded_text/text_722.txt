Q: Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?

To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the cost of fixing the pothole with the cost of buying the asphalt.

1. **Cost of Fixing the Pothole:**
   - The pothole causes damage worth \$450.
   - Therefore, Ron has to pay \$450 to fix it.

2. **Cost of Buying Asphalthene:**
   - Each bucket costs \$25.
   - Ron needs 3 buckets.
   - Total cost = 3 × \$25 = \$75.

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of Fixing the Pothole - Cost of Asphalthene
   - Savings = \$450 - \$75 = \$375.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{375}
