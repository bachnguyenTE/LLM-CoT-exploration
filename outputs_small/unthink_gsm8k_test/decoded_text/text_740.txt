**Solution:**

We are given a class of **50 students** with various hobbies. The breakdown is as follows:

- **10 students** like to **bake**.
- **5 students** like to **play basketball**.
- The **remaining students** like to either **play video games** or **play music**.

We are also told that:
- The number of students who like **music** is **twice** the number of students who prefer **playing basketball**.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:** 50

2. **Number of students who like to bake:** 10

3. **Number of students who like to play basketball:** 5

4. **Number of students who like to play music:** Let's denote this as \( M \).

   - Given that \( M = 2 \times \) (number of students who play basketball)
   - So, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \)

5. **Number of students who like to play video games:** Let's denote this as \( V \).

   - The remaining students like either video games or music.
   - So, \( V + M = \) total students - those who like to bake - those who like to play basketball

6. **Calculating the number of students who like video games:**

   \[
   V = \text{Total students} - \text{Students who bake} - \text{Students who play basketball} - \text{Students who play music}
   \]
   
   \[
   V = 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
