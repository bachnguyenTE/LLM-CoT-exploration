Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Frances has left.

1. **Calculate the total money from selling cupcakes:**
   - Frances sells 20 cupcakes.
   - Each cupcake is sold for \$2.
   - **Total money from cupcakes:** \( 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \)

2. **Calculate the total money from selling cookies:**
   - Frances sells 40 cookies.
   - Each cookie is sold for \$1.
   - **Total money from cookies:** \( 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \)

3. **Calculate the total money from both cupcakes and cookies:**
   - **Total money:** \( \$40 \text{ (cupcakes)} + \$40 \text{ (cookies)} = \$80 \)

4. **Calculate the total cost of buying the trays:**
   - Frances buys 5 trays.
   - Each tray costs \$4.
   - **Total cost for trays:** \( 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \)

5. **Calculate the money left after purchases:**
   - **Money left:** \( \$80 \text{ (total)} - \$20 \text{ (trays)} = \$60 \)

**Final Answer:** Frances has \$60 left.
