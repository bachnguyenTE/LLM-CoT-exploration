To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we'll calculate the production rates for each flavor and then multiply by the total time.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - **Production:** 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - **Rate:** \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
   - **Total in 48 hours:** \( 55 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2640 \text{ quarts} \).

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - **Production:** 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - **Rate:** \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 13.75 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
   - **Total in 48 hours:** \( 13.75 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 654 \text{ quarts} \).

3. **Total Ice Cream:**
   - **Chocolate + Vanilla:** \( 2640 \text{ quarts} + 654 \text{ quarts} = 3294 \text{ quarts} \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{3294}\)
