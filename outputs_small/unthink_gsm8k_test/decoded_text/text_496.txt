Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Brett is currently 14 years old.
- In four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( A \) be Angela's current age.

**Step 1: Express Angela's age in four years.**
- In four years, Angela will be \( A + 4 \) years old.

**Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information.**
- In four years, Angela's age will be three times Brett's current age.
- Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \( 3 \times 14 = 12 \).
- Therefore, the equation is:
  \[
  A + 4 = 12
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( A \).**
\[
A + 4 = 12 \\
A = 12 - 4 \\
A = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**
Angela is currently \(\boxed{8}\) years old.
