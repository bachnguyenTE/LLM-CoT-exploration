To determine how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we can use the following steps:

1. **Total Cookies Made:**  
   The Adams family has made a total of **7,995** cookies.

2. **Rainbow Cookies:**  
   They have made **2,595** rainbow cookies.

3. **Oatmeal Cookies:**  
   They have made **3,075** oatmeal cookies.

4. **Calculate Chocolate Chip Cookies:**  
   To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total cookies made.

   \[
   \text{Chocolate Chip Cookies} = \text{Total Cookies} - \text{Rainbow Cookies} - \text{Oatmeal Cookies}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[
   \text{Chocolate Chip Cookies} = 7,995 - 2,595 - 3,075
   \]

5. **Perform the Subtraction:**  
   \[
   7,995 - 2,595 = 5,400
   \]
   \[
   5,400 - 3,075 = 2,325
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**  
   The Adams family has made **2,325** chocolate chip cookies.

\[
\boxed{2325}
\]
