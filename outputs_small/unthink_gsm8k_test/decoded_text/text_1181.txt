Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( C \) = Colin's current age
- \( W \) = Wendy's current age

**Given:**
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5 \times (C + 7)
   \]
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5 \times (C + 7))
\]

**Step 2:** Simplify the equation.

\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

**Step 3:** Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction.

\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

**Step 4:** Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \).

\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]

\[
40 = 2C
\]

\[
C = 20
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
