Q: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final value of the number train.

**Given:**
- **Starting value (S):** 20
- **Operations:**
  1. Add half of the starting value to the starting value.
  2. Divide the result by 5.
  3. Multiply the result by (starting value minus 12).

**Step 1: Calculate Half of the Starting Value**
\[
\text{Half of } S = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

**Step 2: Add Half of the Starting Value to the Starting Value**
\[
S + \text{Half of } S = 20 + 10 = 32
\]

**Step 3: Divide the Result by 5**
\[
\frac{32}{5} = 6.4
\]

**Step 4: Subtract 12 from the Starting Value**
\[
S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

**Step 5: Multiply the Result by the Value from Step 4**
\[
6.4 \times 8 = 51.2
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{51.2}
\]
