Q: Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially.**

2. **She sold a third at the green house:**
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after green house} = x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

3. **She sold 2 more to the red house:**
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold to red house} = 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after red house} = \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

4. **She sold half of what was left at the orange house:**
   \[
   \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at orange house} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after orange house} = \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]

5. **According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left:**
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   
6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 5 + 1 = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

**Final Answer:** Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners.
