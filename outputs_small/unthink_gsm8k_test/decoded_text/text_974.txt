Q: Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. If Tyler earns $5 per hour, how many hours does he have to work to afford his books?

**Solution:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of Tyler's books:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$18 (\text{dictionary}) + \$13 (\text{dinosaur book}) + \$8 (\text{children's cookbook}) = \$39
\]

Tyler has already saved \$14. To find out how much more he needs to save:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = \$39 - \$14 = \$25
\]

Tyler earns \$5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to save the remaining \$25:

\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Answer:** Tyler needs to work for \(\boxed{5}\) hours.
