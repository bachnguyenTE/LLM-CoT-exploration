Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Tuesday:** Bruce works for 5 hours.
- **Wednesday:** He works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
- **Thursday:** He works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.

**Step 1: Calculate the hours worked on Wednesday.**

\[
\text{Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 5\ \text{hours} = 10\ \text{hours}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the hours worked on Thursday.**

\[
\text{Thursday} = \text{Wednesday} - 2\ \text{hours} = 10\ \text{hours} - 2\ \text{hours} = 8\ \text{hours}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours worked over the three days.**

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} = 5\ \text{hours} + 10\ \text{hours} + 8\ \text{hours} = 23\ \text{hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{23}
\]
