To determine how much Tyson would spend on make muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed:**
   - **Total people watching the game:** 20
   - **Each sandwich serves 4 people**
   - **Total sandwiches needed:** \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed per sandwich:**
   - **Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese**
   - **Total meat needed:** \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds
   - **Total cheese needed:** \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds

3. **Calculate the cost of meat and cheese:**
   - **Meat cost:** \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \)
   - **Cheese cost:** \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \)

4. **Add the costs together to find the total expenditure:**
   - **Total cost:** \( \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.0 \)

**Final Answer:** Tyson would spend **\$50.00** on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches for 20 people.
