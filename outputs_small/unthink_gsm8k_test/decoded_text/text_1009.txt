To determine the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Students:**
   - Total students = 3000

2. **Students Over 16 Years Old:**
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Number of students over 16 = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

3. **Male Students Over 16 Years Old:**
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - Number of male students over 16 = \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)

4. **Female Students Over 16 Years Old:**
   - The remaining half of the students over 16 are female.
   - Number of female students over 16 = \( 1550 - 375 = 1175 \)

5. **Students Under 16 Years Old:**
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Number of students under 16 = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

6. **Male Students Under 16 Years Old:**
   - One-half of the students under 16 are male.
   - Number of male students under 16 = \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)

7. **Female Students Under 16 Years Old:**
   - The remaining half of the students under 16 are female.
   - Number of female students under 16 = \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

8. **Total Female Students:**
   - Total female students = Female students over 16 + Female students under 16
   - Total female students = \( 1175 + 750 = 1925 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1925}
\]
