**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Price of the Watch:**
   - Let the original price of the watch be \( P \).

2. **Price Mr. Rogers Paid:**
   - Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   - So, the price he paid is \( 75\% \times P = 0.75P \).

3. **Price Mr. Rogers Sold to His Friend:**
   - He sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it.
   - The price he sold it for is \( 120\% \times 0.75P = 1.2 \times 0.75P = 0.9P \).

4. **Percentage Discount from the Original Price:**
   - The final price Mr. Rogers received is \( 0.9P \).
   - The discount from the original price is \( P - 0.9P = 0.1P \).
   - To find the percentage discount: \( \frac{0.1P}{P} \times 100 = 10\% \).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{10\%}\)
