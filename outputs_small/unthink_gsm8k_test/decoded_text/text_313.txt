Q: Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cera's Current Age:** 46 years
- **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:** 3000 times Noah's Current Age

**Let’s define:**
- **N** = Noah's Current Age
- **P** = Current Population of Chile

**Step 1: Determine Noah's Age Six Years Ago**
- **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:** \( N - 6 \)

**Step 2: Relate Population of Chile Six Years Ago to Current Population**
- **Population Six Years Ago:** \( P - 6 \) (since population decreases by 1 each year)
- **Given:** \( P - 6 = 3000 \times N \)

**Step 3: Relate Noah's Age Six Years Ago to Cera's Age**
- **Cera's Age Six Years Ago:** \( 46 -6 = 40 \) years
- **Given:** \( N = 2 \times 40 = 80 \) years

**Step 4: Substitute Noah's Age into the Population Equation**
- \( P - 6 = 3300 \times 80 \)
- \( P -6 = 264,000 \)
- \( P = 264,006 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{264006}
\]
