**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.
   - The problem states: "Twenty dozen cups cost \$1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at \$6000 each."

2. **Defining Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of one cup.
   - Let \( P \) be the cost of one plate.

3. **Calculating the Total Cost of Plates:**
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Cost per plate = \$6000.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = \( 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculating the Total Cost of Cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups = 240 cups.
   - Total cost for 240 cups = \( 240 \times C \).

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of cups} = \text{Total cost of plates} - 1200
     \]
     \[
     240C = 36000 - 1200
     \]
     \[
     240C = 34800
     \]

6. **Solving for \( C \):**
   \[
   C = \frac{34800}{240} = 144.5
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The total cost of buying each cup is **\$144.50**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{144.50}
\]
