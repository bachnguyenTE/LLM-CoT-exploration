To determine how much money John makes in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the size of the third apartment complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined size of the first two.
   - Calculate 60% of 440 apartments: \(0.60 \times 440 = 264\) apartments.
   - Total apartments in the third complex: \(440 + 264 = 708\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments John collects from each complex:**
   - **First complex:** 200 apartments.
   - **Second complex:** 200 apartments.
   - **Third complex:** 708 apartments.

3. **Determine the total number of apartments collected in a week:**
   - **First complex:** \(200 \times 3 = 600\) collections.
   - **Second complex:** \(200 \times 3 = 600\) collections.
   - **Third complex:** \(708 \times 3 = 2124\) collections.
   - **Total collections per week:** \(600 + 600 + 2124 = 3384\) collections.

4. **Calculate the total payment per week:**
   - John is paid \$0.40 per collection.
   - **Total payment:** \(3384 \times 0.40 = 1353.60\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{1353.60}
