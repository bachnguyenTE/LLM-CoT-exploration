To determine how much John pays for driving in a year, let's break down the costs step by step.

### **1. Calculate the Total Miles Driven Each Week:**
- **One-way distance to work:** 30 miles
- **Return distance:** 30 miles
- **Total miles per day:** \( 30 + 30 = 60 \) miles

### **2. Calculate the Total Miles Driven Each Week:**
- **Workdays per week:** 5
- **Total miles per week:** \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) miles

### **3. Calculate the Total Miles Driven Each Year:**
- **Weeks per year:** 50
- **Total miles per year:** \( 330 \times 50 = 16,600 \) miles

### **4. Calculate the Cost of Driving:**
- **Cost per mile:** \$2
- **Total driving cost:** \( 16,600 \times 2 = \$33,200 \)

### **5. Calculate the Total Bonus Given to the Driver:**
- **Monthly bonus:** \$150
- **Total bonus per year:** \( 155 \times 50 = \$7,750 \)

### **6. Calculate the Total Annual Driving Cost:**
- **Total driving cost:** \$33,200
- **Total bonus:** \$7,750
- **Total annual cost:** \( 33,200 + 7,750 = \$40,950 \)

\[
\boxed{\$40,950}
