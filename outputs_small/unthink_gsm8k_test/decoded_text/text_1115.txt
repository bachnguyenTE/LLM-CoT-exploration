Q: Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. She had a budget of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost her the same amount of money. If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?

**Solution:**

Anna has a total budget of \$16 and has already spent \$4. She has \$2 left in her budget. She bought 2 books, each costing the same amount.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total budget} - \text{Amount spent} = \text{Amount left}
   \]
   
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12
   \]
   
   So, Anna spent \$12 in total.

2. **Determine the cost per book:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} \div \text{Number of books} = \text{Cost per book}
   \]
   
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]
   
   Therefore, each book costs **\$6**.

**Answer:**  
Each book costs \boxed{\$6}.
