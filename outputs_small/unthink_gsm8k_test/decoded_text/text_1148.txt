To determine how many eggs each child receives, follow these steps:

1. **Total number of eggs:** Chatty prepared **3 dozen eggs**. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, this means:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Number of children:** There are **4 children**.

3. **Eggs per child:** To find out how many eggs each child gets, divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ eggs}}{4 \text{ children}} = 9 \text{ eggs per child}
   \]

**Final Answer:** Each child receives \(\boxed{9}\) eggs.
