Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Adult ticket cost:** \$12
- **Child ticket cost:** \$10
- **Brittany's mom gives the cashier \$1 (1 child ticket) and \$1 (1 adult ticket).**
- **Change received:** \$8

**Let’s denote:**
- **Total cost for 1 adult ticket:** \$12
- **Total cost for 1 child ticket:** \$10
- **Total amount given to the cashier:** Let’s call this amount \( x \)

**Calculations:**
1. **Total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket:**
   \[
   \$12 \text{ (adult)} + \$10 \text{ (child)} = \$22
   \]
2. **Change received is the difference between the amount given and the total cost:**
   \[
   x - \$22 = \$8
   \]
3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \$8 + \$22 = \$30
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Brittany gave the cashier \(\boxed{30}\) dollars.
