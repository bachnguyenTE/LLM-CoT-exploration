To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount per blouse:**
   - **Original price per blouse:** \$20
   - **Discount:** 30% off
   - **Discount amount:** \( 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.3 = \$6 \)

2. **Determine the discounted price per blouse:**
   - **Discounted price:** \( 20 - 6 = \$14 \)

3. **Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:**
   - **Total cost:** \( 4 \times 14 = \$56 \)

**Final Answer:**  
The total cost of the discounted blouses is \(\boxed{56}\).
