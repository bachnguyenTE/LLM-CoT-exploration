Q: The amount of water passing through a river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - **Day 1:** 4000 gallons

2. **Effect of Heavy Rain on the Third Day:**
   - **Day 2:** The amount of water doubles.
     - Calculation: \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons
   - **Day 3:** The volume increases by 6000 gallons.
     - Calculation: \( 8000 + 6000 = 14800 \) gallons

3. **Total Amount of Water Over the Three Days:**
   - **Day 1:** 4000 gallons
   - **Day 2:** 8000 gallons
   - **Day 3:** 14800 gallons
   - **Total:** \( 4000 + 8000 + 14800 = 27200 \) gallons

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{27200}\) gallons
