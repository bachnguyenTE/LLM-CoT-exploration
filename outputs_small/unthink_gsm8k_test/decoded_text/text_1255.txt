To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Number of Plants:**
   - **Total plants:** 20

2. **Plants and Water Requirements:**
   - **4 plants:** Need **½ cup of water each.**
     - **Total water for these plants:** \( 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \) cups
   - **8 plants:** Need **1 cup of water each.**
     - **Total water for these plants:** \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) cups
   - **Remaining plants:** 
     - **Total plants accounted for:** \( 4 + 8 = 12 \)
     - **Remaining plants:** \( 20 - 12 = 8 \)
     - **Each of these 8 plants needs:** \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup of water
     - **Total water for these plants:** \( 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \) cups

3. **Total Water Required:**
   - **Total water:** \( 2 \) cups (for 4 plants) + \( 8 \) cups (for 8 plants) + \( 2 \) cups (for the remaining 8 plants) = \( 12 \) cups

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{12}\)
