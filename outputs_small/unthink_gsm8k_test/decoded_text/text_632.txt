Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Max bought **16** snowflake stamps.
- He bought **3** more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
- He bought **9** fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( S \) = number of snowflake stamps = 16
- Let \( T \) = number of truck stamps
- Let \( R \) = number of rose stamps

**Step 1: Find the number of truck stamps.**
\[
T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 9
\]

**Step 2: Find the number of rose stamps.**
\[
R = T - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0
\]

**Step3: Calculate the total number of stamps.**
\[
\text{Total Stamps} = S + T + R = 16 + 9 + 0 = 25
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
