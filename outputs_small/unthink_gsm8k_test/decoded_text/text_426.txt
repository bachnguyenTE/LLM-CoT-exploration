Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner.

1. **Bagel Cost:**
   - The bagel costs **\$4**.

2. **Soup Cost:**
   - Aleksandra ordered soup, which costs 25% more than the bagel.
   - **25% of \$4** is calculated as:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = \$1
     \]
   - Therefore, the soup costs:
     \[
     \$4 + \$1 = \$5
     \]

3. **Cake Cost:**
   - The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of \$4 is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = \$2
     \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, add up the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake:
     \[
     \$4 \, (\text{bagel}) + \$5 \, (\text{soup}) + \$2 \, \text{cake} = \$11
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
