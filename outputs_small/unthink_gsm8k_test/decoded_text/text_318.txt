**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - The classroom has **3 times as many girls as boys**.
   - The classroom has **1/10 as many nongendered children as boys**.
   - The number of **boys** in the classroom is **30**.

2. **Let’s denote:**
   - Let \( B \) = number of boys.
   - Let \( G \) = number of girls.
   - Let \( N \) = number of nongendered children.

3. **From the problem:**
   - \( B = 30 \) (given).
   - \( G = 3B \) (since there are 3 times as many girls as boys).
   - \( N = \frac{1}{10}B \) (since there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys).

4. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   \[
   G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
   
5. **Calculate the number of nongendered children:**
   \[
   N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]
   
6. **Calculate the total number of children:**
   \[
   \text{Total Children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{123}
\]
