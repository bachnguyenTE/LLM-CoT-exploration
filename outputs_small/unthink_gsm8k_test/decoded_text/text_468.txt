Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Fireman Frank starts with **200 shoes**.
- **Monday:** Gets **5 pairs** of shoes.
- **Wednesday:** Gains **15 new pairs**.
- **Friday:** Gets **30 pairs** of shoes.
- **Saturday:** Gets rid of **180 shoes**.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs received.**

- **Monday:** 5 pairs
- **Wednesday:** 15 pairs
- **Friday:** 30 pairs

Total pairs received = 5 + 15 + 30 = **50 pairs**

**Step 2: Convert pairs to individual shoes.**

- **Monday:** 5 pairs × 2 shoes/pair = **10 shoes**
- **Wednesday:** 15 pairs × 2 shoes/pair = **30 shoes**
- **Friday:** 30 pairs × 2 shoes/pair = **60 shoes**

Total shoes received = 10 + 30 + 60 = **100 shoes**

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of shoes after receiving.**

Starting shoes: 200

Total shoes after receiving = 200 + 100 = **300 shoes**

**Step 4: Subtract the number of shoes removed on Saturday.**

Shoes removed on Saturday: 180

Total shoes remaining = 300 - 180 = **120 shoes**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{120}
