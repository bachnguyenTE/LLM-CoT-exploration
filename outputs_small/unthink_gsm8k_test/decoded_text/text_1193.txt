**Solution:**

To determine how much Jason earned over the two-week period, we'll calculate his earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Laundry:**
   - Jason was told he could earn **\$3.00** for doing his laundry each week.
   - Over **2 weeks**, he did laundry **1 time**.
   - **Earnings from laundry:** \( 1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00 \)

2. **Cleaning His Room:**
   - He was told he could earn **\$1.50** for cleaning his room each week.
   - Over **2 weeks**, he cleaned his room **1 time**.
   - **Earnings from cleaning his room:** \( 1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50 \)

3. **Taking the Trash to the Curb:**
   - He was told he could earn **\$0.75** for taking the trash to the curb each week.
   - Over **2 weeks**, he took the trash out **2 times**.
   - **Earnings from taking trash:** \( 2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50 \)

4. **Emptying the Dishwasher:**
   - He was told he could earn **\$0.50** for emptying the dishwasher each week.
   - Over **2 weeks**, he emptied the dishwasher **6 times**.
   - **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:** \( 6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00 \)

**Total Earnings:**
\[
\$3.00 \ (\text{Laundry}) + \$1.50 \ (\text{Cleaning}) + \$1.50 \ (\text{Taking Trash}) + \$3.00 \ (\text{Dishwasher}) = \$9.00
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$9.00}
