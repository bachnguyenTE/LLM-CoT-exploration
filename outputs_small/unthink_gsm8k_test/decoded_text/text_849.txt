**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of trays:**
   
   The farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30 eggs.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   
   The farmer sells each tray for \$2.5.
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75.0
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$75.0}
\]
