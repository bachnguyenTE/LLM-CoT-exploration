To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- **1 person can paint half a house in 5 days.**
  
  This means:
  
  - **1 person paints 1/2 of a house in 5 days.**
  
- **We need to find out how long it takes for 5 people to paint **1 whole house**.**

### **Step 2: Calculate the Rate of One Person**

First, let's find out how much of the house one person can paint in one day.

- **1 person paints 1/2 of a house in 5 days.**
  
  So, the rate for one person is:
  
  \[
  \text{Rate per person} = \frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
  \]
  
  This means one person paints **1/10 of a house per day**.

### **Step 3: Calculate the Rate for 5 People**

Now, let's find out how much of the house 5 people can paint in one day.

- **5 people paint 5 × (1/10) = 5/10 = 1 house per day.**
  
  So, 5 people can paint **1 whole house in 1 day**.

### **Step 4: Convert Days to Hours**

Since the question asks for the time in hours, we need to convert days to hours.

- **1 day = 24 hours.**
  
  Therefore, 1 day = 24 hours.

### **Step 5: Final Answer**

Since 5 people can paint a whole house in **1 day**, which is **24 hours**, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{24 \text{ hours}}
\]
