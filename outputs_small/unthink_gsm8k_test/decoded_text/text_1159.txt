Q: Carla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?

To determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Octuplets:**
   - Carla has **3 octuplets** in purple and **1 octuplet** in blue.

2. **Wearing Bows:**
   - **All blue-wearers** wear a bow.
   - **1/3 of the purple wearers** wear a bow.

3. **Calculating Purple Wearers with Bows:**
   - **Purple wearers with a bow:** \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \) octuplet.

4. **Calculating Total Wearers with Bows:**
   - **Blue wearers with a bow:** \( 1 \) octuplet.
   - **Purple wearers with a bow:** \( 1 \) octuplet.
   - **Total wearers with a bow:** \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) octuplets.

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - **Probability of wearing purple and having a bow:** \( \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Percentage:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{50\%}\)
