To determine the total number of animal legs on the farm, we can break down the problem into two parts:

1. **Legs from 2-legged animals:**
   - There are 10 animals with 2 legs each.
   - Total legs = \( 10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Legs from 4-legged animals:**
   - There are 15 animals with 4 legs each.
   - Total legs = \( 15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Total legs on the farm:**
   - Add the legs from both groups of animals.
   - Total legs = \( 20 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 88 \text{ legs} \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{88}\)
