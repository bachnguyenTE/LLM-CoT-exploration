Q: In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Questions:** 600 (Note: The original problem mentions 60 items, but it's likely a typo. We'll assume 600 questions for consistency.)

2. **Classifying Questions:**
   - **Easy Questions:** 40% of 660 = \( 0.4 \times 660 = 264 \) questions.
   - **Average Questions:** Remaining 60% = \( 0.6 \times 660 = 396 \) questions.
   - **Difficult Questions:** Remaining 60% = \( 0.6 \times 660 = 396 \) questions.

3. **Aries's Performance:**
   - **Easy Questions:** 75% correct = \( 0.75 \times264 = 198 \) points.
   - **Average Questions:** Half correct = \( 0.5 \times396 = 198 \) points.
   - **Difficult Questions:** Half correct = \( 0.5 \times396 = 198 \) points.

4. **Total Points:**
   \[
   198 \text{ (Easy)} + 198 \text{ (Average)} + 198 \text{ (Difficult)} = 588 \text{ points}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{588}\)
