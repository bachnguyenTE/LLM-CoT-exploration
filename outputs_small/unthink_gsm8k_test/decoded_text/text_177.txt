Q: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?

**Solution:**

Let's break down Zaid's monthly expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Total Monthly Salary:**
   \[
   \$6,\!000
   \]

2. **Expenses:**
   - **Rent:**
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times \$6,\!000 = \$1,\!500
     \]
   - **Car Fuel:**
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \$6,\!0000 = \$2,\!000
     \]
   - **Remaining Amount After Rent and Fuel:**
     \[
     \$6,\!000 - \$1,\!500 - \$2,\!000 = \$2,\!500
     \]
   - **Charity Donation:**
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times \$2,\!500 = \$1,\!250
     \]
   - **Charity After Donation:**
     \[
     \$2,\!500 - \$1,\!250 = \$1,\!300
     \]

3. **Additional Expenses:**
   - **Daughter's Weekly Expenses:**
     \[
     \$2,\!000
     \]
   - **Wife's Weekly Budget:**
     \[
     \$7,\!000
     \]
   - **Total Additional Expenses:**
     \[
     \$2,\!000 + \$7,\!000 = \$9,\!000
     \]

4. **Total Expenses and Donations:**
   \[
   \$1,\!300 + \$9,\!000 = \$10,\!300
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After All Expenses:**
   \[
   \$6,\!600 - \$10,\!300 = -\$3,\!6999
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{-\$3,\!6999}
\]

Zaid will **debt** \$36,999 after all his expenses and donations.
