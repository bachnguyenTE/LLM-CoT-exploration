To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of buttons in the bag:**  
   There are **21 buttons** in the bag.

2. **Number of buttons with two holes:**  
   Seven buttons have **two holes each**.

3. **Number of buttons with four holes:**  
   The remaining buttons have **four holes each**.  
   - Total buttons: 21  
   - Buttons with two holes: 7  
   - Buttons with four holes: \(21 - 7 = 14\)

4. **Calculate the total number of holes:**
   - **Buttons with two holes:** \(7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes/button} = 14 \text{ holes}\)  
   - **Buttons with four holes:** \(14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes/button} = 56 \text{ holes}\)  
   - **Total holes:** \(14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes}\)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{70}
