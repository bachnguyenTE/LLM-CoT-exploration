Q: Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?

To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Probability of Each Ticket Winning:**
   - **First Ticket:** Mark has a 20% chance of winning.
     \[
     P(\text{First Ticket Wins}) = 20\% = 0.20
     \]
   - **Second Ticket:** It's three times more likely to win than the first ticket.
     \[
     P(\text{Second Ticket Wins}) = 3 \times 20\% = 60\% = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the Joint Probability of Both Tickets Winning:**
   - Assuming the outcomes are independent (the result of one ticket does not affect the other):
     \[
     P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = P(\text{First Ticket Wins}) \times P(\text{Second Ticket Wins})
     \]
     \[
     P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the Joint Probability to a Percentage:**
   \[
   0.12 \times 100\% = 12\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12\%}
\]
