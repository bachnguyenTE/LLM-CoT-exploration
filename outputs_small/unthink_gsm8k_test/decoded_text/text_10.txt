Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Downloads in the first month: 60
- Downloads in the second month: 3 times the first month
- Downloads in the third month: 30% less than the second month

**Step 1: Calculate Downloads in the Second Month**

The number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads in the first month.

\[
\text{Downloads in second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Downloads in the Third Month**

The downloads in the third month are reduced by 30% from the second month.

\[
\text{Reduction} = 30\% \times 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
\]

\[
\text{Downloads in third month} = 180 - 54 = 126
\]

**Step3: Calculate Total Downloads Over Three Months**

\[
\text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 372
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{372}
\]
