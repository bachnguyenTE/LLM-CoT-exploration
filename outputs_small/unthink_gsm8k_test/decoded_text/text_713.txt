**Solution:**

To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area that needs to be covered:**
   
   Mr. Boarden wants to cover **two-thirds** of his **36 square feet** bathroom.
   
   \[
   \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tiles needed per square foot:**
   
   Mr. Boarden needs **24 mosaic tiles** for every **1 square foot**.
   
   \[
   \text{Tiles per sq ft} = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tiles needed:**
   
   Multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot.
   
   \[
   \text{Total tiles} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Mr. Boarden would need \(\boxed{576}\) mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.
