**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The cost of the shoes is \$80.
   - The cost of the handbag is **\$20 less than 3 times** the cost of the shoes.

2. **Calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:**
   \[

   \]

3. **Subtract \$20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:**

   \]

**Final Answer:**
