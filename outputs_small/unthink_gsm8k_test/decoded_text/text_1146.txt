Q: Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Investment:**
   Adam invests all his \$100 in the rock stand.

2. **Cost of Rocks:**
   - Each rock costs \$5.
   - If he buys **x** rocks, his total cost is:
     \[
     5x = 100
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
     \]

3. **Selling Rocks:**
   - He sells each rock for \$7.
   - He sells **60%** of his inventory.
   - Number of rocks sold:
     \[
     0.60 \times 20 = 13.2 \text{ rocks}
     \]
     Since he can't sell a fraction of a rock, we'll consider 13 rocks sold.

4. **Revenue from Sales:**
   - Revenue from selling 13 rocks:
     \[
     13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adam initially invested \$100.

6. **Profit/Loss:**
   - Total revenue from sales: \$91
   - Total cost: \$100
   - **Loss:**
     \[
     100 - 91 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
