**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Deal:**
   - **Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.**
   - So, for every 2 scoops you buy, you get an additional free scoop.

2. **Determine the Cost per Scoop:**
   - Each scoop costs **\$1.50**.

3. **Calculate the Total Cost for 3 Scoops:**
   - **2 scoops bought** + **1 free scoop** = **3 scoops total**
   - **Cost for 2 scoops:** \( 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \)
   - **Total cost:** \( \$3.00 \)

4. **Check Erin's Budget:**
   - Erin has **\$6.00**.
   - **Number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \text{ sets}
     \]
   - **Total scoops from 2 sets:** \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) scoops.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Erin can buy **6 scoops** of ice cream with her \$6.00.

\boxed{6}
