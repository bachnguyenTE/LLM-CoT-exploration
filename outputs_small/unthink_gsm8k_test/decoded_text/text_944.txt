**Solution:**

To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we'll calculate the total earnings from each type of crop separately and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - **Number of yams:** 6
   - **Price per yam:** \$1.50
   - **Total earnings from yams:** \( 6 \times \$1.50 = \$9.00 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - **Number of sweet potatoes:** 10
   - **Price per sweet potato:** \$2.00
   - **Total earnings from sweet potatoes:** \( 10 \times \$2.00 = \$20.00 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - **Number of carrots:** 4
   - **Price per carrot:** \$1.250
   - **Total earnings from carrots:** \( 4 \times \$1.250 = \$5.00 \)

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - **Total from yams:** \$9.00
   - **Total from sweet potatoes:** \$20.00
   - **Total from carrots:** \$5.00
   - **Summing up:** \( \$9.00 + \$20.00 + \$5.00 = \$34.60 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$34.60}
\]
