Q: The power goes out in Brianna's house one night so she and her family gather all their candles and flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?

To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family has when the power goes out, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Number of Rooms:**
   - Total rooms in the house: **8**

2. **Number of People:**
   - Brianna and her family: **4 people**

3. **Flashlights:**
   - **1 flashlight per person to carry.**
   - **2 flashlights per room.**
   - **Total flashlights available:**
     \[
     \text{Total Flashlights} = (\text{Number of Rooms} \times 2) + (\text{Number of People} \times 1) = (8 \times 2) + (4 \times 1) = 16
     \]

4. **Candles:**
   - **4 small candles each for half the rooms.**
   - **5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms.**
   - **Total rooms: 8**
     - **Half the rooms:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) rooms
     - **Other half of the rooms:** \( 8 - 4 = 4 \) rooms
   - **Small Candles:**
     \[
     \text{Total Small Candles} = (\text{Number of Small Candles per Room} \times \text{Number of Rooms}) = (4 \times 4) = 16
     \]
   - **Medium Candles:**
     \[
     \text{Total Medium Candles} = (\text{Number of Medium Candles per Room} \times \text{Number of Rooms}) = (5 \times 4) = 20
     \]
   - **Total Candles:**
     \[
     \text{Total Candles} = \text{Total Small Candles} + \text{Total Medium Candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
     \]

5. **Total Items (Candles + Flashlights):**
   \[
   \text{Total Items} = \text{Total Flashlights} + \text{Total Candles} = 16 + 36 = 52
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{52}
\]
