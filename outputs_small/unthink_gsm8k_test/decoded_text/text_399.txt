**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( E \) represent Erica's age.
   - Let \( B \) represent Beth's age.
   - Let \( A \) represent Alice's age.

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - **Erica is 30 years old:** \( E = 30 \)
   - **Beth is 5 years older than Erica:** \( B = E + 5 \)
   - **Alice is 7 years older than Beth:** \( A = B + 7 \)

3. **Calculate Beth's Age:**
   \[
   B = E + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35
   \]

4. **Calculate Alice's Age:**
   \[
   A = B + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42
   \]

5. **Find the Difference Between Alice and Erica's Ages:**
   \[
   A - E = 42 - 30 = 12
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
