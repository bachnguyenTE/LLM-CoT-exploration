**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Items:**
   - Skipping rope: \$6
   - Board game: \$11
   - Playground ball: \$2

   **Total cost = \$6 + \$11 + \$2 = \$9**

2. **Total Money Dora Has:**
   - Saved money: \$2
   - Money received from mother: \$16

   **Total money = \$2 + \$16 = \$18**

3. **Amount of Money Dora Still Needs:**
   - **Total cost of items:** \$9
   - **Total money Dora has:** \$18

   **Amount needed = \$18 - \$9 = \$9**

**Final Answer:** Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball with **\$9** more.
