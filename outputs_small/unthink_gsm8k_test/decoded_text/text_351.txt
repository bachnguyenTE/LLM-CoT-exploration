Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many plant pots April has left after donating to the school.

1. **Daisy Pots:**
   - April needs **30 plant pots** for daisies.

2. **Rose Pots:**
   - She needs twice as many for roses as daisies.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) plant pots for roses.

3. **Total Pots Needed:**
   - Total pots = Daisies + Roses
   - Calculation: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) plant pots.

4. **Pots Already Bought:**
   - April had already bought **100 plant pots** from the garden center.

5. **Pots Left Over:**
   - Total pots bought: 100
   - Pots used: 90
   - Calculation: \( 100 - 90 = 10 \) plant pots left.

**Final Answer:**  
April has \(\boxed{10}\) plant pots left over.
