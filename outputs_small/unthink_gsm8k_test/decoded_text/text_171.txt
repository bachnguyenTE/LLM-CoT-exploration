To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we'll calculate the legs contributed by each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**:  
   - Number of spiders: 80  
   - Legs per spider: 8  
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \) legs

2. **Insects**:  
   - Number of insects: 90  
   - Legs per insect: 6  
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \) legs

3. **Rare Mutant Invertebrates**:  
   - Number of invertebrates: 3  
   - Legs per invertebrate: 10  
   - Total legs from invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \) legs

4. **Total Legs**:  
   - Sum of all legs: \( 640 + 540 + 30 = 1215 \) legs

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{1215}
