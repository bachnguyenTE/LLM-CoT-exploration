To determine the total area of Tom's house, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Bedrooms:**
   - Tom has **4 bedrooms**.
   - Each bedroom measures **20 feet by 12 feet**.
   
   **Area of one bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 20 \,00 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   
   **Total area of all bedrooms:**
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Living Room:**
   - The living room is **5 times bigger** than one bedroom.
   
   **Area of the living room:**
   \[
   5 \times 240 = 1,200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Remaining Area:**
   - The rest of the house is **1,000 square feet**.

4. **Total Area of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = \text{Bedrooms} + \text{Living Room} + \text{Remaining Area}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = 960 + 1,200 + 1,000 = 3,160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3160}
\]
