**Solution:**

David has \$12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts, each costing \$0.03.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bolts} \times \text{Cost per Bolt} = 16 \times \$0.03 = \$0.48
   \]

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount David has:**
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \$12.48 - \$0.48 = \$12.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$12.00}
\]
