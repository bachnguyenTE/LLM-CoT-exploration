Q: Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)

**Solution:**

We are given that the price of carrots increases by **5%** of the original price every year. The initial price of carrots is **\$120**.

To find the price after **3 years**, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over multiple years:

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Time}}
\]

Where:
- **Initial Price** = \$120
- **Rate** = 5% per year = 0.05
- **Time** = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
\]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.05) \):

\[
1 + 0.05 = 1.05
\]

Next, raise \( 1.05 \) to the power of 3:

\[
1.05^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.157625
\]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[
120 \times 1.157625 = 140.915
\]

Finally, round to the nearest integer:

\[
\boxed{141}
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{141}\)
