Q: Ted the T-Rex was planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.  He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we'll calculate the total amount required for both adults and children.

1. **Adults:**
   - **Number of adults:** 20
   - **Potato salad per adult:** 10 lbs
   - **Total for adults:** \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs

2. **Children:**
   - **Number of children:** 5
   - **Potato salad per child:** \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs
   - **Total for children:** \( 5 \times5 = 25 \) lbs

3. **Total potato salad needed:**
   - **Total:** \( 220 + 25 = 245 \) lbs

\[
\boxed{245}
