**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rong's Savings:**
   - Rong saves **20 coins** every month.
   - Over **10 years**, that's **10 × 12 = 120 months**.
   - Total coins saved by Rong = **20 coins/month × 120 months = 2400 coins**.

2. **Neil's Savings:**
   - Neil saves **2/5 times more** than Rong per month.
   - **2/5 times more** means **2/5 of 20 coins**.
   - **2/5 × 20 = 8 coins**.
   - So, Neil saves **20 + 8 = 30 coins** per month.
   - Total coins saved by Neil = **30 coins/month × 120 months = 3960 coins**.

3. **Total Coins Saved Together:**
   - **Rong's coins + Neil's coins = 2400 + 3960 = 6360 coins**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{6360}
