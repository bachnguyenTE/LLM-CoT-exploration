**Solution:**

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. To find out how many pairs he buys in a year, multiply the monthly purchase by 12:

\[
2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
\]

James spends a total of \$2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, divide the total annual expenditure by the number of pairs:

\[
\frac{\$2640}{24 \text{ pairs}} = \$110 \text{ per pair}
\]

**Answer:** James pays an average of \boxed{\$111} for each pair of shoes.
