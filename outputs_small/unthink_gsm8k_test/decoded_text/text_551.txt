**Solution:**

To determine how much change Carly gets back, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:**
   \[
   5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the potato fries:**
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$0.0
   \]
   (Note: The total cost is \$0.00, which is \$0.)

3. **Calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks:**
   \[
   5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10
   \]

4. **Add up all the costs:**
   \[
   \$20 \text{ (hamburgers)} + \$0.0 \text{ (potato fries)} + \$10 \text{ (fruit drinks)} = \$30
   \]

5. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Carly gave:**
   \[
   \$50 \text{ (fifty-dollar bill)} - \$30 = \$20
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$20}
\]
