**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to return:**
   
   Janeth borrowed \$2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \$2000 + 10\% \times \$2000 = \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:**
   
   Janeth is going to pay \$165 each month for 12 months.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Payment} = \$165 \times 12 = \$1980
   \]

3. **Calculate Janeth's remaining balance:**
   
   Subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance} = \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$220}
\]
