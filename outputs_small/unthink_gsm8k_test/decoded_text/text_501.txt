**Solution:**

To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, follow these steps:

1. **Find the total yarn used by both:**
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
   - Grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.
   - **Total yarn used:** \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \) skein.

2. **Convert skeins to yards:**
   - There are 364 yards in 1 skein.
   - **Total yards:** \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \) yards.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{273}
