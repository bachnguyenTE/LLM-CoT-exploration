A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Diapers:**
   - Jordan has **2 children**.
   - Each child requires **5 diaper changes** per day.
   - **Total diaper changes per day = 2 children × 5 diaper changes/child = 10 diaper changes.**

2. **Diapers Changed by Jordan's Wife:**
   - Jordan's **wife changes half of the diapers**.
   - **Diapers changed by the wife = 10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes.**

3. **Diapers Changed by Jordan:**
   - Since the total diaper changes per day are **10**, and the wife changes **5**, Jordan must change the remaining:
   - **Diapers changed by Jordan = 10 diaper changes - 5 diaper changes = 5 diaper changes.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
