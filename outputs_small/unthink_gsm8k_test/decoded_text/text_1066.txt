To determine how many pizzas are left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Glee Club:**
   - **Order:** 20 pizzas
   - **Eaten:** 70% of 20 pizzas
   - **Left:** 20 - (70% of 20) = 20 - 14.6 = 5.4 pizzas

2. **Football Team:**
   - **Order:** Twice as many as the glee club, so 2 × 20 = 40 pizzas
   - **Eaten:** 80% of 40 pizzas
   - **Left:** 44 - (80% of 44) = 44 - 35.2 = 8.8 pizzas

3. **Total Pizzas Left:**
   - Glee Club: 5.4 pizzas
   - Football Team: 8.8 pizzas
   - **Total:** 5.4 + 8.8 = 14.2 pizzas

**Final Answer:** \boxed{14.2}
