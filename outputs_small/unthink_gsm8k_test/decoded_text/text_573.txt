**Solution:**

Katina has an initial amount of money in her savings account, and she removes a fixed amount every month. We need to determine how much money will remain after a certain period.

**Given:**
- **Initial amount (P):** \$3,0000
- **Monthly withdrawal (R):** \$100
- **Time (t):** 2 years

**Steps to Calculate:**

1. **Convert Time to Months:**
   - 2 years = 2 × 12 = 24 months

2. **Calculate Total Withdrawals:**
   - Total withdrawals = Monthly withdrawal × Number of months
   - Total withdrawals = \$100 × 24 = \$2,400

3. **Calculate Remaining Amount:**
   - Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total withdrawals
   - Remaining amount = \$3,000 - \$2,400 = \$6,600

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$6,\!600}
\]
