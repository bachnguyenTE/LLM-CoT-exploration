**Solution:**

Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of water balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons they threw, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons initially filled:**
   
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons/pack} = 300 \text{ balloons}
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon:**
   
   \[
   330 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 320 \text{ balloons}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of balloons thrown:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{320}
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{320}\)
