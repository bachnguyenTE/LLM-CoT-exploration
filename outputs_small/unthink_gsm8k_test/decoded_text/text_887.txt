Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of birds Jerry counts.

1. **Number of birds nesting in the bushes:**
   - Jerry counts **6** birds.

2. **Number of birds flying overhead:**
   - It's given that **2/3rd of that number** of birds are flying overhead.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.

3. **Number of birds feeding:**
   - There are **3 groups** of **8 birds** each feeding.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

4. **Total number of birds:**
   - Add up all the birds:
     \[
     6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds}
     \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{34}\)
