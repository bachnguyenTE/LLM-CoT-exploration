**Solution:**

Greg found **\$20** and decided to split the money equally among himself and his **3 younger siblings**. This means the total number of people sharing the money is:

\[
1 \text{ (Greg)} + 3 \text{ (siblings)} = 4 \text{ people}
\]

To find out how much each person gets, divide the total amount of money by the number of people:

\[
\frac{\$20}{4} = \$5
\]

**Answer:** Each person gets \(\boxed{\$5}\).
