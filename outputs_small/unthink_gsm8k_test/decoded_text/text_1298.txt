To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we'll calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum them up.

1. **Quarters (25 cents each):**
   \[
   32 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 = \$8.00
   \]

2. **Dimes (10 cents each):**
   \[
   95 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10 = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Nickels (5 cents each):**
   \[
   120 \text{ nickels} \times \$0.05 = \$6.00
   \]

4. **Pennies (1 cent each):**
   \[
   750 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.010 = \$7.50
   \]

**Total Value:**
\[
\$8.00 + \$10.00 + \$6.00 + \$7.50 = \$31.50
\]

\[
\boxed{\$31.50}
\]
