To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, let's break down the consumption step by step.

**Family Composition:**
- **Total family members:** 5
- **Eating habits:**
  - **Three people:** Eat **3 eggs** each day.
  - **Two people:** Eat **2 eggs** each day.

**Daily Consumption:**
- **Three people:** \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 3 \text{ people} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \)
- **Two people:** \( 2 \text{ eggs/day} \times 2 \text{ people} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \)
- **Total daily consumption:** \( 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \)

**Weekly Consumption:**
- **1 week:** \( 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs/week} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{91}
\]
