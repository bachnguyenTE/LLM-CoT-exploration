Q: A three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?

To determine the least number of berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Total Time and Goal:**
   - **Total Time Available:** 8 hours
   - **Goal:** Collect **24 berries**

2. **Analyze the Sloth's Movement:**
   - **Time per Trip:**
     - **Down the tree:** 4 hours
     - **Pick up berries:** (Assuming this is instantaneous)
     - **Up the tree:** 4 hours
   - **Total Time per Trip:** 4 hours (down) + 4 hours (up) = **8 hours**

3. **Determine the Number of Trips:**
   - Since the total time available is exactly **8 hours**, the sloth can make **1 full round trip** (down and up) in the given time.

4. **Calculate Berries per Trip:**
   - **Total Berries Needed:** 24
   - **Number of Trips:** 1
   - **Berries per Trip:** \( \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{1 \text{ trip}} = 24 \text{ berries per trip} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
