**Solution:**

1. **Determine Karen's hourly wage:**
   - Lorie earns \$10 per hour.
   - Karen earns twice what Lorie earns.
   - **Karen's hourly wage = 2 × Lorie's hourly wage = 2 × \$10 = \$20 per hour.**

2. **Calculate Karen's earnings for two days:**
   - Karen works **3 hours per day**.
   - **Daily earnings = 3 hours/day × \$20/hour = \$60 per day.**
   - **Total earnings for two days = 2 days × \$60/day = \$120.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$120}
