To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we'll use the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

1. **Calculate the distance for each part of the trip:**
   
   - **First part:**  
     Speed = 60 mph  
     Time = 2 hours  
     Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

   - **Second part:**  
     Speed = 30 mph  
     Time = 1 hour  
     Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the total distance and total time:**
   
   - **Total Distance:** 120 miles + 30 miles = 153 miles  
   - **Total Time:** 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{153 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 51 \text{ mph}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{51}
