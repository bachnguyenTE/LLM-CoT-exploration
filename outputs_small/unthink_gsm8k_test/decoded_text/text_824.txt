**Solution:**

To determine how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought compared to dog food, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cat food tins:**
   \[
   \text{Total cat food tins} = \text{Number of cat food packages} \times \text{tins per package} = 8 \times 111 = 88 \text{ tins}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of dog food tins:**
   \[
   \text{Total dog food tins} = \text{Number of dog food packages} \times \text{tins per package} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins}
   \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of tins:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total cat food tins} - \text{Total dog food tins} = 88 - 36 = 52 \text{ tins}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{52}
\]
