Q: Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as jack. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J_s \) = number of socks Jack has
   - Let \( J_d \) = number of dishes Jack has
   - Let \( P_s \) = number of socks Peter has
   - Let \( P_d \) = number of dishes Peter has

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - **Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:**
     \[
     P_s = 2 \times J_s
     \]
   - **Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack:**
     \[
     P_d = \frac{1}{2} \times J_d
     \]
   - **Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store:**
     \[
     J_d = 2 \times J_s
     \]
   - **Jack collected 60 dishes:**
     \[
     J_d = 60
     \]

3. **Find the Number of Socks Jack Has:**
   \[
   J_d = 2 \times J_s \implies 60 = 2 \times J_s \implies J_s = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   So, Jack has **30 socks**.

4. **Find the Number of Socks Peter Has:**
   \[
   P_s = 2 \times J_s = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   So, Peter has **60 socks**.

5. **Find the Number of Dishes Peter Has:**
   \[
   P_d = \frac{1}{2} \times J_d = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]
   So, Peter has **33 dishes**.

6. **Calculate the Total Number of Socks and Dishes:**
   \[
   \text{Total Socks} = J_s + P_s = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Dishes} = J_d + P_d = 60 + 33 = 93
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 90 + 93 = 183
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{183}
\]
