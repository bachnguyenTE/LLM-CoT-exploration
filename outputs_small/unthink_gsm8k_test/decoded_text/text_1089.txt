Q: Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?

**Solution:**

To determine how high the bouncy ball goes on its second bounce, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initial Drop:**
   - **Height of the balcony:** 24 feet.

2. **First Bounce:**
   - **Bounce ratio:** 2/3.
   - **Height after first bounce:** \( 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \) feet.

3. **Second Bounce:**
   - **Height after first bounce:** 16 feet (since \( 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = 10.666... \) feet).
   - **Height after second bounce:** \( 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \) feet.

**Final Answer:**
The ball reaches a height of **4 feet** on its second bounce.

\boxed{4}
