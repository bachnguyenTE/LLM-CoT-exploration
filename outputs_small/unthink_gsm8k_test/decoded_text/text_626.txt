To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Ashley's internet speed is **20 kb per second**.
   - **1 Mb = 1000 kb**.

2. **Convert kb to Mb:**
   - Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, Ashley's speed in Mb per second is:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

3. **Convert seconds to hours:**
   - There are **60 seconds in a minute** and **60 minutes in an hour**.
   - Therefore, there are:
     \[
     60 \text{ s/min} \times 60 \text{ min/h} = 3960 \text{ s/h}
     \]
   - To find the speed in Mb per hour:
     \[
     0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3960 \text{ s/h} = 79.2 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{79.2 \text{ Mb/h}}
\]
