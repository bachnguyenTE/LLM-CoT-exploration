**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of meals per day:**
   - Each person eats rice for 2 meals (lunch and dinner).
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Total meals per day = \( 5 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ meals/member} = 10 \text{ meals/day} \).

2. **Calculate the daily rice consumption:**
   - Each meal consumes \( 0.2 \text{ kg} \) of rice.
   - Daily rice consumption = \( 10 \text{ meals/day} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \).

3. **Determine how many days the rice will last:**
   - Total rice available = \( 42 \text{ kg} \).
   - Number of days = \( \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert days to weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Number of weeks = \( \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \).

**Final Answer:**  
The 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks.
