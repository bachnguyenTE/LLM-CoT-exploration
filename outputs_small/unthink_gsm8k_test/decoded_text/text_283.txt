Q: Katerina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?

To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Topaz gemstones per necklace:** 8
- **Length of each topaz gemstone:** 1 inch
- **Length of each sterling silver bead:** \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch
- **Total length of the necklace:** 25 inches

**Step 1: Calculate the total length occupied by topaz gemstones.**

\[
\text{Total length of gemstones} = \text{Number of gemstones} \times \text{Length per gemstone} = 8 \times 1\,000 = 8\,000 \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining length for beads.**

\[
\text{Total necklace length} - \text{Total length of gemstones} = 25\,000 - 8,000 = 17\,000 \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of beads needed.**

\[
\text{Number of beads} = \frac{\text{Remaining length}}{\text{Length per bead}} = \frac{17\,000}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17\,000 \times 4 = 68\,000 \text{ beads}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{68000}
\]
