To determine Wilson's current math grade, follow these steps:

1. **Add up all the test scores:**
   \[
   65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 390
   \]

2. **Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of tests (5):**
   \[
   \frac{390}{5} = 78
   \]

Wilson's current math grade is \(\boxed{78}\).
