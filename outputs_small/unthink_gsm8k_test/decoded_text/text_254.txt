Q: Shelly's 3 kids spent all day at the water park.  Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel and Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne.  How many times did Robert go down the water slide?

Let's determine how many times Robert went down the water slide step by step.

1. **Mitchel's Slides:**
   - **Total slides:** 30 times.

2. **Anne's Slides:**
   - Anne went down the slide **30% less** than Mitchel.
   - To find 30% of 30: 
     \[
     30\% \times 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 10.5
     \]
   - Subtract this from 30 to find Anne's total:
     \[
     30 - 10.5 = 19.5
     \]
   - Since the number of slides must be a whole number, we'll consider 19.5 as the exact value for now.

3. **Robert's Slides:**
   - Robert went down **4 times** as much as Anne.
   - Multiply Anne's total by 4:
     \[
     19.5 \times 4 = 78
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{78}
