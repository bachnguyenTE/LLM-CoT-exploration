Let's determine the number of white hats Skyler has step by step.

1. **Total Hats:** Skyler has **100 hats**.

2. **Red Hats:**
   - Half of the hats are red.
   - Number of red hats = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.

3. **Remaining Hats After Red:**
   - Total hats - Red hats = \( 100 - 55 = 45 \) hats remaining.

4. **Blue Hats:**
   - \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue.
   - Number of blue hats = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 45 = 27 \) hats.

5. **White Hats:**
   - The rest are white hats.
   - Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats = \( 100 - 55 - 27 = 18 \) hats.

**Final Answer:** Skyler has **18 white hats**.
