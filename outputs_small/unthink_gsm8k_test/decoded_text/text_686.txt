Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Greta's Cookies:**
   - Greta bakes **30 cookies**.

2. ** Celinda's Cookies:**
   - Celinda bakes **twice as many** as Greta.
   - So, Celinda bakes \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cookies.

3. **Total Cookies Baked:**
   - Greta: 30
   - Celinda: 60
   - **Total = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies**

4. **Cookies Eaten:**
   - The pair eats **10 cookies** while cooling.

5. **Cookies Left in the Box:**
   - Total cookies baked: 90
   - Cookies eaten: 10
   - **Cookies in the box = 90 - 10 = 80 cookies**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{80}\)
