**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Pricing:**
   - **First glass:** \$5
   - **Second glass:** 60% of \$5
   - **Third glass:** \$5
   - **Fourth glass:** 60% of \$5
   - And so on...

2. **Calculating the Cost for Two Glasses:**
   - First glass: \$5
   - Second glass: \( 0.60 \times 5 = \$3.0 \)
   - Total for two glasses: \$5 + \$3.0 = \$8.00

3. **Determining the Number of Pairs:**
   - Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.
   - Number of pairs = \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) pairs

4. **Calculating the Total Cost:**
   - Cost for 8 pairs: \( 8 \times \$8.00 = \$64.00 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$64.00}
\]
