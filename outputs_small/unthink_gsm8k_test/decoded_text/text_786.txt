To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can grow, we'll calculate the yield from each type of plant separately and then sum them up.

1. **Tomatoes:**
   - Each tomato plant yields **22 tomatoes**.
   - Ricardo planted **5 tomato plants**.
   - **Total tomatoes** = \( 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \).

2. **Eggplants:**
   - Each eggplant plant yields **4 eggplants**.
   - Ricardo planted **8 eggplant plants**.
   - **Total eggplants** = \( 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \).

3. **Total Fruits:**
   - **Total tomatoes + Total eggplants** = \( 110 + 32 = 142 \text{ fruits} \).

**Final Answer:**  
Ricardo can grow a total of \(\boxed{142}\) fruits from his plants.
