Q: Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?

**Solution:**

To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Distance to Hike:**
   - She plans to hike **9,300 miles** in June.

2. **Number of Days in June:**
   - June has **30 days**.

3. **Current Hiking Schedule:**
   - She will hike **2 times a day**.
   - Each hike covers **125 miles**.

4. **Total Miles Hiked Currently:**
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Hikes per day} \times \text{Miles per hike} = 30 \times 2 \times 125 = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Remaining Miles to Complete the Journey:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining miles} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Current miles} = 9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Current Daily Hiking Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Current daily miles} = \frac{\text{Current miles}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{7,500}{30} = 233.\overline{3} \text{ miles per day}
   \]

7. **Required Daily Hiking Distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required daily miles} = \frac{\text{Remaining miles}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{1,800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

8. **Additional Miles per Day Needed:**
   \[
   \text{Additional miles per day} = \text{Required daily miles} - \text{Current daily miles} = 60 - 233.\overline{3} = -173.\overline{3}
   \]

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because you can't hike a negative number of miles. It seems there's a mistake in the calculation.

**Re-evaluating the Steps:**

Let's correct the approach.

1. **Total Distance to Hike:**
   - **9,300 miles**

2. **Number of Days in June:**
   - **30 days**

3. **Current Hiking Schedule:**
   - **2 times a day**
   - **125 miles each time**

4. **Total Miles Hiked Currently:**
   \[
   30 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} \times 125 \text{ miles/hike} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Remaining Miles:**
   \[
   9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. **Current Daily Hiking Distance:**
   \[
   \frac{7,500}{30} = 250 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

7. **Required Daily Hiking Distance:**
   \[
   \frac{1,800}{30} = 60 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

8. **Additional Miles per Day Needed:**
   \[
   60 - 250 = -195
   \]

Again, we get a negative number, which doesn't make sense. It indicates that Soledad is already hiking faster than needed to complete the journey on time.

**Conclusion:**
Soledad does not need to hike any additional miles per day to complete her journey on time. She is already hiking faster than required.
