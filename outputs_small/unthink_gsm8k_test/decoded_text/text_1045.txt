Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total amount = \$1920
- Let the share of the first person be \( x \).
- The second person took \$80 more than the first, so their share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second took, so their share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

**Setting up the equation:**
\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

**Simplifying the equation:**
\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]
\[
4x + 248 = 1920
\]

**Solving for \( x \):**
\[
4x = 1920 - 248
\]
\[
4x = 1672
\]
\[
x = \frac{1672}{4}
\]
\[
x = 168
\]

**Answer:**
The first person received \(\boxed{168}\) dollars.
