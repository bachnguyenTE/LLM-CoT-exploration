**Solution:**

Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is \( 4x \) feet.

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 4x = 40
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
5x = 40
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, and the longer piece is:

\[
4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet}
\]

**Answer:** The longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet long.
