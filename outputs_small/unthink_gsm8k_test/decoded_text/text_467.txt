**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Requirements per Room:**
   - Each room has **2 sheets**.
   - The number of **pillow cases** is **twice the number of sheets**, so:
     \[
     \text{Pillow Cases} = 2 \times \text{Sheets} = 2 \times 2 = 4
     \]
   - The number of **towels** is **twice the number of pillow cases**, so:
     \[
     \text{Towels} = 2 \times \text{Pillow Cases} = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]

2. **Total Items per Room:**
   - **Sheets:** 2
   - **Pillow Cases:** 4
   - **Towels:** 8
   - **Total Items per Room:** 
     \[
     2 + 4 + 8 = 14
     \]

3. **Total Items for 80 Rooms:**
   - Multiply the total items per room by the number of rooms:
     \[
     14 \times 80 = 1148
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1148}
\]
