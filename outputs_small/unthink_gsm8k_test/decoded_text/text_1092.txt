Q: A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

1. **Let \( x \) be the total kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.**

2. **Tyrannosaurus Rex Ate Half:**
   - The T-Rex ate half of the meat.
   - **Meat remaining after T-Rex ate:** \( \frac{x}{2} \)

3. **Velociraptors Scavenged Half:**
   - The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
   - **Meat remaining after velociraptors scavenged:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \)

4. **Allosaurus Gulsed Down the Last 270 kg:**
   - The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kg.
   - **Equation:** \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270 \\
   x = 270 \times 4 \\
   x = 1080
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{1080}\) kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.
