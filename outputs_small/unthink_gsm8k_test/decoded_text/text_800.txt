**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Pierson's Score:**
   - Pierson scored **278 points** in one game of bowling.

2. **Nikita's Score:**
   - Nikita scored **11 more than half as many as Pierson**.
   - First, find half of Pierson's score:
     \[
     \frac{278}{2} = 139
     \]
   - Then, add 11 to this amount:
     \[
     139 + 11 = 150
     \]
   - So, Nikita scored **150 points**.

3. **Total Score:**
   - To find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita:
     \[
     278 \text{ (Pierson)} + 150 \text{ (Nikita)} = 428
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{428}
\]
