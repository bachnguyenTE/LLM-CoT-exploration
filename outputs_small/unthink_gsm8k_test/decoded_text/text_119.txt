Q: Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Adrien's total salary four years ago was **\$40,0000** (assuming a typo in the original problem, as it's unusual to have a comma in the number).
- Adrien's salary was **30% higher** than Lylah's salary four years ago.

**Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**

Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.

Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's:
\[
A = L + 0.30L = 1.30L
\]
Given \( A = \$40,0000 \):
\[
1.30L = 44,0000 \\
L = \frac{44,0000}{1.30} \approx 33,846.15
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**

Lylah's salary increased by 40% over four years:
\[
L_{\text{future}} = L + 0.40L = 1.40L
\]
\[
L_{\text{future}} = 1.40 \times 33,846.15 \approx 47,384.61
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**

Adrien's salary increased by 30% over four years:
\[
A_{\text{future}} = A + 0.30A = 1.30A
\]
\[
A_{\text{future}} = 1.30 \times 44,0000 \approx 57,2000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total salary four years later.**

\[
\text{Total Future Salary} = A_{\text{future}} + L_{\text{future}} \approx 57,2000 + 47,384.61 \approx 104,584.61
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{104,\!584.61}
\]
