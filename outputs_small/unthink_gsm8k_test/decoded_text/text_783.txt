Q: Bob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Bob initially has **7** fish in his ornamental fish pond.
- **3** of these fish are orange.
- **4** of these fish are white.
- Bob buys **17** more fish from the pet store.
- After adding the new fish, the number of **orange** fish is **twice** the number of **white** fish**.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let **\( w \)** be the number of white fish Bob bought.
- Therefore, the number of orange fish Bob bought is **\( 17 - w \)**.

**After buying the new fish:**
- Total orange fish = **3 (original) + (17 - w) (new)**
- Total white fish = **4 (original) + w (new)**

**According to the problem:**
\[
\text{Total orange fish} = 2 \times \text{Total white fish}
\]
\[
3 + (17 - w) = 2 \times (4 + w)
\]

**Solve the equation:**
\[
20 - w = 8 + 2w
\]
\[
20 - 8 = 2w + w
\]
\[
12 = 3w
\]
\[
w = 4
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
