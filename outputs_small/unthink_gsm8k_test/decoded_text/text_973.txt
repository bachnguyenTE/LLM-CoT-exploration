It seems like you've provided a question about the number of states in India and the USA, but the question itself is incomplete. Let's break it down and solve it step by step.

**Given:**
- India has **4 more than half the number of states in the USA**.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( A \) be the number of states in the USA.
- Then, the number of states in India is \( \frac{A}{2} + 4 \).

**Objective:**
Find the total number of states in both countries together, i.e., \( A + \left( \frac{A}{2} + 4 \right) \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Express the total number of states:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = A + \left( \frac{A}{2} + 4 \right)
   \]

2. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = A + \frac{A}{2} + 4 = \frac{3A}{2} + 4
   \]

3. **However, we need a numerical value for the total. To find this, we need the actual number of states in the USA.**

4. **Number of states in the USA:**
   - The United States has **50 states** (including the District of Columbia).

5. **Plug the value into the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{156}{2} + 4 = 78 + 4 = 82
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{82}
\]
