Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many men can stay upright on a 30-foot wave.

1. **Total Riders:** There are 100 riders in total.

2. **Women Riders:** 60% of the riders are women.
   \[
   \text{Number of women riders} = 60\% \times 100 = 66
   \]

3. **Men Riders:** Since 66% are women, the remaining percentage are men.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of men riders} = 100\% - 66\% = 34\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of men riders} =34\% \times 100 = 34
   \]

4. **Women on the Wave:** 60% of the riders are women.
   \[
   \text{Number of women on the wave} =66
   \]

5. **Men on the Wave:** Since there are 34 men in total and 66 women, the number of men on the wave is:
   \[
   \text{Number of men on the wave} =34 -66 =28
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{28}\)
