Q: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.  There is a total of 341 cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.  How many cards does Becca have?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( P \) = number of Magic Cards that PJ has.
- \( S \) = number of Magic Cards that Smendrick has.
- \( B \) = number of Magic Cards that Becca has.

**Given:**
1. The total number of Magic Cards is 341.
   \[
   P + S + B = 341
   \]
2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]
3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \).
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( S = 3P \) and \( B = 3P + 12 \) into the total equation.
\[
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
\]

**Step 3:** Combine like terms.
\[
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

**Step 4:** Subtract 12 from both sides.
\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

**Step 5:** Divide both sides by 7.
\[
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

**Step 6:** Find \( S \) using \( S = 3P \).
\[
S = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]

**Step 7:** Find \( B \) using \( B = S + 12 \).
\[
B = 141 + 12 = 153
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{153}
\]
