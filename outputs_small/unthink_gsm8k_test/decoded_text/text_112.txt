**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Teachers:** There are 4 teachers who share the whiteboard.

2. **Lessons per Teacher per Day:** Each teacher takes 2 lessons per day.

3. **Whiteboard Usage per Lesson:** The whiteboard is used by each teacher in every lesson.

4. **Cleaning Frequency:** The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

**Calculation:**

- **Total Lessons per Day:** 
  \[
  4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}
  \]

- **Total Cleanings per Lesson:** 3 cleanings per lesson.

- **Total Cleanings per Day:**
  \[
  8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}
  \]

**Final Answer:** The whiteboard is cleaned **24 times** in a day.
