Q: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold.

**Given:**
- Total eggs painted: 56
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.
- Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( A \) = number of eggs painted by Arnold
- Let \( M \) = number of eggs painted by Madeline
- Let \( C \) = number of eggs painted by Camden
- Let \( S \) = number of eggs painted by Sarah

**From the problem:**
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
   \[
   A = M
   \]
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs:
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]
4. Total eggs painted:
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

**Step 1: Substitute \( A = M \) into the total eggs equation:**
\[
A + A + C + S = 56 \\
2A + C + S = 56
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation:**
\[
2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \\
2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \\
2A + 2S = 56 - 12 \\
2A + 2S = 44 \\
Divide both sides by 2:
\]
\[
A + S = 22
\]

**Step 3: Now, we have two equations:**
1. \( A + S = 22 \)
2. \( C = S + 12 \)

**Step 4: Substitute \( A = 22 - S \) into the total eggs equation:**
\[
2A + C + S = 56 \\
2(22 - S) + (S + 12) + S = 56 \\
44 - 2S + S + 12 + S = 56 \\
44 + 12 + (-2S + S + S) = 56 \\
46 + 0 = 56 \\
\]

Wait, this doesn't make sense. Let's check our steps.

**Re-examining Step 1:**
\[
2A + C + S = 56 \\
But we have \( C = S + 12 \), so:
\[
2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \\
2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \\
2A + 2S = 45 \\
Divide both sides by 2:
\]
\[
A + S = 22.5
\]

This result doesn't make sense because the number of eggs should be a whole number. It seems there's an inconsistency in the problem statement or our interpretation.

**Re-examining the problem statement:**
- Total eggs: 56
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number.
- Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.
- Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.

Let's try solving it again with correct substitutions.

**Let’s define variables again:**
- \( A \) Arnold
- \( M \) Madeline
- \( C \) Camden
- \( S \) Sarah

**Given:**
1. \( A = M \)
2. \( C + S = 30 \)
3. \( C = S + 12 \)
4. \( A + M + C + S = 56 \)

**Step 1: Substitute \( A = M \) into total eggs:**
\[
A + A + C + S = 56 \\
2A + C + S = 56
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation:**
\[
2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \\
2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \\
2A + 2S = 56 - 12 \\
2A + 2S = 44 \\
Divide both sides by 2:
\]
\[
A + S = 22
\]

**Step 3: Now, we have two equations:**
1. \( A + S = 22 \)
2. \( C = S + 12 \)

**Step
