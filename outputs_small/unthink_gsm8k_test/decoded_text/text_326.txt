Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - **People on the bus at the terminal:** Let's denote this number as \( x \).

2. **First Bus Stop:**
   - **People got in:** 5
   - **Total people on the bus:** \( x + 5 \)

3. **Second Bus Stop:**
   - **People got down:** 7
   - **People got on:** 8
   - **Change in total people on the bus:** \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \)

4. **Total People heading to the Third Stop:**
   - According to the problem, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.
   - Therefore, \( x + 6 = 22 \)

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 6 = 22 \\
   x = 22 - 6 \\
   x = 16
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{16}\)
