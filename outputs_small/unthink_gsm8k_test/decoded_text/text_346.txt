**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cookies in a Bag:**
   - Jenny buys **1 bag** of cookies every week.
   - Each bag contains **36 cookies**.

2. **Cookies Placed in Son's Lunch Box:**
   - Jenny puts **4 cookies** in her son's lunch box **5 days a week**.
   - **Cookies eaten by Jenny in her son's lunch box:** \( 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \).

3. **Cookies Eaten by Her Husband:**
   - Her husband eats **1 cookie** every day for **7 days**.
   - **Cookies eaten by her husband:** \( 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \).

4. **Total Cookies Consumed by Jenny and Her Husband:**
   - **Total cookies eaten:** \( 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \).

5. **Cookies Remaining for Jenny to Eat:**
   - **Total cookies in the bag:** \( 36 \text{ cookies} \).
   - **Cookies eaten by others:** \( 27 \text{ cookies} \).
   - **Cookies Jenny eats:** \( 36 - 27 = -11 \text{ cookies} \).

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because you can't eat a negative number of cookies. Let's re-examine the calculations.

**Re-examining the husband's consumption:**
- **Husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days:** \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \text{ cookies} \).

**Re-examining the total consumption:**
- **Jenny eats 27 cookies to her son and husband.**
- **Total cookies in the bag:** \( 36 \text{ cookies} \).
- **Cookies left for Jenny to eat:** \( 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ cookies} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
