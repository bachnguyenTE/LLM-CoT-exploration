**Solution:**

Tracy used a piece of wire that was **4 feet long** to support tomato plants in her garden. She cut this wire into smaller pieces, each **6 inches long**. We need to determine how many such pieces she obtained.

**Step 1: Understand the Conversion**

First, it's important to note that the wire was originally **4 feet long**, and she cut it into pieces that are **6 inches long**. To find out how many 6-inch pieces she can get from a 4-foot wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into the same unit as the pieces.

**Step 2: Convert Feet to Inches**

Since the pieces are measured in inches, we'll convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.

- **1 foot = 12 inches**
- **4 feet = 4 × 12 inches = 48 inches**

**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Pieces**

Now, we have a total length of **48 inches** and each piece is **6 inches long**. To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length by the length of each piece.

\[
\text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Length of each piece}} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches}} = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**

Tracy obtained **8 pieces** of wire.
