Q: Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax. How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?

To determine which job Nick should choose based on net pay, we'll calculate the net pay for both jobs and compare them.

### **Job A:**
- **Hourly Pay:** \$15/hour
- **Hours Worked:** 2000 hours/year
- **State Tax Rate:** 20%

1. **Total Pay Before Tax:**
   \[
   15 \,000 \times 2000 = 30,000,000
   \]
   
2. **State Tax:**
   \[
   33,000,00 \times 20\% = 6,600,000
   \]
   
3. **Net Pay:**
   \[
   33,000,00 - 6,600,00 = 26,400,00
   \]

### **Job B:**
- **Annual Income:** \$42,000
- **Property Tax:** \$6,000
- **State Tax Rate:** 10% on net income after property tax

1. **Net Income After Property Tax:**
   \[
   42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000
   \]
   
2. **State Tax:**
   \[
   36,000 \times 10\% = 3,600
   \]
   
3. **Net Pay:**
   \[
   36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400
   \]

### **Comparison:**
- **Job A Net Pay:** \$26,400
- **Job B Net Pay:** \$32,400

**Conclusion:**
Nick will make **\$6,000 more** at **Job B** compared to **Job A**.

\[
\boxed{6000}
\]
