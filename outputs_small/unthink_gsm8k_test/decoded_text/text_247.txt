To determine how much each person paid, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the party supplies:**
   \[
   \$12 \,000 \text{ (ingredients)} + \$43,00 \text{ (birthday presents)} + \$15,00 \text{ (decorations)} + \$4,00 \text{ (invitations)} + \$22,00 \text{ (goodie bags)} = \$86,00
   \]

2. **Split the total cost evenly among Isabelle and her two parents (3 people):**
   \[
   \frac{\$86,00}{3} = \$28,67
   \]

**Answer:** Each person paid **\$28.67**.
