**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.
   - A pencil costs \$1.20.
   - An eraser costs \$0.30.

2. **Let’s denote the costs:**
   - Let \( P \) be the cost of one pen.
   - Let \( E \) be the cost of one eraser (which is given as \$0.30).
   - Let \( C \) be the cost of one pencil (which is given as \$1.20).

3. **From the problem statement:**
   \[
   P = C + E
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]
   So, one pen costs \$1.50.

4. **Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \times P = 8 \times 1.50
   \]
   
5. **Calculating the total cost:**
   \[
   8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
   \]
   
6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{12.00}
   \]

**Answer:** The total cost for 8 pens is \$12.00.
