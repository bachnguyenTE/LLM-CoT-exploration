To determine Charlotte's total order after the 20% discount, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - **Pot and pans:** \$120.0
   - **Mixing bowls:** \$20.00
   - ** Utensils:** 5 utensils × \$5.00 = \$25.00
   - **Total before discount:** \$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00 = **\$167.00**

2. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - **Discount amount:** 20% of \$167.00 = 0.20 × \$167.00 = **\$33.40**
   - **Total after discount:** \$167.00 - \$33.40 = **\$133.60**

 Charlotte's total order after the 20% discount is:

\[
\boxed{\$133.60}
