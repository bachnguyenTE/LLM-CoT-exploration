**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes daily:**
   
   - Jewel processes **50 customers** per day.

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes daily:**
   
   - Julie operates the cash register **exactly twice as fast** as Jewel.
   - If Jewel processes 50 customers in a day, Julie processes **2 × 50 = 100 customers** per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by both in a day:**
   
   - **Jewel:** 50 customers
   - **Julie:** 100 customers
   - **Total per day:** 50 + 100 = **150 customers**

4. **Calculate the total number of customers processed in a week:**
   
   - Assuming they work **5 days a week**:
   - **Total per week:** 150 × 5 = **750 customers**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{755}
