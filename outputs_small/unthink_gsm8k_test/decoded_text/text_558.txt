**Solution:**

Let's determine the size of each person's locker step by step.

1. **Timothy's Locker:**
   - **Volume:** 24 cubic inches.

2. **Zack's Locker:**
   - Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's.
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \, \text{cubic inches} = 12 \,004 \, \text{cubic inches} \).

3. **Peter's Locker:**
   - Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's.
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \,04 \, \text{cubic inches} = 3,04 \,04 \,04 \,04 \,04 \, \text{cubic inches} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3,\!04,\!04}
\]
