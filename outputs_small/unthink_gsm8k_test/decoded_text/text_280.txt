**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Peter paid, we'll calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost of Popsicles:**
   - Number of popsicles: 20
   - Cost per popsicle: \$0.25
   - Total cost for popsicles = 20 × \$0.25 = \$5.00

2. **Cost of Ice Cream Bars:**
   - Number of ice cream bars: 4
   - Cost per ice cream bar: \$0.50
   - Total cost for ice cream bars = 4 × \$0.50 = \$2.00

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
   - Total cost = \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$7.00}
