**Solution:**

First, let's determine how many reports Vince can staple in one hour.

- **Total time from 8:0 AM to 11:00 PM:** 5 hours.
- **Number of 15-minute intervals in 5 hours:** 
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times 600 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3000 \text{ minutes}
  \]
  \[
  3000 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 200 \text{ intervals}
  \]
- **Total reports in 5 hours:** 
  \[
  220 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 6600 \text{ reports}
  \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]
