**Solution:**

To determine how much Shiela will pay each month, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150/\text{phone} = \$750
   \]

2. **Determine the total interest to be charged:**
   
   Shiela is charged **2% interest** per unit. Since there are 5 units (cell phones), the total interest is:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = 5 \times 2\% \times \$750 = 0.10 \times \$755 = \$75.50
   \]
   
   (Note: The interest is calculated on the total amount, not on each phone individually.)

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Total Interest} = \$755 + \$75.50 = \$830.50
   \]

4. **Determine the monthly payment:**
   
   Shiela will pay the total amount over 3 months:
   
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\$830.50}{3} = \$276.83
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$276.83}
\]
