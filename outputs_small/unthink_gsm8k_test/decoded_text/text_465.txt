Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many students Miss Maria has.

1. **Total Basketball Cards:**
   - Miss Maria has **6 decks** of basketball cards.
   - Each deck contains **25 basketball cards**.

2. **Total Baseball Cards:**
   - She has **5 boxes** of baseball cards.
   - Each box contains **40 baseball cards**.
   - **Total baseball cards = 5 boxes × 40 cards/box = 200 cards.**
