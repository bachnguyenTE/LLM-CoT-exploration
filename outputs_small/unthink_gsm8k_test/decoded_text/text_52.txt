To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Weight to Remove:**  
   Uriah needs to remove **15 pounds** from his book bag.

2. **Weight of Removed Comic Books:**  
   Each comic book weighs **1/4 pound**. If Uriah removes **30 comic books**, the total weight removed from comic books is:  
   \[
   30 \text{ comic books} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound per book} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Remaining Weight to Remove:**  
   Subtract the weight of the removed comic books from the total weight to be removed:  
   \[
   15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of Each Toy:**  
   Each toy weighs **1/2 pound**.

5. **Number of Toys to Remove:**  
   To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining **7.5 pounds**, divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:  
   \[
   \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} = 15 \text{ toys}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys.
