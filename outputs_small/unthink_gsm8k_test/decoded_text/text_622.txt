Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

1. **Total Gum in the Pack:**
   - Jim has a **20-piece** pack of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing Pattern:**
   - **Every 2 hours at school:** Jim chews 1 piece of gum.
   - **School day duration:** 8 hours.
   - **Chewing Time Calculation:**
     - Total time at school: 8 hours.
     - Number of 2-hour intervals in 8 hours: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) intervals.
     - Pieces of gum chewed during school: \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) pieces.

3. **Additional Gum Chewing:**
   - **On the way home:** 1 piece.
   - **After dinner:** 1 stick.
   - **Total additional gum:** \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) pieces.

4. **Total Gum Chewed During the Day:**
   - Gum chewed during school: 4 pieces.
   - Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces.
   - **Total gum chewed:** \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces.

5. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister:**
   - Total gum in the pack: 20 pieces.
   - Gum chewed: 6 pieces.
   - **Gum remaining:** \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces.

6. **Giving Half to Sister:**
   - **Amount given to sister:** \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.
   - **Gum remaining after giving to sister:** \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
