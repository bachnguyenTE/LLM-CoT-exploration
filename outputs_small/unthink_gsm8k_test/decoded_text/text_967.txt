**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Nani's Age:**
   - Nani is **8 years old**.

2. **Brother's Age:**
   - The brother is **twice Nani's age**.
   - **Brother's age = 2 × Nani's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old**.

3. **Sister's Age:**
   - The sister is **25% younger than Nani**.
   - To find 25% of Nani's age: \( 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \) years.
   - **Sister's age = Nani's age - 25% of Nani's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years old**.

4. **Total Age of the Family:**
   - **Nani + Brother + Sister = 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 years old**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
