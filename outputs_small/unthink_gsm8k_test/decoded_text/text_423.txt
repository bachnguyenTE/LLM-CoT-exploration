Q: Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Tattered Jeans:** \$28
- **Jogger Jeans:** \$6 less than tattered jeans
- **Total Savings:** \$6
- **Savings Distribution:**
  - Jogger Jeans: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of total savings
  - Tattered Jeans: Remaining \( \frac{2}{3} \) of total savings

**Let’s denote:**
- **Original Cost of Tattered Jeans:** \( T \)
- **Original Cost of Jogger Jeans:** \( J \)

**Step 1: Express Jogger Jeans in Terms of Tattered Jeans**
\[
J = T - 6
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Savings from Each Type of Jeans**
- **Savings from Tattered Jeans:** \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = \$4 \)
- **Savings from Jogger Jeans:** \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = \$2 \)

**Step 3: Relate Savings to Original Prices**
- **Savings from Tattered Jeans:** \$4 = \( T - 28 \) (since he bought both jeans)
- **Savings from Jogger Jeans:** \$2 = \( J - 28 \)

**Step 4: Solve for \( T \)**
\[
T - 28 = 4 \\
T = 4 + 28 \\
T = 32
\]

**Step 5: Find \( J \)**
\[
J = T - 6 \\
J = 32 - 6 \\
J = 26
\]

**Step 6: Determine the Difference in Original Prices**
\[
T - J = 32 - 26 = 6
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
