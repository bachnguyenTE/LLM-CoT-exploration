**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Floor:**
   - Bill starts on the 3rd floor.

2. **Elevator Movement:**
   - Bill rides the elevator **up** to a floor that is **equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6**.

3. **Calculating the Target Floor:**
   - Let \( F \) be the starting floor.
   - The target floor is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Target Floor} = 4 \times F + 6
     \]
   - Plugging in the starting floor:
     \[
     \text{Target Floor} = 4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Final Floor:**
   - Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides up to the 18th floor.

**Answer:**  
Bill is now on the \(\boxed{18}\)th floor.
