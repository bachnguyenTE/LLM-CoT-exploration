Q: A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit. One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits. One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?

To determine the total price of a crate of fresh fruit, we'll calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum them up.

**Given:**
- **Banana:** \$2.00 each
- **Apple:** \$0.50 each
- **Orange:** \$6.00 each (since it's three times the cost of a banana)

**Composition of the crate:**
- **Bananas:** 5 pieces
- **Apples:** 12 pieces
- **Oranges:** 7 pieces

**Calculations:**

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   \[
   5 \text{ bananas} \times \$2.00/\text{banana} = \$10.00
   \]

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   \[
   12 \text{ apples} \times \$0.50/\text{apple} = \$6.00
   \]

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   \[
   7 \text{ oranges} \times \$6.00/\text{orange} = \$42.00
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   \[
   \$10.00 + \$6.00 + \$42.00 = \$58.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$58.00}
\]
