To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Students:** 20

2. **Contemporary Dance:**
   - **Percentage:** 20%
   - **Number of Students:** \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) students

3. **Remaining Students After Contemporary Dance:**
   - **Total Remaining:** \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students

4. **Jazz Dance:**
   - **Percentage of Remaining Students:** 25%
   - **Number of Students:** \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) students

5. **Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - **Remaining Students After Jazz:** \( 16 - 4 = 2 \) students
   - **Percentage of Total Students:** \( \frac{2}{20} \times 100 = 10\% \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{10\%}\)
