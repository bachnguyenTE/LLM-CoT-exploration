**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Amount Received from the First Bank:**
   - The first bank provided Mr. Josue with **\$4,0000**.

2. **Amount Received from the Second Bank:**
   - The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank.
   - **Amount from the second bank** = 2 × **\$4,000** = **\$8,000**.

3. **Total Amount Received:**
   - **Total** = **\$4,000** + **\$8,000** = **\$12,000**.

4. **Initial Capital:**
   - Mr. Josue initially had **\$5,000** in capital.

5. **Total Capital Now:**
   - **Total Capital** = **\$5,000** + **\$12,000** = **\$17,000**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$17,\!000}
\]
