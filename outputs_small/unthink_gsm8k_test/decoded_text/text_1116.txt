To determine the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the 20% increase:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Add the increase to the original number of students:**
   \[
   55 + 10 = 65
   \]

**Answer:** This year, there are **65** students enrolled in the calligraphy class.
