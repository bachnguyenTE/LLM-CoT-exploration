**Solution:**

To determine how many recipes John learns, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total class time per week:**
   
   The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time.
   
   \[
   \text{Total class time per week} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total class time over 6 weeks:**
   
   Multiply the weekly class time by the number of weeks.
   
   \[
   \text{Total class time} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of recipes learned:**
   
   John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of recipes} = \frac{48}{1.5} = 32
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
