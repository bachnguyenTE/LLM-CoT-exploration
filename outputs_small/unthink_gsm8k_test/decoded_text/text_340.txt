Q: Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to his juggling act each week.  After the end of the fourth week the talent show begins, but when Josh walks on stage he slips and drops three of his balls.  2 of them are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage, but one gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.  With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many balls?

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many balls Josh has left after the incident.

1. **Initial Practice:**
   - Josh starts with **3 balls**.

2. **Weekly Addition:**
   - Josh adds **1 ball** to his juggling act each week.
   - **After 1 week:** 3 + 1 = **4 balls**
   - **After 2 weeks:** 4 +1 = **5 balls**
   - **After 3 weeks:** 5 +1 = **6 balls**
   - **After 4 weeks:** 6 +1 = **7 balls**

3. **Incident on Stage:**
   - After the end of the **4th week**, the talent show begins.
   - **Josh slips and drops 3 balls.**
     - **2 balls** are caught by people and roll off the stage.
     - **1 ball** gets lost completely due to the dark auditorium.
   - **Total balls lost:** 2 + 1 = **3 balls**

4. **Final Count:**
   - Josh started with **7 balls** after the 4th week.
   - He lost **3 balls**.
   - **Final number of balls:** 7 - 3 = **4 balls**

**Answer:** \boxed{4}
