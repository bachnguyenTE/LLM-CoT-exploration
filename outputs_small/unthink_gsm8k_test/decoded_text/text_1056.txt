Q: Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  How many loads of laundry does he do in a year?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of sheets per week:**
   - **Twin beds:** 4 beds × 2 sheets = 8 sheets
   - **King bed:** 1 bed × 2 sheets = 2 sheets
   - **Total sheets per week:** 8 + 2 = 10 sheets

2. **Calculate the number of weeks in a year:**
   - 1 year = 52 weeks

3. **Find the total number of sheets per year:**
   - Total sheets = 10 sheets/week × 52 weeks = 520 sheets

4. **Determine the number of laundry loads:**
   - **Twin sets:** 520 sheets ÷ 2 sheets per load = 260 loads
   - **King set:** 2 sheets ÷ 2 sheets per load = 1 load
   - **Total loads:** 260 + 1 = 261 loads

**Final Answer:** \boxed{261}
