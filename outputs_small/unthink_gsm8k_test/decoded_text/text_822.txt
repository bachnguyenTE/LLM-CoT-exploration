**Solution:**

John completes **30 cycles** of work each day. Each cycle consists of **5 different tasks**, and each task is paid **\$1.20**.

1. **Calculate the total earnings per day:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per day} = \text{Number of cycles} \times \text{Number of tasks per cycle} \times \text{Payment per task}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per day} = 30 \times 5 \times 1.20 = 180 \times 1.20 = 216
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings for a full 7-day week:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for 7 days} = \text{Daily earnings} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for 7 days} = 216 \times 7 = 126
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{126}
\]
