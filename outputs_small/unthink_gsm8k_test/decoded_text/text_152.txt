**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Determine the total cost of the cookies:**
   \[
   60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.60
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from the amount paid:**
   \[
   \$10.00 - \$6.60 = \$3.40
   \]

**Answer:** Carl receives **\$3.40** in change.
