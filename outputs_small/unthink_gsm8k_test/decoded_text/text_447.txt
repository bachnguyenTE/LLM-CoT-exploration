   - Joey scores **26 points**.
   - **Total Points for Joey:** \( 214 + 26 = 240 \) points.

3. **Marcy's Points Before Her Turn:**
   - Marcy starts with **225 points**.

4. **Marcy's Score After Her Turn:**
   - Marcy scores **10 points**.
   - **Total Points for Marcy:** \( 225 +10 = 235 \) points.

5. **Difference in Points:**
