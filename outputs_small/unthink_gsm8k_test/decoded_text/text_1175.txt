Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of goals scored in the soccer match.

### **First Half:**
- **Team A:** Scores **4 goals**.
- **Team B:** Scores **2 goals fewer** than Team A. 
  - **Team B's goals in the first half:** \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) goals.

### **Second Half:**
- **Team A:** Scores **1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B** in the second half.
- **Team B:** Scores **4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half**.
  - **Team B's goals in the first half:** \( 2 \) goals.
  - **Team B's goals in the second half:** \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) goals.
  - **Team A's goals in the second half:** \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) goals.

### **Total Goals in the Match:**
- **Team A's total goals:** \( 4 \) (first half) \( + 2 \) (second half) \( = 6 \) goals.
- **Team B's total goals:** \( 2 \) (first half) \( + 8 \) (second half) \( = 10 \) goals.
- **Total goals in the match:** \( 6 + 10 = 16 \) goals.

\[
\boxed{16}
