Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
- Charlie has **12 friends** on Facebook.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
- Then, Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has \( 4D \) friends.

**Step 1: Find the number of friends Dorothy has.**

We know that Charlie has 12 friends:
\[
3D = 12
\]
To find \( D \), divide both sides by 3:
\[
D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

**Step 2: Find the number of friends James has.**

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James's friends:
\[
4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
