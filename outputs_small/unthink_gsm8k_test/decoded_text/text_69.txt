Let's determine how much money Bailey started with.

**Step 1: Calculate the total allowance received over 8 weeks.**

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of \$5 for 8 weeks:
\[
\text{Total Allowance} = 5 \times 8 = \$40
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of money after receiving the allowance.**

At the end of 8 weeks, the total amount of money is \$100:
\[
\text{Total Money} = \$100
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the total allowance from the total money to find the initial amount.**

\[
\text{Initial Amount} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Allowance} = 100 - 40 = \$60
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
