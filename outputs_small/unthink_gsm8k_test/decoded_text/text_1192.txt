**Solution:**

To determine how much Jen will receive in April, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**
   - Jen works **7.5 hours a day**.
   - She works **6 days a week**.
   - **Total hours per week:** \( 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \).
   - There are **4 weeks** in April.
   - **Total hours for April:** \( 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Calculate Hourly Wages:**
   - Jen's **hourly rate** is **\$1.5**.
   - **Total wages from hours worked:** \( 180 \text{ hours} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$270 \).

3. **Add Additional Compensation:**
   - Jen receives an **additional \$10** for complete attendance.
   - **Total compensation:** \( \$270 + \$10 = \$281 \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$281}
\]
