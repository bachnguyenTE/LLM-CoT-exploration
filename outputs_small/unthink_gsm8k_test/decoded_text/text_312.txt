**Solution:**

We are given the following relationships:

1. **Trent is 5 years older than Jane.**
2. **Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.**
3. **Quinn is 30 years old.**

Let's break this down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine Jane's Age**

Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.

\[
\text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
\]

**Step 2: Determine Trent's Age**

Trent is 5 years older than Jane. We already found Jane's age to be 27, so we add 5 to find Trent's age.

\[
\text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old.
