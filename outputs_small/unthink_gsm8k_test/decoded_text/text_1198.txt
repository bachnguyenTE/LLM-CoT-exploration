Q: To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak on his first day. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.

To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, let's break down the information step by step.

**First Day:**
- **White Oak Trees:** 20
- **Lodgepole Pine Trees:** Twice as many as White Oak trees, so \(2 \times 20 = 40\)

**Total Trees on the First Day:**
\[
20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}
\]

**Second Day:**
- **White Oak Trees:** 10 more than the first day, so \(20 + 10 = 30\)
- **Lodgepole Pine Trees:** 1/4 more than the first day. First, calculate 1/4 of 40:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10.25
\]
Then add this to the original 40:
\[
40 + 10.25 = 54.25
\]

**Total Trees on the Second Day:**
\[
33 \text{ (White Oak)} + 54.25 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 87.25 \text{ trees}
\]

**Total Trees Over Two Days:**
\[
60 \text{ (First Day)} + 87.25 \text{ (Second Day)} = 147.25 \text{ trees}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{147.25}
\]
