Q: Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. He eventually notices that each level of a sandcastle will have half the square footage as the level below it. If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square footage of a level?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Luke is building a sandcastle with 4 levels.
   - Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.
   - The top level (first level) has **16 square feet**.
   - We need to find the **average square footage** of all the levels.

2. **Determining the Square Footage of Each Level:**
   
   - **Top Level (Level 1):** 16 square feet.
   - **Second Level (Level 2):** Half of Level 1.
     \[
     \text{Level 2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet}
     \]
   - **Third Level (Level 3):** Half of Level 2.
     \[
     \text{Level 3} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet}
     \]
   - **Fourth Level (Level 4):** Half of Level 3.
     \[
     \text{Level 4} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Total Square Footage:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Finding the Average Square Footage per Level:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of Levels}} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7.5}
\]
