**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Jessa is 20 years old.
   - Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.
   - Mary is 2 years younger than Joan.

2. **Find:**
   - The sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**

   - **Jessen's Age:**
     \[
     \text{Jessen} = 20 \text{ years}
     \]

   - **Joan's Age:**
     \[
     \text{Joan} = \text{Jessen} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
     \]

   - **Mary's Age:**
     \[
     \text{Mary} = \text{Joan} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Mary} + \text{Joan} + \text{Jessen} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68 \text{ years}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
