Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many points Jojo scored.

1. **Total Points Scored by All Students:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 251 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **Naomi's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Naomi} = 68 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Yuri's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Yuri} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Naomi} + 10 = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Brianna's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Brianna} = \text{Naomi} + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 \text{ points}
   \]

5. **Calculate Jojo's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Jojo} = \text{Total} - (\text{Naomi} + \text{Yuri} + \text{Brianna}) = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54 \text{ points}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{54}
\]
