**Solution:**

Harry slept for 9 hours last night.

James slept **\(\frac{2}{3}\)** of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, multiply Harry's sleep duration by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
\text{James's sleep} = 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, subtract James's sleep duration from Harry's:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
