**Solution:**

To determine the total time Carrie will be caroling, we need to calculate the time spent on each carole and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the time for "Deck the Halls":**
   - **Number of performances:** 2
   - **Duration per performance:** 150 seconds
   - **Total time for "Deck the Halls":** \(2 \times 150 = 300\) seconds

2. **Calculate the time for "Jingle Bells":**
   - **Number of performances:** 1
   - **Duration per performance:** 240 seconds
   - **Total time for "Jingle Bells":** \(1 \times 240 = 240\) seconds

3. **Calculate the total carol time:**
   - **Total time:** \(300 + 240 = 540\) seconds

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{540\ \text{seconds}}
\]
