Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Number of novels written last year: 9
   - This number is **3/4** of the number of novels written this year.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of novels written this year.
   According to the problem:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x = 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
   \[
   x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Regina has written **12** novels this year.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
