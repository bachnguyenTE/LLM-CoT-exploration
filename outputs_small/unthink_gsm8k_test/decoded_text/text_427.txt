Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cards Kenny started with.

1. **Cost of the Amusement Park Ticket:**
   - The ticket costs **\$100**.

2. **Selling Price per Card:**
   - Kenny sells each card for **\$1.50**.

3. **Spending Cash:**
   - He has **\$50** in spending cash.

4. **Cards Kept for the Amusement Park:**
   - He keeps **1/3** of the cards he sells.

5. **Total Amount Kenny Has:**
   - Spending cash: **\$50**
   - Amount from selling cards: Let's denote the number of cards he sells as \( x \). Therefore, the total money from selling cards is \( 1.50x \).

6. **Total Money Kenny Has Before Going to the Park:**
   - Spending cash: **\$55**
   - Money from selling cards: \( 1.50x \)
   - Total: \( 55 + 1.50x \)

7. **Amount Kenny Needs to Pay for the Ticket:**
   - The ticket costs **\$100**, so he needs **\$100**.

8. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total money he has after selling the cards should be equal to the amount needed for the ticket.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     55 + 1.50x = 100
     \]

9. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Subtract **\$55** from both sides:
     \[
     1.50x = 100 - 55
     \]
     \[
     1.50x = 45
     \]
   - Divide both sides by **1.50**:
     \[
     x = \frac{45}{1.50} = 30
     \]
   - So, Kenny sells **30 cards**.

10. **Total Number of Cards Kenny Started With:**
    - He keeps **1/3** of the cards he sells.
    - Let \( y \) be the total number of cards he started with.
    - He sells **30 cards**, so:
      \[
      \frac{1}{3}y = 30
      \]
    - Multiply both sides by **3**:
      \[
      y = 30 \times 3 = 90
      \]

**Final Answer:**
Kenny started with **90 cards**.
