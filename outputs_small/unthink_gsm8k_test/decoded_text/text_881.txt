**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   
   It is given that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. To find her current age, we subtract 10 years from 18:
   
   \[
   \text{Current Age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be thrice her current age:**
   
   Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age. At that time:
   
   \[
   \text{ Melanie's age} = 3 \times \text{Current Age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]
   
   The number of years from now to reach 24 years old is:
   
   \[
   x = 24 - 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
