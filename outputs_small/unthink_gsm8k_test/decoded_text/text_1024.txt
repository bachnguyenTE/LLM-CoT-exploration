**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total earnings from cookies:**
   \[
   80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes:**
   \[
   60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   \$80 + \$244 = \$328
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount given to her sisters:**
   \[
   2 \text{ sisters} \times \$10/\text{sister} = \$20
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining money after giving to her sisters:**
   \[
   \$328 - \$20 = \$300
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$330}
\]
