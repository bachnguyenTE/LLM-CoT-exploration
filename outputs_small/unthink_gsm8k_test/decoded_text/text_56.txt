Q: Peter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?

**Solution:**

Peter buys a movie ticket and popcorn each time he goes to the movies. Each ticket costs \$7, and each popcorn costs \$7. He has a total of \$42 for the week.

Let's denote:
- \( t \) = number of times Peter goes to the movies.

The total cost for \( t \) visits is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = (\text{Cost of Ticket} + \text{Cost of Popcorn}) \times t = (7 + 7) \times t = 14t
\]

We know that Peter has \$42, so:
\[
14t = 42
\]

Solving for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{42}{14} = 3
\]

**Answer:** Peter can go to the movies **3 times** this week.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
