**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Sloane counts **100 customers**.

2. **Second Day:**
   - She counts **50 more customers** than the first day.
   - **Total customers on the second day:** \( 100 + 55 = 155 \) customers.

3. **Third Day:**
   - The **total number of customers by the third day** is **500**.
   - To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total from the first two days from the overall total.
   - **Total customers on the third day:** \( 500 - (100 + 155) = 500 - 255 = 445 \) customers.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{445}
\]
