Q: Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   
   - Ruiz makes **120 pounds** of chocolates in **2 hours**.
   - **Rate of Ruiz** = \( \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \).

2. **Calculate Marissa's production rate:**
   
   - Marissa makes **\( \frac{3}{4} \) times** as many pounds as Ruiz in **1 hour**.
   - **Marissa's rate** = \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \).

3. **Determine the total production for 12 hours:**
   
   - **Total time** = **12 hours**.
   - **Total production by Ruiz** = \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - **Total production by Marissa** = \( 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Calculate the combined total production:**
   
   - **Total production together** = \( 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1260}
