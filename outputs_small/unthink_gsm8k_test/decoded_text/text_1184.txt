**Solution:**

To determine the cost of Ali's order of coal, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of units:**
   - Total coal required: 850 kilograms
   - Each unit (bag) weighs: 50 kilograms
   - Number of units = Total weight / Weight per unit
   - Number of units = 850 kg / 50 kg/unit = 15.5 units

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost per unit: \$18
   - Total cost = Number of units × Cost per unit
   - Total cost = 15.5 units × \$18/unit = \$279

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$279}
\]
