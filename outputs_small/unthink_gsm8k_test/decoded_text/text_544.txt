Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Jeff and Brad are trying to divide \$100 between them. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. How much does Jeff get in dollars?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the amount Brad gets.
   - Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be represented as \( 4B \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total amount they are dividing is \$100.
   - Therefore, \( B + 4B = 100 \).

3. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - \( B + 4B = 5B \).
   - So, \( 5B = 100 \).

4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     B = \frac{100}{5} = 20
     \]
   - Brad gets \$20.

5. **Find Jeff's Amount:**
   - Jeff gets \( 4B \):
     \[
     4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - Jeff gets \$80.

**Final Answer:**
Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars.
