Q: John brings his dog to the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of his total bill. If he brought $125 with him, how much does he leave with?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the Vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs \$20.
   - John brings 2 vaccines.
   - **Total cost for vaccines:** \( 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \).

2. **Cost of the Heartworm Check:**
   - The heartworm check is **60%** of John's total bill.
   - Let’s denote the total bill as \( T \).
   - **Heartworm cost:** \( 0.60 \times T \).

3. **Total Bill:**
   - The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - **Total bill:** \( \$40 + 0.60 \times T \).

4. **Amount John Has:**
   - John brought **\$125** with him.

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Since the total bill equals the amount John has:
     \[
     \$40 + 0.60 \times T = \$125
     \]
   - However, this setup seems a bit confusing because the heartworm check is a percentage of the total bill, not a fixed amount. Let's re-examine the problem.

6. **Correct Interpretation:**
   - The heartworm check is **60%** of **his total bill**, which includes both the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   - Let’s denote the total bill as \( T \).
   - **Heartworm cost:** \( 0.60 \times T \).
   - **Total cost for vaccines:** \$40.
   - **Total bill:** \( \$40 + 0.60 \times T = T \).

7. **Solving for \( T \):**
   \[
   \$40 + 0.60T = T
   \]
   \[
   \$40 = T - 0.60T
   \]
   \[
   \$40 = 0.40T
   \]
   \[
   T = \frac{\$40}{0.40} = \$100
   \]

8. **Amount Left:**
   - John brought **\$125** with him.
   - **Amount left:** \( \$125 - \$100 = \$25 \).

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\$25}
