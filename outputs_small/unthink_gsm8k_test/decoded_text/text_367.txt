Q: 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of customers kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for **refusing to wear masks**.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 4x - 5 \). This equation might seem confusing, but let's proceed carefully.

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - **Shoplifters (S):** The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is **four times that many minus 5**. So,
     \[
     S = 4x - 5
     \]
   - **Physical Violence (P):** Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So,
     \[
     P = 3S = 3(4x - 5)
     \]
   - **Total Kicked Out:** The total number of people kicked out is 50. This includes those kicked out for other reasons (\( O \)). So,
     \[
     x + S + P + O = 50
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expressions:**
   - Substitute \( S \) and \( P \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + O = 50
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 + O = 50
     \]
     \[
     17x - 20 + O = 50
     \]
     \[
     17x + O = 72
     \]
     \[
     O = 72 - 17x
     \]

4. **Determine the Value of \( x \):**
   - From the initial equation \( x = 4x - 5 \):
     \[
     x = 4x - 5
     \]
     \[
     -3x = -5
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - However, \( x \) represents the number of customers, which should be a whole number. This suggests there might be an error in interpreting the problem.

5. **Re-examining the Problem:**
   - The initial equation \( x = 4x - 5 \) seems problematic because it leads to a fractional value for \( x \). This indicates that there might be a misinterpretation of the problem statement.

6. **Alternative Interpretation:**
   - Let's assume the problem means:
     - Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (\( S \)) is **four times that many minus 5**.
     - Number of customers kicked out for physical violence (\( P \)) is **three times the number of shoplifters**.
   - The total number of customers kicked out is 50, including those for other reasons (\( O \)).

7. **Correct Equations:**
   - \( S = 4x - 5 \)
   - \( P = 3S = 3(4x - 5) \)
   - Total: \( x + S + P + O = 50 \)

8. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( S \) and \( P \):
     \[
     x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + O = 50
     \]
     \[
     x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 + O = 50
     \]
     \[
     17x - 20 + O = 50
     \]
     \[
     17x + O = 72
     \]
     \[
     O = 72 - 17x
     \]

9. **Determine \( x \):**
   - Since \( x \) must be a positive integer, let's find a value of \( x \) that makes \( O \) also a positive integer.
   - Let's try \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     O = 72 - 17(4) = 72 - 68 = 4
     \]
   - Check if \( x = 4 \) satisfies the initial condition:
     \[
     S = 4(4) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
     \]
     \[
     P = 3(11) = 3
     \]
     \[
