Q: Bob wants to dig a hole 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, how long will it take him to dig the hole?

**Solution:**

To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to calculate the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes him to shovel one cubic foot of earth.

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Hole:**
   
   The hole is a rectangular prism with the following dimensions:
   
   - Length (\( l \)) = 6 feet
   - Width (\( w \)) = 4 feet
   - Depth (\( d \)) = 3 feet

   The volume (\( V \)) of a rectangular prism is given by:
   
   \[
   V = l \times w \times d
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   
   \[
   V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \,00 \,00 \,00 \,00 \,00 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft}
   \]
   
   \[
   V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   
   It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time (\( T \)) is:
   
   \[
   T = V \times \text{Time per cubic foot}
   \]
   
   \[
   T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot}
   \]
   
   \[
   T = 216 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

3. **Convert Seconds to Minutes (Optional):**
   
   If needed, convert seconds to minutes:
   
   \[
   \text{Minutes} = \frac{216}{60} \approx 3.6 \, \text{minutes}
   \]
   
   However, since the question asks for the time in seconds, we'll keep it as 216 seconds.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{216 \, \text{seconds}}
\]
