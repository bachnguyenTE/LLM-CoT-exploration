**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Toys:**
   - Sophie has a total of **62 toys** for her nephew.

2. **Known Toys:**
   - **Building Blocks:** 31 blocks
   - **Stuffed Animals:** 8 stuffed animals
   - **Stacking Rings:** 9 multicolored rings

3. **Calculate the Total of Known Toys:**
   \[
   31 \text{ (blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (rings)} = 48 \text{ toys}
   \]

4. **Determine the Number of Bouncy Balls:**
   - Total toys = Known toys + Bouncy balls
   \[
   62 = 48 + \text{Bouncy balls}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bouncy balls} = 62 - 48 = 14
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
