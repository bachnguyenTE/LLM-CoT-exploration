Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Ralph has a record store where people can trade their own records for new ones. The exchange rate is 2 old records for 1 new one. Five people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records in total. We need to find out how many old records the five people brought in.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Exchange Rate:**
   - For every 2 old records, you can exchange them for 1 new record.

2. **Determine the Number of Exchanges Needed:**
   - Total new records obtained: 7
   - Since each exchange gives 1 new record for 2 old records, the number of exchanges needed is equal to the number of new records.
   - Number of exchanges = 7

3. **Calculate the Total Old Records Needed:**
   - Each exchange requires 2 old records.
   - Total old records needed = Number of exchanges × 2
   - Total old records needed = 7 × 2 = 14

**Final Answer:**
The five people brought in \(\boxed{14}\) old records.
