**Solution:**

Jade has taken a total of **210 photos**. She uploads **7 photos** in each batch and makes **6 batches** each day. To find out how many days she needs to upload all her photos, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of photos uploaded per day:**
   
   \[
   7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of days required:**
   
   \[
   \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5.0 \text{ days}
   \]

Since she can't upload photos in a fraction of a day, she will need **6 days** to upload all her photos.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
