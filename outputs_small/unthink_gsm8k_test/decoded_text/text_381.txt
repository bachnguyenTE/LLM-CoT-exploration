**Solution:**

To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we'll calculate the distance each hiked and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate Cho's distance:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \,0000 \, \text{h} = 112,0000 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Calculate Chloe's distance:**
   \[
   \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Find the difference in distance:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112,000 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 107,000 \, \text{km}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{107,\!000 \text{ kilometers}}
\]
