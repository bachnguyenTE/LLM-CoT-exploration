Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
   - Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins \( G \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     G = S + 30
     \]

2. **Total Number of Coins:**
   - The total number of coins is given as 110. Therefore:
     \[
     G + S = 110
     \]

3. **Substitute \( G \) from the First Equation into the Second Equation:**
   \[
   (S + 30) + S = 110
   \]
   \[
   2S + 30 = 110
   \]

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   \[
   2S = 110 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2S = 80
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

5. **Find \( G \):**
   \[
   G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins.
