Q: Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?

To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we'll break down her tapping into two scenarios: when her arms are raised and when they are not.

1. **When her arms are not raised:**
   - **Right foot tap rate:** 300 taps per minute
   - **Left foot tap rate:** 250 taps per minute
   - **Total taps per minute:** \(300 + 250 = 575\) taps
   - **Time with arms not raised:** 5 minutes
   - **Total taps during this time:** \(575 \times 5 = 2875\) taps

2. **When her arms are raised:**
   - **Tap rate per foot:** 200 taps per minute
   - **Total taps per minute:** \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps
   - **Time with arms raised:** 2 minutes
   - **Total taps during this time:** \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps

3. **Total taps during the entire dance:**
   - **Total taps:** \(2875 + 800 = 3655\) taps

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{3655}\)
