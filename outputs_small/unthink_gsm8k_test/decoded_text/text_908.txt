**Solution:**

Let's determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some to Jamie and Donald.

1. **Total Marbles:** Dean starts with **30 marbles**.

2. **Giving to Jamie:**
   - Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his marbles to Jamie.
   - Number of marbles given to Jamie: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \) marbles.

3. **Giving to Donald:**
   - Dean gives **10 marbles** to Donald.

4. **Total Marbles Given Away:**
   - Marbles given to Jamie: 6 marbles
   - Marbles given to Donald: 10 marbles
   - **Total given away:** \( 6 + 10 = 16 \) marbles

5. **Marbles Left for Dean:**
   - Total marbles initially: 30
   - Marbles given away: 16
   - **Marbles left:** \( 30 - 16 = 24 \) marbles

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{24}\)
