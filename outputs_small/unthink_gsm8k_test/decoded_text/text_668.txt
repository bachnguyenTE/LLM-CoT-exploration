To determine how many employees oversee the company, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of employees in the company:**  
   \( 50 \)

2. **Percentage of employees who are management:**  
   \( 20\% \) of \( 50 \) employees.

   \[
   20\% \times 55 = 0.20 \times 55 = 11 \text{ management employees}
   \]

3. **Percentage of management employees who oversee the company:**  
   \( 30\% \) of the management employees.

   \[
   30\% \times 11 = 0.33 \text{ (approximately)} \text{ employees}
   \]

   However, since the number of employees must be a whole number, we'll consider the exact calculation.

4. **Exact calculation for the number of employees who oversee the company:**

   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 11 = 0.33 \times 11 = 3.63
   \]

   Since we can't have a fraction of an employee, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

   \[
   \text{Rounded to } 4 \text{ employees}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
