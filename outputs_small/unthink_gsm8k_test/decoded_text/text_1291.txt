**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pens Timothy has:**
   
   - It is given that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
   - George has **18 pens**.
   - Therefore, Timothy has:
     \[
     3 \times 18 = 54 \text{ pens}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of pens Sarah has:**
   
   - It is given that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
   - Timothy has **54 pens**.
   - Therefore, Sarah has:
     \[
     \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ pens}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{27}
