**Solution:**

We need to determine how many chocolate bars each child will get after distributing the chocolates as per the given conditions.

1. **Total Number of Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   - There are 8 packets.
   - **Total chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 bars/packet = 40 bars.**

2. **Distributing Chocolate Bars:**
   - **Adults:** 4 adults each get 6 chocolate bars.
     - **Total for adults = 4 adults × 6 bars/adult = 24 bars.**
   - **Children:** The remaining chocolate bars will be shared equally among 8 children.
     - **Remaining chocolate bars = 40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars.**
     - **Chocolate per child = 16 bars ÷ 8 children = 2 bars/child.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{2}
