Q: Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it took James to complete the run.

### **Given:**
1. **Jon's Times:**
   - **Swim:** 40 minutes
   - **Bike Ride:** 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - **Run:** 50 minutes

2. **James's Performance:**
   - **Swim:** 10% faster than Jon
   - **Bike Ride:** Takes 5 minutes longer than Jon
   - **Run:** Time to be determined

3. **Jon's Win Margin:** Jon won by 10 minutes.

### **Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time**
\[
\text{Jon's Total Time} = 40\text{min} + 80\text{min} + 50\text{min} = 180\text{min}
\]

### **Step 2: Determine Jon's Speeds**
Let's denote:
- \( S_j \) = Jon's swim speed
- \( B_j \) = Jon's bike speed
- \( R_j \) = Jon's run speed

From the given times:
- **Swim:** \( S_j = \frac{40\text{min}}{40\text{min}} = 1 \) (unitless, as it's a ratio)
- **Bike Ride:** \( B_j = \frac{80\text{min}}{80\text{min}} = 1 \)
- **Run:** \( R_j = \frac{50\text{min}}{50\text{min}} = \frac{11}{1.1} \approx 0.9091 \)

### **Step 3: Calculate James's Times**
1. **Swim:**
   - **10% Faster:** \( S_j' = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 \)
   - **Time:** \( T_j' = \frac{40\text{min}}{0.90} \approx 44.444\text{min} \)

2. **Bike Ride:**
   - **5 minutes Longer:** \( B_j' = 1 + \frac{5}{80} = 1.0625 \)
   - **Time:** \( T_j' = \frac{80\text{min}}{1.0625} \approx 75.24\text{min} \)

3. **Run:**
   - **Time to be Determined:** Let's denote it as \( T_r' \)

### **Step 4: Compare to Jon's Win Margin**
Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.

\[
\text{James's Total Time} = \text{Jon's Total Time} + 10\text{min} = 180\text{min}
\]

\[
\text{James's Total Time} = T_j' + T_b' + T_r' = 44.444\text{min} + 75.24\text{min} + T_r' = 120.684\text{min} + T_r'
\]

\[
120.684 + T_r' = 180\text{min}
\]

\[
T_r' = 180 - 120.684 = 59.316\text{min}
\]

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{59\frac{1}{6}\text{minutes}}
\]
