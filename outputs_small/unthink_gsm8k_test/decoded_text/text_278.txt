**Solution:**

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as Mico's current age.
- \( Ma \) as Marco's current age.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20:
\[
M + Ma = 20
\]

In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will be 10 years older. Therefore, the increase in their combined ages is:
\[
10 + 10 = 20 \text{ years}
\]

Adding this to their current total age:
\[
20 + 20 = 42
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{42}\)
