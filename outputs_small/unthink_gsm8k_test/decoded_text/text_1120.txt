**Solution:**

1. **Determine the one-way distance:**
   
   - **Speed:** 70 mph
   - **Time:** 2 hours
   
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \,000 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \,00 \,0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   
   \[
   \text{Round Trip Distance} = 2 \times 140 \,00 \,0 \,0 \,0 \,0 \, \text{miles} = 288 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of visits per month:**
   
   - **Visits per month:** 2

4. **Calculate total monthly driving distance:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Distance} = 288 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 576 \,00 \,0 \,0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{576,000}
\]
