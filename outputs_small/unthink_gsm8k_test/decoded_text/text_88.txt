Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. How many copies did Harald sell?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
   - Since Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of copies sold by both is 88,000.
   \[
   H + 10H = 88,000
   \]

3. **Combine Like Terms:**
   \[
   12H = 88,000
   \]

4. **Solve for \( H \):**
   \[
   H = \frac{88,000}{12}
   \]
   \[
   H = 7,333.33
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Harald sold **7,333.33 copies** of the record.

\[
\boxed{7,\!333.33}
\]
