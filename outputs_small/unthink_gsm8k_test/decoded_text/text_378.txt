**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Socks Needed:**
   - Lindsay has 50 socks that need washing.

2. **Socks Washed:**
   - She washes 10 pairs of socks.
   - Each pair consists of 2 socks, so 10 pairs = \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks.
   - She also has 15 loose socks.

3. **Total Socks Washed:**
   - Total socks washed = Socks in pairs + Loose socks
   - Total socks washed = \(20 + 15 = 35\) socks.

4. **Socks Missed:**
   - Total socks needed - Total socks washed = \(50 - 35 = 15\) socks.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
