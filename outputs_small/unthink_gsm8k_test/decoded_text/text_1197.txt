**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of \$600.
   - **Cost per bottle of scotch:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - **Number of bottles of cognac:**
     \[
     2 \times 10 \text{ bottles} = 20 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - Cognac costs 50% more per bottle than scotch.
   - **Cost per bottle of scotch:** \$60
   - **Increase in cost for cognac:**
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } \$60 = 0.5 \times 60 = \$33
     \]
   - **Cost per bottle of cognac:**
     \[
     \$60 + \$33 = \$93 \text{ per bottle}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for cognac:**
   - **Total cost for 20 bottles of cognac:**
     \[
     20 \text{ bottles} \times \$93 \text{ per bottle} = \$1,860
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on everything:**
   - **Total cost for scotch:** \$600
   - **Total cost for cognac:** \$1,860
   - **Total expenditure:**
     \[
     \$600 + \$1,860 = \$2,460
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$2,\!460}
\]
