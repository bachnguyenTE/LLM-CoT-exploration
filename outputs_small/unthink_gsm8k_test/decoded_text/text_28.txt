**Solution:**

Henry's bike trip is 60 miles long. He makes two stops:

1. **First Stop:** After 20 miles.
2. **Second Stop:** 15 miles before the end.

**Calculating the Distance to the Second Stop:**

The total trip is 60 miles. If he stops 15 miles before the end, the distance to the second stop is:
\[
60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
\]

**Determining the Distance Between the Two Stops:**

He traveled 20 miles to the first stop and 45 miles to the second stop. The distance between the two stops is:
\[
45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
