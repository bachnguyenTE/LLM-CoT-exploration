Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Beck has initially.**

\[
\text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many apples Boris gives to Beck.**

\[
\text{Apples given by Boris to Beck} = 10
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the new number of apples each has after the transfer.**

- **Boris's new apples:**
\[
100 - 10 = 90
\]

- **Beck's new apples:**
\[
77 + 10 = 87
\]

**Step 4: Find how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
