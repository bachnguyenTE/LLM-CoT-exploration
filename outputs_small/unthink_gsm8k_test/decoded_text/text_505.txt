Q: Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - Each popsicle stick requires a 2 x 4 piece of wood.
   - Frederick can also use 2 x 8 pieces of wood, but they are more expensive.

2. **Calculate the Cost per Stick:**
   - **2 x 4 Wood:**
     - Cost: \$4 for 20 sticks.
     - Cost per stick: \$4 / 20 = \$0.20 per stick.
   - **2 x 8 Wood:**
     - Cost: \$6 for 40 sticks.
     - Cost per stick: \$6 / 40 = \$0.15 per stick.

3. **Determine the Cheapest Option:**
   - The 2 x 8 wood is cheaper per stick (\$0.15) compared to the 2 x 4 wood (\$0.20).

4. **Maximize the Number of Sticks:**
   - With \$24, use as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible.
   - Number of 2 x 8 pieces: \$24 / \$6 = 4 pieces.
   - Total sticks: 4 pieces * 40 sticks = 160 sticks.

**Final Answer:** Frederick can make **160 popsicle sticks**.
