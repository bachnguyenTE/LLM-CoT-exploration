**Solution:**

Heather has a total of **27 cups** of raisins. She wants to divide this equally among three categories: oatmeal cookies, granola, and a snack mix. 

1. **Determine the amount of raisins per category:**
   
   \[
   \text{Raisins per category} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies:**
   
   Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires **\(\frac{3}{4}\)** of a cup of raisins.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
