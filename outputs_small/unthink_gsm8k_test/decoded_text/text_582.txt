**Solution:**

1. **Determine the price of Juan's house:**
   
   - **Herb's house price:** \$76,000
   - **Juan's house is 30% less expensive.**
   
   To find 30% of \$76,000:
   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 23,400
   \]
   
   Subtract this amount from Herb's price to get Juan's price:
   \[
   76,000 - 23,400 = 52,600
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the combined value of both houses:**
   
   \[
   76,000 + 52,600 = 128,600
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{128,\!600}
\]
