To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the required line per dock foot:**
   - The caretaker needs **3 feet of line** for every **1 foot of dock**.
   - So, for **200 feet of dock**, he needs:
     \[
     200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total line needed:**
   - He already has **6 feet of new line**.
   - Therefore, the total line he needs to buy is:
     \[
     660 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of existing line} = 654 \text{ feet of new line}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{654}
\]
