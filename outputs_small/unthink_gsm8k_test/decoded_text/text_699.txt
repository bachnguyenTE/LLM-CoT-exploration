A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

We are given:
- Total space available in the box: 20 pencils
- Number of pencils missing from the box: 4

To find the number of pencils currently in the box, we subtract the missing pencils from the total available space.

\[
\text{Number of pencils in the box} = \text{Total space} - \text{Missing pencils} = 20 - 4 = 16
\]

Since the question asks for the number of **pairs** of pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2.

\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Number of pencils in the box}}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
