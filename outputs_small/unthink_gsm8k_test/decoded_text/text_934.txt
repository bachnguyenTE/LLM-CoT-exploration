To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance each person spat:**
   - **Zoey's total distance:**
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Seeds} \times \text{Distance per Seed} = 40 \times 10\ \text{feet} = 400\ \text{feet}
     \]
   - **Sydney's total distance:**
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Seeds} \times \text{Distance per Seed} = 35 \times 12\ \text{feet} = 420\ \text{feet}
     \]

2. **Find the combined total distance:**
   \[
   \text{Combined Total Distance} = 440\ \text{feet} + 420\ \text{feet} = 866\ \text{feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average total distance:**
   \[
   \text{Average Total Distance} = \frac{\text{Combined Total Distance}}{2} = \frac{866\ \text{feet}}{2} = 433\ \text{feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{433\ \text{feet}}
\]
