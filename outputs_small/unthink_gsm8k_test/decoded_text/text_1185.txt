To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cheese Pizza:** Cut into 12 slices.
- **Pepperoni Pizza:** Cut into 8 slices.
- **Kate's Friends:** 6 friends.
- **Cheese Pizza Consumption:** Each friend eats 6 slices.
- **Pepperoni Pizza Consumption:** Each friend eats 4 slices.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Cheese Pizza Slices Needed**
\[
\text{Total Cheese Slices} = 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Pepperoni Pizza Slices Needed**
\[
\text{Total Pepperoni Slices} = 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 3: Determine How Many Pizzas Are Needed for Each Type**

- **Cheese Pizza:**
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
  \]
  
- **Pepperoni Pizza:**
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
  \]

**Step 4: Sum the Total Pizzas Needed**
\[
3 \text{ (Cheese)} + 3 \text{ (Pepperoni)} = 6 \text{ pizzas}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
