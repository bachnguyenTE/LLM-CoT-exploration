Q: Amy is taking a history test. She correctly answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions, 90% of the true/false questions, and 60% of the long-answer questions. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, and the long answer questions are worth 5 points each.

To determine Amy's total score on the history test, we'll calculate her score for each type of question separately and then sum them up.

**1. Multiple-Choice Questions:**
- **Number of questions:** 10
- **Correct answers:** 80% of 10
- **Score per question:** 1 point
- **Total score:** \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \) points

**2. True/False Questions:**
- **Number of questions:** 20
- **Correct answers:** 90% of 22
- **Score per question:** 1 point
- **Total score:** \( 22 \times 0.90 = 19.8 \) points

**3. Long-Answer Questions:**
- **Number of questions:** 5
- **Correct answers:** 60% of 5
- **Score per question:** 5 points
- **Total score:** \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) points

**Total Score:**
\[
8 \, 19.8, 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + 19.8 + 3 = 30.8 \text{ points}
\]

\[
\boxed{30.8}
\]
