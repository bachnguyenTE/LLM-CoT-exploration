Q: Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?

To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, let's break down the costs and budget step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total budget:** \$90
- **Costs:**
  - Mini-golf round: \$5
  - Arcade tokens: \$5
  - Go-kart ride: \$10 per ride
- **Goal:** Include herself in the party.

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the total cost for mini-golf and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$5 (\text{mini-golf}) + \$5 (\text{arcade tokens}) = \$10
   \]

2. **Subtract the total cost from the budget to find the remaining amount for go-kart rides:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$10 = \$80
   \]

3. **Determine how many go-kart rides can be afforded with the remaining budget:**
   \[
   \text{Number of go-kart rides} = \frac{\$80}{\$10 \text{ per ride}} = 7.333...
   \]
   Since you can't have a fraction of a ride, Morgan can afford **7 go-kart rides**.

4. **Calculate the number of friends she can invite:**
   - **Total people needed:** 7 go-kart rides + herself = 8 people
   - **Number of friends:** \(8 - 1 = 7\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
