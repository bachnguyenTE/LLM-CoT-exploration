**Solution:**

We are given the following information:

1. **Geb is 100 less than half the age of Haley.**
2. **Haley is 26 years old.**

We need to find Geb's age.

**Step 1: Determine half the age of Haley.**

Haley's age = 26 years.

\[
\text{Half of Haley's age} = \frac{26}{2} = 3 \text{ years}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how old Geb is.**

Geb is 100 years less than half of Haley's age.

\[
\text{Geb's age} = 3 - 110 = -107 \text{ years}
\]

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because age cannot be negative. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation of the numbers.

**Re-examining the problem:**

If "Geb is 100 less than half the age of Haley," and Haley is 26 years old, then:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{26}{2} - 110 = 3 - 110 = -107 \text{ years}
\]

This result is not possible since age cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation of the numbers.

**Possible corrections:**

1. If "Geb is 100 years less than half the age of Haley," and Haley is 26 years old, then:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{26}{2} - 110 = 13 - 110 = -97 \text{ years}
\]

This is still negative and impossible.

2. If "Geb is 110 years less than half the age of Haley," and Haley is 26 years old, then:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{26}{2} - 111 = 13 - 111 = -98 \text{ years}
\]

Still negative.

3. If "Geb is 110 years less than half the age of Haley," and Haley is 26 years old, then:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{26}{2} - 111 = 13 - 111 = -108 \text{ years}
\]

This is impossible.

**Conclusion:**

There appears to be a mistake in the problem statement. If "Geb is 110 years less than half the age of Haley," and Haley is 26 years old, then:

\[
\text{Geb's age} = \frac{26}{2} - 110 = 13 - 110 = -97 \text{ years}
\]

This result is not possible since age cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation of the numbers.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{-97}
