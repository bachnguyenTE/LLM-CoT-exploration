To determine the force John needs to push the car, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the car and luggage:**
   \[
   \text{Total Weight} = \text{Car Weight} + \text{Luggage Weight} = 1200\ \text{pounds} + 250\ \text{pounds} = 1450\ \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the force to move the car:**
   \[
   \text{Force} = 1\% \text{ of Total Weight} = 0.01 \times 1450\ \text{pounds} = 14.645\ \text{pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14.645\ \text{ pounds}}
\]
