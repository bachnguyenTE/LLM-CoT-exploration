Q: The population of porcupines in a park is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, how many porcupines will be in the park after a year?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Population of Porcupines:**
   - Given: 50 porcupines.

2. **Number of Female Porcupines:**
   - Fraction of total population that are female: \( \frac{3}{5} \).
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) female porcupines.

3. **Number of Male Porcupines:**
   - Since the total population is 50, and 30 are female:
   - Calculation: \( 50 - 33 = 22 \) male porcupines.

4. **Number of Babies Born Per Month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Calculation: \( 33 \times 4 = 132 \) babies per month.

5. **Number of Babies Born In a Year:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year:
   - Calculation: \( 132 \times 12 = 1,584 \) babies in a year.

6. **Total Number of Porcupines After a Year:**
   - Initial population: 50.
   - New babies: 1,584.
   - Calculation: \( 50 + 1,584 = 1,634 \) porcupines.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1634}
