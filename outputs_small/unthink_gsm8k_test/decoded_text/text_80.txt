To determine how many liters of water were left, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Water Initially:** 24 liters

2. **Water Given to Each Girl:**
   - Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total water.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \) liters per girl.
   - **Total Given to Girls:** \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) liters.

3. **Water Given to the Boy:**
   - The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. **Total Water Distributed:**
   - **Water to Girls:** 8 liters
   - **Water to Boy:** 6 liters
   - **Total Distributed:** \( 8 + 6 = 14 \) liters

5. **Water Left:**
   - **Initial Total:** 24 liters
   - **Subtract Distributed:** 14 liters
   - **Water Left:** \( 24 - 14 = 10 \) liters

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{10}\) liters
