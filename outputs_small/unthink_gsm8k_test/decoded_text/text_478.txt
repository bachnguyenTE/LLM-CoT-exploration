To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of groups and employees per group:**
   - There are **3 groups**.
   - Each group has **200 employees**.

2. **Calculate the total number of employees:**
   \[
   3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tour guides:**
   - Each group is assigned **7 tour guides**.
   - There are **3 groups**, so:
   \[
   3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people on the tour:**
   \[
   600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 661 \text{ people}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{661}\)
