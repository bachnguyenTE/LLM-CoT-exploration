**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

2. **Calculating Sofie's Total Distance:**
   - Sofie walks 10 miles/day.
   - Over 7 days, Sofie walks: \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Relating Sofie's and Brian's Distances:**
   - Sofie's total distance is twice Brian's total distance.
   - Let \(B\) be the total distance Brian walks in 7 days.
   - According to the problem: \(70 = 2B\).

4. **Solving for \(B\):**
   - \(B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}\).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Brian will walk **35 miles** in 7 days.

\boxed{35}
