Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
- The travel time by bus takes **6 days**.
- It takes **half as many days** by car to travel from New Jersey to Rochester.

**Objective:**
- Determine the total number of days Andrew will travel if he goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car.

**Solution:**

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - **One way (New Jersey to Rochester):** 6 days.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes **half as many days** by car.
   - Therefore, the travel time by car is:
     \[
     \text{Car travel time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - **Going to Rochester by bus:** 6 days.
   - **Returning from Rochester by car:** 3 days.
   - **Total travel days:**
     \[
     6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
