To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Ford's weekly roses:** 40
- **First flower shop order:** 20 roses
- **Second flower shop order:** 15 roses
- **Third flower shop order:** 30 roses

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Weekly Supply**
First, find out how many roses Ford supplies to all the flower shops in one week.

\[
\text{Total weekly supply} = 20 + 15 +30 = 65 \text{ roses}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Weekly Shortage**
Next, determine how many roses Ford is **lacking** each week.

\[
\text{Weekly shortage} = \text{Ford's weekly supply} - \text{Total weekly supply} = 40 - 65 = -25
\]

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because Ford is supplying more roses than the total orders. Let's correct this.

**Correct Calculation:**

\[
\text{Total weekly supply} = 40 \text{ roses}
\]
\[
\text{Total weekly orders} = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly shortage} = \text{Total weekly orders} - \text{Ford's weekly supply} = 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses}
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate Monthly Shortage**
Assuming **4 weeks in a month**, calculate the total shortage for the month.

\[
\text{Monthly shortage} = 25 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 100 \text{ roses}
\]

### **Final Answer**
Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month.
