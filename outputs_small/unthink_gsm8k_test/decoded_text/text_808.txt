To determine how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Tea Left After the Party:**
   - **Tea left:** 10 quarts

2. **Tea Consumed by Students:**
   - **Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:**
     \[
     4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - **16 students each drank 2 quarts:**
     \[
     16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
     \]

3. **Total Tea Consumed:**
   \[
   6 \text{ quarts} + 32 \text{ quarts} = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. **Total Tea at the Beginning of the Party:**
   \[
   \text{Total Tea} = \text{Tea Consumed} + \text{Tea Left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tea} = 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

5. **Convert Quarts to Gallons:**
   - **1 gallon = 4 quarts**
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12 \text{ gallons}}
\]
