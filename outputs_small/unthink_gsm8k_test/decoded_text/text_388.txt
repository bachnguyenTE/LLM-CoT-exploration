**Solution:**

James delivers messages to two teachers' classrooms. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson:**  
   James delivers **66 messages**.

2. **Messages to Mr. Yu:**  
   He delivers **1/3** as many messages as to Ms. Thompson.  
   To find this, divide the number of messages to Ms. Thompson by 3:  
   \[
   \frac{66}{3} = 22
   \]

3. **Total Messages Delivered:**  
   Add the messages delivered to both classrooms:  
   \[
   66 + 22 = 88
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
James delivers a total of \(\boxed{88}\) messages.
