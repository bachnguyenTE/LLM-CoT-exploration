**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are **5** phones on a phone plan.
   - The **main phone** costs twice as much as each **additional phone**.
   - The **main phone plan** costs **\$20**.
   - We need to find the total cost of all 5 phones.

2. **Defining Variables:**
   - Let’s denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost of all 5 phones is the sum of the main phone and the four additional phones.
   - Total cost = Main phone + 4 × (cost of each additional phone)
   - Total cost = \( 2x + 4x = 6x \)

4. **Given Information:**
   - The main phone costs **\$20**.
   - Therefore, \( 2x = 20 \)

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - \( 2x = 20 \)
   - \( x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
   - So, each additional phone costs **\$10**.

6. **Calculating the Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = \( 6x = 6 \times 10 = 60 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
