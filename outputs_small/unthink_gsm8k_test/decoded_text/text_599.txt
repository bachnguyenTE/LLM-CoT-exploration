To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we'll calculate the legs contributed by each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs:**  
   - **Number of dogs:** 5  
   - **Legs per dog:** 4  
   - **Total legs from dogs:** \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) legs

2. **Cats:**  
   - **Number of cats:** 2  
   - **Legs per cat:** 4  
   - **Total legs from cats:** \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) legs

3. **Birds:**  
   - **Number of birds:** 10  
   - **Legs per bird:** 2  
   - **Total legs from birds:** \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs

4. **Total legs in the store:**  
   - **Sum of all legs:** \( 20 \) (dogs) + \( 8 \) (cats) + \( 20 \) (birds) = \( 50 \) legs

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{50}
