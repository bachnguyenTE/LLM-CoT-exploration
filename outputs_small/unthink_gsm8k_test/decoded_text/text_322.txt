**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jam's Pencils:**
   - Jam has **3 boxes** of pencils.
   - Each box contains **12 pencils** (since \(3 \times 12 = 36\)).
   - She also has **2 loose pencils**.
   - **Total pencils for Jam:** \(3 \times 12 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38\) pencils.

2. **Meg's Pencils:**
   - Meg has **46 pencils**.

3. **Total Pencils:**
   - **Total pencils for Jam and Meg:** \(38 + 46 = 44\) pencils.

4. **Number of Boxes Needed:**
   - Each box can hold **12 pencils**.
   - **Number of boxes required:** 
     \[
     \frac{44 \text{ pencils}}{12 \text{ pencils/box}} = 3.666...
     \]
   - Since you can't have a fraction of a box, you need to round up to the next whole number.
   - **Total boxes needed:** \(4\) boxes.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{4}\)
