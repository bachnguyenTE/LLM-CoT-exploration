To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues over time.

**Costs:**
- **Planting Cost:** \$90 (one-time cost)
- **Watering and Feeding Cost:** \$3 per year

**Revenues:**
- **Growth:** 7 lemons per year
- **Selling Price:** \$1.5 per lemon

**Break-Even Analysis:**
1. **Total Cost (TC):** Initial planting cost plus annual watering and feeding costs.
   \[
   TC = 90 + 3 \times \text{Years}
   \]
2. **Total Revenue (TR):** Annual growth multiplied by selling price.
   \[
   TR = 7 \times 1.5 \times \text{Years} = 10.5 \times \text{Years}
   \]
3. **Profit (P):** Total Revenue minus Total Cost.
   \[
   P = TR - TC = 10.5 \times \text{Years} - (90 + 3 \times \text{Years})
   \]
   \[
   P = 7.5 \times \text{Years} - 90
   \]

**When Profit is Zero (Break-Even Point):**
\[
7.5 \times \text{Years} - 90 = 0
\]
\[
7.5 \times \text{Years} = 90
\]
\[
\text{Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

**Conclusion:**
Carlos will start earning money on his lemon tree after **12 years**.

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
