Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of everything James bought.

1. **Suits:**
   - James buys **10 suits**.
   - Each suit costs **\$750**.
   - **Total cost for suits:** \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

2. **Dress Pants:**
   - James buys **10 dress pants**.
   - Each dress pants costs **1/5 of the suit cost**, which is \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - **Total cost for dress pants:** \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

3. **Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys **3 dress shirts per suit**.
   - He buys **10 suits**, so the total number of dress shirts is \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \).
   - Each dress shirt costs **\$60**.
   - **Total cost for dress shirts:** \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Total cost for suits:** \$7500
   - **Total cost for dress pants:** \$1550
   - **Total cost for dress shirts:** \$1800
   - **Adding them all together:** \( 7500 + 1550 + 1800 = 10900 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{10900}\)
