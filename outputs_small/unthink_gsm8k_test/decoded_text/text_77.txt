**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
   - According to the problem, **Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David**. So, Sarah's laundry (\( S \)) can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = 4D
     \]
   - **Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah**. Therefore, Raymond's laundry (\( R \)) is:
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2}S
     \]
   
2. **Given:**
   - Sarah does **400 pounds of laundry** (\( S = 400 \) pounds).

3. **Calculate Sarah's Laundry:**
   \[
   S = 400 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
4. **Calculate David's Laundry:**
   \[
   S = 4D \implies 400 = 4D \implies D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
5. **Calculate Raymond's Laundry:**
   \[
   R = \frac{1}{2}S = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
6. **Find the Difference Between Raymond and David:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{100}
\]
