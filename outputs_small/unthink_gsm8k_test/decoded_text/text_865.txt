Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are **12 red cars**.

2. **Green Cars:**
   - They have **2 fewer green cars** than red cars.
   - **Green cars = Red cars - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 cars.**

3. **Blue Cars:**
   - They have **3 times the number of blue cars** as green cars.
   - **Blue cars = 3 × Green cars = 3 × 10 = 30 cars.**

4. **Total Non-Yellow Cars:**
   - **Red + Green + Blue = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.**

5. **Total Cars in the Rink:**
   - The rink has **75 cars** in total.

6. **Yellow Cars:**
   - **Yellow cars = Total cars - Non-yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23 cars.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
