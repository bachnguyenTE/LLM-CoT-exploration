**Solution:**

To determine the final price after a 20% discount on a laptop priced at \$1000, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left( \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \right)
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount amount from the original price:**
   
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 = 780
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{780}
\]
