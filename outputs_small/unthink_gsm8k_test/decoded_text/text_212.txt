Q: Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

**Solution:**

To determine how long Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park and then divide it by his walking speed.

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Park:**
   
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (length + width)
   \]
   
   Given:
   - Length (\( l \)) = 6 miles
   - Width (\( w \)) = 1.5 miles
   
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the Time Spent Walking:**
   
   Gary's walking speed (\( v \)) = 3 miles per hour.
   
   Time (\( t \)) is calculated by:
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   Simplifying:
   \[
   t = 1 \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} \quad \text{or} \quad 1 \text{ hour and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1 \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}}
\]
