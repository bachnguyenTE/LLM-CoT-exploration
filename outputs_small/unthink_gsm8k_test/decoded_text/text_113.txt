**Solution:**

Ryan plants **2 flowers** every day. After **15 days**, the total number of flowers he plants is:

\[
2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
\]

However, **5 of these flowers** did not grow. Therefore, the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[
30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
