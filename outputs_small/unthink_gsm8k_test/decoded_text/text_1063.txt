**Solution:**

James receives **80 emails** each day. Out of these, **20%** (which is **20/100 = 0.20**) do not require a response, and **78%** (which is **78/100 = 0.78**) do require a response.

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response per day:**
   
   \[
   80 \text{ emails/day} \times 0.78 = 66.24 \text{ emails}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of response emails for a 5-day work week:**
   
   \[
   66.24 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 331.2 \text{ emails}
   \]

Since you can't send a fraction of an email, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{331}
\]
