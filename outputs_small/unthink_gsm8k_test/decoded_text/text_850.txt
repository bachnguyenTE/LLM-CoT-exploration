**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Goats:**
   - **Farm X:** 55 goats
   - **Farm Y:** 45 goats

2. **Goats Sold:**
   - **Farm X:** 10 goats (10 goats sold from Farm X)
   - **Farm Y:** Twice as many as Farm X, so \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats (20 goats sold from Farm Y)

3. **Goats Remaining:**
   - **Farm X:** \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - **Farm Y:** \(45 -20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total Goats Left:**
   - \(45 + 25 = 70\) goats

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{70}\)
