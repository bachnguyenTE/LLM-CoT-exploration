**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Months in a Year:**
   \[
   12 \text{ months}
   \]

2. **First Half of the Year:**
   - **Number of Months:** \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ months} \)
   - **Monthly Charge:** \$140
   - **Total Paid in First Half:**
     \[
     6 \times 144 = \$864
     \]

3. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - **Initial Charge:** \$140
   - **Reduction:** 10% of \$144
   - **Reduction Amount:**
     \[
     0.10 \times 144 = \$15.84
     \]
   - **Charged Amount:**
     \[
     144 - 15.84 = \$128.16
     \]
   - **Total Paid in Second Half:**
     \[
     128.16 \text{ (rounded to two decimal places)}
     \]

4. **Total Amount Paid for the Year:**
   \[
   864 + 128.16 = \$992.16
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{992.16}
\]
