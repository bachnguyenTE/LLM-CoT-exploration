**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Number of **hempers** = 20
   
2. **Relationships:**
   - Dominick saw **half as many robots** as helmets.
   - Dominick saw **half as many helmets** as footballs.

3. **Let’s define variables:**
   - Let \( H \) = Number of Helmets = 20
   - Let \( F \) = Number of Footballs
   - Let \( R \) = Number of Robots

4. **Expressing in terms of Helmets:**
   - **Hearts and Footballs:**
     - \( H = 20 \)
     - \( F = 2 \times H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
   - **Robots:**
     - \( R = \frac{1}{2} \times H = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \)

5. **Total Number of Items:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = H + F + R = 20 + 40 + 10 = 72
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{72}
\]
