Q: Cecilia just bought a new puppy. According to her veterinarian, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of days in the first year:**
   - 1 year = 365 days (including 29 days in February for a leap year).

2. **Calculate the total dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - **Daily feed:** 1 cup
   - **Total for 180 days:** \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \)

3. **Calculate the total number of days remaining in the year after the first 180 days:**
   - \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \)

4. **Calculate the total dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - **Daily feed:** 2 cups
   - **Total for 185 days:** \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \)

5. **Calculate the total dog food needed for the entire first year:**
   - **Total:** \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 554 \text{ cups} \)

6. **Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:**
   - **Cups per bag:** 110 cups
   - **Number of bags:** \( \frac{554 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 5.036 \text{ bags} \)

7. **Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, round up to the next whole number:**
   - **Total bags needed:** 6 bags

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{6}\)
