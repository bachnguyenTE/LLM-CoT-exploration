**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Mark's Weight:**
   - Mark weighs **150 pounds**.

2. **Susan's Weight:**
   - Susan weighs **20 pounds less** than Mark.
   - **Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds**
   - **Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds**

3. **Bob's Weight:**
   - Bob weighs **twice as much** as Susan.
   - **Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight**
   - **Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds = 260 pounds**

4. **Total Weight of All Three Friends:**
   - **Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight**
   - **Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds = 545 pounds**

5. **Average Weight:**
   - **Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends**
   - **Average weight = 545 pounds / 3 = 181.666... pounds**

6. **Rounding:**
   - Since weights are typically expressed in whole numbers, we can round the average to the nearest whole number.
   - **Average weight ≈ 182 pounds**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{182}
