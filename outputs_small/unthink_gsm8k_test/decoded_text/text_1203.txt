Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Mattison's Height:**
   - Mattison is **60 inches** tall.

2. **Height of the Two-Story House:**
   - The house is **7 times** as high as Mattison.
   - **Height of the house** = \( 7 \times 60 \) inches = **420 inches**.

3. **Floor to Ceiling on the First Floor:**
   - The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is **3 times** Mattison's height.
   - **First floor height** = \( 3 \times 60 \) inches = **180 inches**.

4. **Calculating the Height from the Second Floor's Floor to the Roof:**
   - The total height of the house is **420 inches**.
   - Subtract the height of the first floor (180 inches) from the total height:
     \[
     420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is **240 inches**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
