**Solution:**

We are given:
- **Growth rate of Mrs. Jameson's bamboo:** 30 inches per day.
- **Current height of the bamboo:** 20 feet.
- **Desired height:** 600 inches.

**Step 1:** Convert the current height from feet to inches to have consistent units.

\[
20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the additional height needed to reach 600 inches.

\[
600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional 360 inches at a rate of 30 inches per day.

\[
\frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
