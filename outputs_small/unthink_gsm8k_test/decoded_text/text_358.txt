**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total pocket money Marisa receives in 5 days:**
   
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of one lollipop:**
   
   \[
   4 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.25/\text{lollipop} = \$1.00
   \]

3. **Find the amount saved in one day:**
   
   \[
   \$2.50 \text{ (pocket money)} - \$1.00 \text{ (lollipops)} = \$1.50 \text{ saved}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total savings over 5 days:**
   
   \[
   \$1.50/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$7.50
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$7.50}
\]
