Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cards have the letter **D** on them.

1. **Total Cards:** 80

2. **Cards with Letter A:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Remaining Cards After A:**
   \[
   80 - 32 = 56 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards with Letter B:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 56 = 28 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Remaining Cards After B:**
   \[
   56 - 28 = 28 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Cards with Letter C:**
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 28 = \frac{140}{8} = 17.25 \text{ cards}
   \]
   (Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we'll consider this as 17 cards for simplicity.)

7. **Remaining Cards After C:**
   \[
   28 - 17 = 11 \text{ card}
   \]

8. **Cards with Letter D:**
   \[
   11 \text{ cards}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{11}\)
