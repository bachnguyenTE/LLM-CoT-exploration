**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of songs:**
   
   - Each playlist has **300 songs**.
   - John has **20 playlists**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total songs} = 300 \, \text{Playlists} = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total songs} = 300 \times 20 = 6,000 \text{ songs}
   \]

3. **Find the total duration of all songs:**
   
   - Each song is **10 hours long**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total duration} = 6,000 \times 10 = 60,000 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{60,\!000 \text{ hours}}
\]
