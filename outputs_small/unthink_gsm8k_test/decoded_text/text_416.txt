Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of heads: 180
- Total number of bumps: 304
- Camels have **2 humps** each.
- Dromedaries have **1 hump** each.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( c \) = number of camels
- Let \( d \) = number of dromedaries

**Equations based on the given information:**
1. **Heads:** Each animal has 1 head.
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. **Bumps:** Camels have 2 bumps each, dromedaries have 1 bump.
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

**Solving the equations:**

From the first equation:
\[
c = 180 - d
\]

Substitute \( c \) into the second equation:
\[
2(180 - d) + d = 304
\]
\[
360 - 2d + d = 304
\]
\[
360 - d = 304
\]
\[
-d = 304 - 360
\]
\[
-d = -60
\]
\[
d = 60
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
