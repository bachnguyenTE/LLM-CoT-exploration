Q: At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of People:**
   - There are **90** people going to the scavenger hunt.

2. **Group Formation:**
   - The competition requires splitting **90 people into groups**.
   - Each group consists of **9 people**.

3. **Number of Groups:**
   - To form groups of 9, we divide the total number of people by the group size:
     \[
     \text{Number of Groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \text{ groups}
     \]

4. **Seashells Calculation:**
   - **3/5 of the number of groups** bring back **2 seashells each**.
   - First, find **3/5 of the number of groups**:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
     \]
   - Each of these 6 groups brings back **2 seashells**:
     \[
     6 \text{ groups} \times 2 \text{ seashells/group} = 12 \text{ seashells}
     \]

5. **Total Seashells:**
   - The total number of seashells brought back is **12**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
