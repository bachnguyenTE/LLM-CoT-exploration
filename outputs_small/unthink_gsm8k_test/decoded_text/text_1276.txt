To determine how many feet of crepe-paper James needs to buy, we'll calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Given:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20\text{ft} + 15\text{ft}) = 2 \times 35\text{ft} = 70\text{ft}
\]

Therefore, James needs to buy **70 feet** of crepe-paper.
