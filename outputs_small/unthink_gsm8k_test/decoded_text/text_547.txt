To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, let's analyze the pattern step by step.

1. **First Round (Round 1):**
   - **Number of families notified:** 3
   - **Explanation:** Ali calls 3 families.

2. **Second Round (Round 2):**
   - Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families.
   - **Number of new families notified:** \(3 \times 3 = 9\)
   - **Total families notified so far:** \(3 + 9 = 12\)

3. **Third Round (Round 3):**
   - Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families.
   - **Number of new families notified:** \(9 \times 3 = 27\)
   - **Total families notified so far:** \(12 + 27 = 39\)

4. **Fourth Round (Round 4):**
   - Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families.
   - **Number of new families notified:** \(27 \times 3 = 81\)
   - **Total families notified so far:** \(39 + 81 = 120\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{120}\)
