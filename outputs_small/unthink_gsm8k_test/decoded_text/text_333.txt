To determine the cost difference between the two offers, let's calculate the total cost for each furniture store and then find the difference.

### **Furniture United:**
- **Advance Payment:** \$1,350
- **Monthly Installments:** 6 payments of \$350 each

\[
\text{Total Installments} = 6 \times \$350 = \$2,100
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance Payment} + \text{Total Installments} = \$1,350 + \$2,100 = \$3,450
\]

### **Cozy Homes:**
- **Advance Payment:** \$1,100
- **Monthly Installments:** 9 payments of \$250 each

\[
\text{Total Installments} = 9 \times \$250 = \$2,250
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance Payment} + \text{Total Installments} = \$1,100 + \$2,250 = \$3,350
\]

### **Cost Difference:**
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Furniture United Total} - \text{Cozy Homes Total} = \$3,450 - \$3,350 = \$100
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$100}
\]
