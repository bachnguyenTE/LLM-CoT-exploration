Q: A basket contains 25 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good. How many oranges are good?

To determine how many oranges are good, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Oranges:** 25

2. **Bad Oranges:** 1

3. **Unripe Oranges:** 20% of 25 = 0.5 (Since you can't have half an orange, this suggests a possible rounding or an error in the problem statement.)

4. **Sour Oranges:** 2

5. **Good Oranges:** The remaining oranges after accounting for bad, unripe, and sour ones.

Let's calculate the number of good oranges step by step:

- **Total Oranges:** 25
- **Bad Oranges:** 1
- **Unripe Oranges:** 20% of 25 = 0.5 (Assuming this is correct, we'll proceed.)
- **Sour Oranges:** 2
- **Good Oranges:** 25 - 1 (bad) - 0.5 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 1.5

However, since you can't have half an orange, there might be a mistake in the problem statement. If we consider only whole numbers, we can adjust:

- **Good Oranges:** 25 - 1 (bad) - 2 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 20

But this doesn't account for the 20% unripe oranges. To reconcile this, let's assume the 20% is rounded to the nearest whole number:

- **Unripe Oranges:** 20% of 25 = 0.5, which we'll approximate to 1 (since you can't have half an orange).

Now, recalculating:

- **Good Oranges:** 25 - 1 (bad) - 1 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 21

But this still doesn't align with the 20% figure. To ensure consistency, let's consider that the 20% is exact:

- **Unripe Oranges:** 20% of 25 = 5
- **Good Oranges:** 25 - 1 (bad) - 5 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 17

This approach assumes that the 20% is exact, and the discrepancy with the 0.5 comes from rounding.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{17}
