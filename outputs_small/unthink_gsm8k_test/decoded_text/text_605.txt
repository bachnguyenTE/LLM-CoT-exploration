**Solution:**

To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we'll break down his earnings into two parts based on the time and price he sold lemonade.

1. **First 4 Hours:**
   - **Cups Sold per Hour:** 15 cups
   - **Price per Cup:** \$0.50
   - **Total Earnings for 4 Hours:**
     \[
     15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} \times 4 \text{ hours} = \$30.00
     \]

2. **Next 2 Hours:**
   - **Cups Sold per Hour:** 10 cups
   - **Price per Cup:** \$0.60
   - **Total Earnings for 2 Hours:**
     \[
     10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} \times 2 \text{ hours} = \$12.00
     \]

3. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{42.00}
\]
