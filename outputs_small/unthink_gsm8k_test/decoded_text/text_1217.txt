**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is \$2.
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - Pauline decided not to give up any visits and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

2. **Calculate the Original Cost:**
   - **Visits per year:** 3
   - **Cost per visit:** \$2
   - **Total visits in 5 years:** \(3 \times 5 = 15\) visits
   - **Total cost in 5 years:** \(15 \times \$2 = \$30\)

3. **Determine the Increased Cost:**
   - **Increase:** 150% of \$2
   - **Increase amount:** \(1.50 \times \$2 = \$3\)
   - **New cost per visit:** \$2 + \$3 = \$5

4. **Calculate the Additional Visits:**
   - **Additional years:** 3
   - **Total visits in 3 additional years:** \(3 \times 3 = 9\) visits
   - **Total cost for additional visits:** \(9 \times \$5 = \$45\)

5. **Calculate the Total Spending:**
   - **Total cost in 5 years:** \$30
   - **Total cost for additional 3 years:** \$45
   - **Total spending:** \$30 + \$45 = **\$75**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{75}
