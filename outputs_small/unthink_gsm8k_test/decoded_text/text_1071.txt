**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the base fee for the party:**
   - The base fee is \$125 for a party of 20 people.

2. **Determine the number of additional guests:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members.
   - Total invited guests: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 25\) (classmates) + \(7\) (dance class) + \(13\) (family) = **25**.
   - However, only **4** people couldn't attend.

3. **Calculate the number of people who will attend:**
   - Total invited: 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family) = **25**.
   - Subtract the 4 who couldn't attend: \(25 - 4 = 21\).

4. **Calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:**
   - The base fee covers 20 people, so the number of additional guests is \(21 - 20 = 1\).
   - Each additional guest costs \$6.
   - Total additional cost: \(1 \times \$6 = \$6\).

5. **Calculate the total party cost:**
   - Base fee: \$125
   - Additional cost: \$6
   - **Total cost:** \$125 + \$6 = **\$131**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{131}
