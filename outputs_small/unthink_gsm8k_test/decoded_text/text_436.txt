**Solution:**

Rory has a cake that weighs **20 ounces**. She cuts the cake into **8 pieces**. Rory and her mom each have one piece. We need to determine the weight of the remaining cake.

1. **Total Weight of the Cake:**  
   The cake weighs **20 ounces**.

2. **Number of Pieces:**  
   The cake is cut into **8 pieces**.

3. **Pieces Consumed:**  
   - Rory has **1 piece**.
   - Her mom has **1 piece**.
   - **Total pieces consumed:** \(1 + 1 = 2\) pieces.

4. **Remaining Pieces:**  
   - Total pieces: \(8\)
   - Consumed pieces: \(2\)
   - **Remaining pieces:** \(8 - 2 = 6\) pieces.

5. **Weight of Remaining Cake:**  
   Since the cake is equally divided into **8 pieces**, each piece weighs:  
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   \]
   
   Therefore, the weight of the remaining **6 pieces** is:  
   \[
   6 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The remaining cake weighs \(\boxed{15}\) ounces.
