Q: Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby’s shoes?

To determine the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Length of Topher’s shoes = 8 feet 4 inches
- Length of Topher’s shoes = 9 times the length of Bobby’s shoes + 10 inches

**Step 1: Convert Topher’s shoe length to inches.**

First, convert 8 feet to inches:
\[
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
\]
Add the additional 4 inches:
\[
96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}
\]
So, Topher’s shoes are 100 inches long.

**Step 2: Set up the equation.**

Let \( B \) represent the length of Bobby’s shoes in inches.

According to the problem:
\[
\text{Topher’s shoes} = 9 \times B + 10
\]
Substitute the known value:
\[
100 = 9B + 10
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( B \).**

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
100 - 10 = 9B
\]
\[
90 = 9B
\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[
B = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ inches}}
\]
