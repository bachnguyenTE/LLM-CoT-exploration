**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Pension Structure:**
   - **Pension for 40 years:** Marcy gets an annual pension of **\$50,000/year**.
   - **Starting after 20 years:** She becomes entitled to **5% of the value of the pension per year**.
   - **Quits after 30 years:** We need to find her annual pension.

2. **Calculating the Pension After 22 Years:**
   - **Total years of pension:** 44 years.
   - **Annual pension:** \$55,000/year.
   - **Total pension received:** 
     \[
     44 \text{ years} \times \$55,000/\text{year} = \$2,420,000
     \]

3. **Calculating the Pension After 30 Years:**
   - **Years of pension:** 30 years.
   - **Annual pension after 22 years:** 
     \[
     5\% \times \$55,000 = 0.05 \times \$555,000 = \$2,775,000
     \]
   - **Total pension received after 30 years:**
     \[
     30 \text{ years} \times \$2,775,000/\text{year} = \$83,250,00
     \]

4. **Final Annual Pension:**
   - After 30 years, Marcy will receive **\$2,775,000** annually.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$2,775,000}
\]
