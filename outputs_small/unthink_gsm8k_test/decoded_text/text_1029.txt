Q: As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons Sally finally carried into the school.

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - **Red Balloons:** 25
   - **Green Balloons:** 7
   - **Yellow Balloons:** 12

2. **Effect of the Wind:**
   - **Red Balloons:** 40% burst.
     - **Bursted Red Balloons:** \( 40\% \) of 25 = \( 0.4 \times 25 = 10 \)
     - **Remaining Red Balloons:** \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)
   - **Yellow Balloons:** A random accident caused half to burst.
     - **Bursted Yellow Balloons:** \( 50\% \) of 12 = \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \)
     - **Remaining Yellow Balloons:** \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

3. **Additional Balloons:**
   - **Blue Balloons:** 8 were caught in a tree.
   - **Added Balloons:** 75% of the 8 blue balloons were added.
     - **Added Balloons:** \( 75\% \) of 8 = \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)
     - **Total Blue Balloons After Addition:** \( 8 + 6 = 14 \)

4. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**
   - **Red Balloons:** 15
   - **Green Balloons:** 7
   - **Yellow Balloons:** 6
   - **Blue Balloons:** 14

   - **Total Balloons:** \( 15 + 7 + 6 + 14 = 42 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{42}\)
