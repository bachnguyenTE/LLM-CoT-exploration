Q: Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.

1. **First Set of Flowers:**
   - Rose picks **3 flowers** with **5 petals each**.
   - **Total petals:** \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) petals.

2. **Second Set of Flowers:**
   - Rose picks **4 flowers** with **6 petals each**.
   - **Total petals:** \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) petals.

3. **Third Set of Flowers:**
   - Rose picks **5 flowers** with **4 petals each**.
   - **Total petals:** \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) petals.

4. **Fourth Set of Flowers:**
   - Rose picks **6 flowers** with **7 petals each**.
   - **Total petals:** \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) petals.

5. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Add up all the petals from each set:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
     \]

6. **Dropping and Blowing Away:**
   - Rose drops **1 flower** from each set.
   - **Total flowers dropped:** \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \) flowers.
   - **Total petals lost:** \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) petals.

7. **Remaining Petals:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total petals:
     \[
     101 - 4 = 97 \text{ petals}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{97}
\]
