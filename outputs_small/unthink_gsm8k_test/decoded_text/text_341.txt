Q: A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) = weight of the pink frog
   - Let \( B \) = weight of the blue beetle
   - Let \( G \) = weight of the green toad
   - Let \( Y \) = weight of the yellow snake
   - Let \( R \) = weight of the red bird
   - Let \( C \) = weight of the container

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - \( P = B = G \) (The pink frog, blue beetle, and green toad all weigh the same)
   - \( P = Y - 10 \) (The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake)
   - \( P = R + 20 \) (The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird)
   - \( C = 20 \) (The container weighs 20 pounds)

3. **Given Value:**
   - \( P = 50 \) pounds

4. **Find the Weights of Other Animals:**
   - Since \( P = B = G \), then:
     - \( B = 50 \) pounds
     - \( G = 50 \) pounds
   - From \( P = Y - 10 \):
     - \( Y = P + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) pounds
   - From \( P = R + 20 \):
     - \( R = P - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \) pounds

5. **Calculate Total Weight:**
   - Total weight = \( P + B + G + Y + R + C \)
   - Total weight = \( 50 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 30 + 20 \)
   - Total weight = \( 265 \) \) pounds

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{265\ \text{ pounds}}
\]
