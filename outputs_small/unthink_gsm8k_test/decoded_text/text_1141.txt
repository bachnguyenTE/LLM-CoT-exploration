Q: If Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days and then increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, how many dozens of eggs will Chester need for 60 days?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
</think>

**Solution:**

Chester eats eggs for a total of 60 days. We'll break this down into two parts:

1. **First 30 Days:**
   - **Eggs per day:** 3
   - **Total eggs for 30 days:** \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) eggs

2. **Next 30 Days:**
   - **Eggs per day:** 5
   - **Total eggs for 30 days:** \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) eggs

3. **Total Eggs Over 60 Days:**
   - **Total eggs:** \( 90 + 150 = 246 \) eggs

4. **Convert Total Eggs to Dozens:**
   - **1 dozen = 12 eggs**
   - **Total dozens:** \( \frac{246}{12} = 20.5 \) dozen

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{22.5}
