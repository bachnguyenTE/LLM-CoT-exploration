Let's break down the problem step by step to determine Linus's total profit.

1. **Cost Price:**
   - Linus buys each mobile device for **\$20**.
   - He buys **2 devices** last Monday and **4 devices** last Tuesday.
   - **Total cost price** = (2 + 4) devices × \$20/device = **12 devices × \$20/device = \$240**

2. **Selling Price:**
   - Linus sells each device for **twice the original price**, which is **2 × \$20 = \$40**.
   - He sells **2 devices** last Monday and **4 devices** last Tuesday.
   - **Total selling price** = (2 + 4) devices × \$40/device = **6 devices × \$40/device = \$240**

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - **Profit** = **Total selling price** - **Total cost price**
   - **Profit** = \$240 - \$240 = **\$0**

Linus earned **\$0** in profit after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.
