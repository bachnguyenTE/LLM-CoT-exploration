**Solution:**

To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we'll break down the costs and calculate the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Renting the Studio:**
   - **Daily Rental Cost:** \$25
   - **Days rented per week:** 3
   - **Weekly Rental Cost:** \( 25 \times 3 = \$75 \)
   - **Monthly Rental Cost:** Assuming 4 weeks in a month, \( 75 \times 4 = \$300 \)

2. **Cost Per Student Per Session:**
   - **Cost per student:** \$1.50

3. **Total Students:**
   - **Current Students:** 10

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - **Total Revenue from Students:** \( 10 \times 1.50 = \$15.00 \)
   - **Total Monthly Earnings:** \( 300 + 15.00 = \$315.00 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$315.00}
