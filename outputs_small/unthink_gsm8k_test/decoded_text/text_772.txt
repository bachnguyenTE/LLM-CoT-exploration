To determine what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, let's break down the information step by step.

**Total Weekend Time:**
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
- **Total:** 7 + 5 = **12 hours**

**Time Spent on Reading:**
- She reads for **3 hours**.

**Remaining Time After Reading:**
- Total time: 12 hours
- Time spent reading: 3 hours
- **Remaining time:** 12 - 3 = **9 hours**

**Time Spent on Video Games:**
- She plays video games for **1/3 of the remaining time**.
- **Time spent on video games:** (1/3) * 9 = **3 hours**

**Time Spent on Soccer:**
- Total time spent on soccer = Total time - Time spent reading - Time spent on video games
- **Time spent on soccer:** 12 - 3 - 3 = **6 hours**

**Percentage of Weekend Spent on Soccer:**
- **Percentage:** (6 / 12) * 100% = **50%**

\boxed{50\%}
