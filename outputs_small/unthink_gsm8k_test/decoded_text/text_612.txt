To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, let's break down the information provided:

1. **First Player:**
   - Eaten a **6-ounce steak**.

2. **Second Player:**
   - Eaten **beef tips**, with **8 beef tips** (each ounce in size).

3. **Third Player:**
   - Eaten a **one-pound steak**.

4. **Fourth and Fifth Players:**
   - Ordered **vegetarian meals**.

Now, let's calculate the total ounces:

- **First Player:** 6 ounces
- **Second Player:** 8 ounces
- **Third Player:** 1 pound = 16 ounces (since 1 pound = 16 ounces)
- **Fourth and Fifth Players:** Not specified in ounces, so we'll assume they didn't consume any meat.

**Total Meat Consumed:**
\[
6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 6 \text{ ounces} = 20 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\boxed{20\ \text{ounces}}
\]
