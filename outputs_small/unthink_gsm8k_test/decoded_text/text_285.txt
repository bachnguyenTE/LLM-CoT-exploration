**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Ann's Current Age:**
   - Ann is **9 years old**.

2. **Find Out Her Brother's Current Age:**
   - Ann's brother is **twice** as old as Ann.
   - So, Brother's current age = 2 × Ann's age = 2 × 9 = **18 years old**.

3. **Calculate the Brother's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the brother will be 3 years older.
   - Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3 = 18 + 3 = **21 years old**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{21}
