Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many kilograms of apples James will have left.

1. **Total Apples Bought:**
   \[
   12\ \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Apples Desired by Pierre:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 12\ \text{kg} = 3\ \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Apples Desired by Paul:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12\ \text{kg} = 4\ \text{kg}
   \]

4. **Total Apples Desired by Pierre and Paul:**
   \[
   3\ \text{kg} + 4\ \text{kg} = 7\ \text{kg}
   \]

5. **Apples Left for James:**
   \[
   12\ \text{kg} - 7\ \text{kg} = 5\ \text{kg}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5\ \text{kg}}
\]
