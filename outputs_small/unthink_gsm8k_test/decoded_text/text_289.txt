Q: A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?

**Solution:**

We are given the following information:

- **Fast Lane Car:**
  - Speed: \( 60 \) miles per hour (\( 60 \,0000 \) \)
  - Distance traveled: \( 480 \) miles

- **Slow Lane Car:**
  - Speed: Half of the fast lane car's speed, so \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour (\(33,0000 \) )

We need to find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of \( 480 \) miles.

**Step 1: Understand the relationship between speed, distance, and time.**

The formula that relates these three quantities is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the slow lane car.**

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{slow}}} = \frac{480}{33}
\]

**Step 3: Perform the division.**

\[
\frac{480}{33} = 14.54545454545 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the decimal hours into hours and minutes.**

- The integer part is \( 14 \) hours.
- The decimal part is \( 0.54545454545 \) hours.
- Multiply by \( 60 \) to convert to minutes:

\[
0.54545454545 \times 60 = 33 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{14 \text{ hours and } 33 \text{ minutes}}
\]
