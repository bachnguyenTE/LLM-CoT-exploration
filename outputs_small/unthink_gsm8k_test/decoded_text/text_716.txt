**Solution:**

To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we'll calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs:**
   - **Number of eggs:** 6
   - **Calories per egg:** 75
   - **Total calories from eggs:** \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories

2. **Cheese:**
   - **Ounces of cheese:** 2
   - **Calories per ounce of cheese:** 120
   - **Total calories from cheese:** \( 2 \times 120 = 240 \) calories

3. **Ham:**
   - **Ham is equal to the amount of cheese:** 2 ounces
   - **Calories per ounce of ham:** 40
   - **Total calories from ham:** \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) calories

4. **Total Calories:**
   - **Sum of all calories:** \( 450 + 240 + 80 = 778 \) calories

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{778}
\]
