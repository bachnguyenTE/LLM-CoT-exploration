Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

### Step 1: Determine the hourly rate and total hours worked

- **Hourly rate:** \$10 per hour
- **Jill's hours:**
  - Saturday: 2 hours
  - Sunday: 1 hour
- **John's hours:**
  - Saturday: Twice as long as Jill → \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
  - Sunday: Three times as long as Jill → \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for each

- **Jill's total earnings:**
  \[
  \text{Total} = (\text{Saturday} + \text{Sunday}) \times \text{Hourly rate} = (2 + 1) \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = \$30
  \]
  
- **John's total earnings:**
  \[
  \text{Total} = (\text{Saturday} + \text{Sunday}) \times \text{Hourly rate} = (4 + 3) \times 10 = 7 \times 10 = \$70
  \]

### Step 3: Find the difference in earnings

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{John's earnings} - \text{Jill's earnings} = 70 - 30 = \$40
\]

\[
\boxed{40}
\]
