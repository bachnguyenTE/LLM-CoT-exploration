To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, let's break down his schedule:

1. **Total Time Available:** 9 hours
2. **Time Spent on Inpatient Rounds:**
   - **Number of Inpatient Rounds:** 9
   - **Time per Round:** 20 minutes
   - **Total Time:** \( 9 \text{ rounds} \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \)
3. **Time Spent on Ten Appointments:**
   - **Number of Appointments:** 10
   - **Time per Appointment:** 30 minutes
   - **Total Time:** \( 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes} \)
4. **Total Time Spent on Patients:**
   - **Total Time:** \( 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 486 \text{ minutes} \)
5. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - \( 486 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 8 \text{ hours and } 6 \text{ minutes} \)
6. **Time Left for Updating Records:**
   - **Total Time Available:** 9 hours
   - **Time Spent:** 8 hours and 6 minutes
   - **Time Left:** \( 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours and } 6 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 54 \text{ minutes} \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{1 \text{ hour and } 54 \text{ minutes}}\)
