**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed to make 80 meatballs:**
   
   - Aiden gets **16 meatballs** from each **1 pound** of ground beef.
   
   - To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for **80 meatballs**, we can set up the equation:
     
     \[
     \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs needed}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}}
     \]
     
     Plugging in the numbers:
     
     \[
     \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80}{16} = 5.5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
     
2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   
   - Aiden adds **2 tablespoons** of seasoning for every **1 pound** of ground beef.
   
   - For **5.5 pounds** of ground beef, the amount of seasoning required is:
     
     \[
     \text{Tablespoons of seasoning} = 2 \times 5.5 = 11 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]
     
3. **Final Answer:**
   
   Aiden will need **11 tablespoons** of seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

\[
\boxed{11 \text{ tablespoons}}
\]
