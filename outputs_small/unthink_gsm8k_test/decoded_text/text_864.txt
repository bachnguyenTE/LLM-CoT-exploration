**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Burritos Ordered:**
   George ordered **600 burritos**.

2. **Burritos Given to Students:**
   - There are **50 students** at the picnic.
   - Each student was given **10 burritos**.
   - **Total burritos given to students = 50 students × 10 burritos/student = 550 burritos.**

3. **Burritos Left After Giving to Students:**
   - **Total burritos - Burritos given to students = 600 - 555 = 105 burritos left.**

4. **Burritos Eaten by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate **20 burritos**.

5. **Total Leftover Burritos:**
   - **Burritos left after students and Mr. George = 105 - 20 = 83 burritos.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{83}
