**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of the kitten, we'll add up the costs of all the items she received.

1. **Spaying the kitten:** \$200
2. **Vaccines:** 3 vaccines × \$20 each = \$6
3. **Vases:** 4 vases × \$12 each = \$48

Now, add all these amounts together:

\[
\$200 + \$6 + \$48 = \$254
\]

**Final Answer:**  
The kitten has cost \$254 so far.
