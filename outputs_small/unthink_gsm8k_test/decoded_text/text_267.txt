Q: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total time from starting the oil to cooking the chicken.

1. **Initial Heating:**
   - **Time taken to heat oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.

2. **Second Heating:**
   - **Desired temperature:** 400 degrees.
   - **Time taken:** 40% longer than the first heating.
     - **40% of 20 minutes:** \( 0.40 \times 22 = 8.8 \) minutes.
     - **Total time for second heating:** \( 22 + 8.8 = 30.8 \) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time:**
   - **Time taken to cook chicken:** 5 minutes less than the second heating.
     - **Total cooking time:** \( 33.8 - 5 = 28.8 \) minutes.

4. **Total Time from Start to Cooking:**
   - **Initial heating + Second heating + Cooking time:**
     - \( 22 + 33.8 + 28.8 = 84.6 \) minutes.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{84.6\ \text{minutes}}
\]
