To determine Sheila's new credit card balance, let's break down each step:

1. **Initial Charges:**
   - **First Credit Card Purchase:** \$85.00
   - **Second Credit Card Purchase:** \$20.00 (after discounts)

2. **Calculating the Discounts:**
   - **Frying Pan:** 20% off \$20.00
     - **Discount:** 0.20 × 20.00 = \$4.00
     - **Amount Paid:** 20.00 - 4.00 = \$16.00
   - **Set of Towels:** 10% off \$30.00
     - **Discount:** 0.10 × 30.00 = \$3.00
     - **Amount Paid:** 30.00 - 3.00 = \$27.00

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - **First Purchase:** \$85.00
   - **Second Purchase:** \$16.00 + \$27.00 = \$43.00
   - **Total:** \$85.00 + \$43.00 = **\$128.00**

4. **New Credit Card Balance:**
   - **Initial Balance:** \$85.00
   - **Subtract Returns:** \$15.00
   - **Total Paid:** \$128.00
   - **New Balance:** \$128.00 - \$15.00 = **\$113.00**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{113.00}
