To determine Cayley's total commission from the sales of newspapers, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the commission for the New York Times:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 6
   - **Price per copy:** \$5
   - **Commission rate:** 10%
   - **Commission earned:** \( 6 \times \$5 \times 10\% = \$30 \)

2. **Calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 10
   - **Price per copy:** \$15
   - **Commission rate:** 8%
   - **Commission earned:** \( 10 \times \$15 \times 8\% = \$40 \)

3. **Total commission earned:**
   - **Total:** \( \$33 + \$44 = \$77 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{77}\)
