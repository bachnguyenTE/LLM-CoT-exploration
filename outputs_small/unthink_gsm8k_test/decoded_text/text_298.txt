To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, let's break down the bidding process step by step.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts by bidding \$200.

2. **Bidding Process:**
   - Carmen continues bidding after each of the 3 other people who participate in the auction.
   - Each subsequent bid increases by \$50.
   - Carmen wins the auction after all 3 other people have bid.

3. **Calculating the Final Bid:**
   - Since Carmen wins after each of the 3 other people, her final bid is:
     \[
     200 + (3 \times 50) = 200 + 150 = 255
     \]

4. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Carmen pays the final bid amount of \$255 to win the auction.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{255}
\]
