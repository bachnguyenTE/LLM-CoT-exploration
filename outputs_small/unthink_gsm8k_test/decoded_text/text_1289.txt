Q: Octavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?

To determine the total square footage of the quilt, we'll calculate the fabric used for each type of shirt and then sum them up.

1. **Small Shirts:**
   - **Number of shirts:** 111
   - **Square feet per shirt:** 3
   - **Total fabric:** \( 111 \times 3 = 333 \) square feet

2. **Medium Shirts:**
   - **Number of shirts:** 8
   - **Square feet per shirt:** 4
   - **Total fabric:** \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet

3. **Large Shirts:**
   - **Number of shirts:** 6
   - **Square feet per shirt:** 6
   - **Total fabric:** \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet

4. **Total Fabric:**
   - **Sum all the fabric:** \( 333 + 32 + 36 = 371 \) square feet

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{371}
