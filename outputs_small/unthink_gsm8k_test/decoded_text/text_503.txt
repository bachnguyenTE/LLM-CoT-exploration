Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
3. The width of the chair is 3 feet.

**Step 1: Determine the width of the rug.**

We know the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide:

\[
\text{Width of rug} = \text{Width of chair} + 5 \text{ feet} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the length of the couch.**

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, find twice the width of the rug:

\[
2 \times \text{Width of rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Then, add 2 feet to this value to get the length of the couch:

\[
\text{Length of couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{18 \text{ feet}}
\]
