Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of fish in the tank: 66
- One-third of the fish have red stripes.
- \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.**

\[
\text{Number of red-striped fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for red-striped fish.**

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.**

\[
\text{Number of blue-striped fish} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

**Step 4: Find the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes.**

\[
\text{Total fish with red and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{42}
\]
