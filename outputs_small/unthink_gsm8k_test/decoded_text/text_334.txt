To determine how many paintball guns each person would have if they shared them equally, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Paintball Guns:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{DJ's guns} + \text{Nick's guns} + \text{RJ's guns} + \text{Richard's guns}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of People Sharing the Guns:**
   \[
   \text{Number of People} = 4 \quad (\text{DJ, Nick, RJ, Richard})
   \]

3. **Divide the Total Number of Guns by the Number of People:**
   \[
   \text{Guns per Person} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of People}} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
