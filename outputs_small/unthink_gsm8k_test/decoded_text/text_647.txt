Q: Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?

**Solution:**

To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we'll break down the problem into two parts: digging through soil and digging through clay.

1. **Digging Through Soil:**
   - **Depth:** 24 feet
   - **Rate:** 4 feet per hour
   - **Time Calculation:** 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Depth}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Digging Through Clay:**
   - **Depth:** 8 feet
   - **Rate:** Half of 4 feet per hour, which is 2 feet per hour
   - **Time Calculation:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Depth}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   \[
   6 \text{ hours (soil)} + 4 \text{ hours (clay)} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
It will take Bill **10 hours** to dig the well.
