**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rides:**
   - Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
   - He did this for 14 days.

   So, the total number of rides is:
   \[
   2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for each type of ride:**
   - Morning rides cost approximately \$6 each.
   - Afternoon rides cost approximately \$2 each.

3. **Calculate the total cost for morning rides:**
   \[
   28 \text{ rides} \times \$6/\text{ride} = \$168
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for afternoon rides:**
   \[
   28 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$56
   \]

5. **Add both costs to find the total expenditure:**
   \[
   \$168 + \$56 = \$124
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{124}
\]
