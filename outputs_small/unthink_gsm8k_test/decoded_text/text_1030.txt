Q: Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we'll analyze each scenario step by step.

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - **Probability:** 50% (0.5)
   - **Outcome:** Marcus doesn't have homework.
   
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - **Probability:** 40% (0.4)
   - **Outcome:** Marcus gets an extension.
   
3. **No Extension:**
   - **Probability:** 56% (1 - 0.4 = 0.6)
     - **Subsequent Extension:**
       - **Probability:** 20% (0.2)
       - **Outcome:** Marcus gets an extension.
     - **No Extension:**
       - **Probability:** 80% (1 - 0.2 = 0.8)
       - **Outcome:** Marcus doesn't need to turn in homework.

4. **Final Outcome:**
   - **Probability Marcus needs to turn in homework:** 80% (0.8)

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{80\%}
