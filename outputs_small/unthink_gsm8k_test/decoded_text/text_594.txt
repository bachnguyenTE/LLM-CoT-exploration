**Solution:**

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   
   - 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram is:
     
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms per day:**
   
   - Multiply the protein content per gram by the daily consumption:
     
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.003 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6.6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
     \]

3. **Determine the protein content for a week:**
   
   - Multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (number of days in a week):
     
     \[
     6.6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 46.2 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{46.2 \text{ grams of protein per week}}
\]
