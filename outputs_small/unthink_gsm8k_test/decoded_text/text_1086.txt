Q: Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?

To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles in that month, we'll break down the sales by bike type and calculate the total revenue.

1. **Total Bikes Sold:**
   \[
   \text{Total Bikes} = 300
   \]

2. **Number of Trekking Bikes Sold:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Trekking Bikes} = 50\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.5 \times 300 = 150
   \]

3. **Number of BMX Bikes Sold:**
   \[
   \text{Number of BMX Bikes} = 15\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

4. **Number of MTB Bikes Sold:**
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB Bikes} = \text{Total Bikes} - \text{Number of Trekking Bikes} - \text{Number of BMX Bikes}
   \]
   \[
   = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
   \]

5. **Calculate Revenue for Each Bike Type:**
   - **MTB:**
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 105 \times \$500 = \$52,500
     \]
   - **BMX:**
     \[
     \text{Price of BMX} = \frac{\$500}{2} = \$250
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 45 \times \$250 = \$11,250
     \]
   - **Trekking:**
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 150 \times \$450 = \$67,500
     \]

6. **Total Revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \$52,500 + \$11,250 + \$67,500 = \$131,250
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$131,\!250}
\]
