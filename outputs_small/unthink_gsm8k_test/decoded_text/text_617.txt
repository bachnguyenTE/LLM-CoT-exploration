Q: Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Prince's daily meat sales:**
   
   Prince sells **15 kg** of meat every hour.
   
   He works **10 hours** a day.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily sales} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \,000 \,000 \,000 \, \text{hours/day} = 150,000 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days needed to sell 750 kg:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150,000 \, \text{kg/day}} = 0.142857 \, \text{days}
   \]
   
   To make it more understandable:
   
   \[
   0.142857 \, \text{days} \times 24 \,000 \, \text{hours/day} \approx 3.4 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   
   So, Prince will need approximately **3.4 hours** to sell the entire bull.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3.4 \text{ hours}}
\]
