**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of brownies.

2. **Set Up the Relationship:**
   - According to the problem, Carly makes **2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes**.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     B = 3C - 2
     \]

3. **Determine the Total Number of Treats:**
   - Each person in the class gets **2 treats**.
   - There are **5 people** in the class.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats is:
     \[
     \text{Total Treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

4. **Express Total Treats in Terms of Cupcakes and Brownies:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies:
     \[
     C + B = 10
     \]

5. **Substitute the Expression for \( B \) into the Total Treats Equation:**
   - From step 2, \( B = 3C - 2 \).
   - Substitute into the equation:
     \[
     C + (3C - 2) = 10
     \]

6. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4C - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4C = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     C = 3
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
