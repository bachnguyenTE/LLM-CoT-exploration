**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) = number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B \) = number of bananas Jamal has.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_{\text{Andrea}} = A + 8 \).
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( B_{\text{Andrea}} = \frac{1}{2}B \).
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( B = A + 4 \).
   - Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_{\text{Andrea}} = 52 \).

3. **Find Jamal's Apples:**
   - Since \( A_{\text{Andrea}} = A + 8 \) and \( A_{\text{Andrea}} = 52 \):
     \[
     52 = A + 8 \implies A = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]
   - So, Jamal has 44 apples.

4. **Find Jamal's Bananas:**
   - From \( B = A + 4 \):
     \[
     B = 44 + 4 = 48
     \]
   - So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

5. **Find Andrea's Bananas:**
   - From \( B_{\text{Andrea}} = \frac{1}{2}B \):
     \[
     B_{\text{Andrea}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
     \]
   - So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

6. **Calculate Total Fruits:**
   - **Andrea's Fruits:**
     \[
     \text{Apples} + \text{Bananas} = 52 + 24 = 76
     \]
   - **Jamal's Fruits:**
     \[
     \text{Apples} + \text{Bananas} = 44 + 48 = 52
     \]
   - **Total Fruits:**
     \[
     76 + 52 = 128
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{128}
\]
