**Solution:**

To determine the total volume of medicine in 8 doses, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of one dose:**
   - **First medicine:** 14 mL
   - **Second medicine:** 3 times the first medicine = \( 3 \times 14\,000 = 42\, \text{mL} \)
   - **Total per dose:** \( 14\,000 + 42\, \text{mL} = 56\, \text{mL} \)

2. **Calculate the total volume for 8 doses:**
   - **Total volume:** \( 56\,000 \times 8 = 448\, \text{mL} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{448\,000\ \text{mL}}
\]
