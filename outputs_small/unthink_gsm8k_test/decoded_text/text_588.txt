Q: Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?

**Solution:**

Jared's typing speeds over three tests are as follows:

1. **First Test:** 47 WPM
2. **Second Test:** 52 WPM
3. **Third Test:** 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

To find the **average** of these three measurements, we use the formula for the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

**Step 1:** Calculate the sum of the three measurements.

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

**Step 2:** Divide the sum by the number of measurements (which is 3).

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{52}
\]
