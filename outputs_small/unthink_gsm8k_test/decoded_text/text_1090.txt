Let's determine the height of Caroline's fourth child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   - **Height:** 6 feet
   - **Convert feet to inches:** \(6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}\)

2. **Second Child:**
   - **Height:** 2 inches taller than the first child
   - **Height:** \(72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}\)

3. **Third Child:**
   - **Height:** 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - **Height:** \(74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}\)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - **Height:** 3 inches taller than the third child
   - **Height:** \(69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{72}\) inches
