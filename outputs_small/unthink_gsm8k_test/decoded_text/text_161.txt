Let's determine the total number of fish Anakin and Locsin were able to catch.

**Anakin's Catch:**
- **Starfish:** 10
- **Sea Horses:** 6
- **Clownfish:** 3

**Total for Anakin:**
\[
10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 20 \text{ fish}
\]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- **Starfish:** 10 - 5 = 5
- **Sea Horses:** 6 - 3 = 3
- **Clownfish:** 3 + 2 = 5

**Total for Locsin:**
\[
5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish}
\]

**Combined Total:**
\[
22 \text{ (Anakin)} + 13 \text{ (Locsin)} = 35 \text{ fish}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{35}
\]
