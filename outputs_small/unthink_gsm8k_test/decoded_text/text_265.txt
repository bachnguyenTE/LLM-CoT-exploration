Q: Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?

To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we'll calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee based on the selling price of the property.

1. **Brokerage Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \$350,\!000 = 0.05 \times 350,\!000 = \$17,\!750
   \]

2. **Transfer Fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \$350,\!000 = 0.12 \times 350,\!000 = \$42,\!000
   \]

3. **Total Additional Fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total Fees} = \$17,\!750 + \$42,\!000 = \$59,\!750
   \]

4. **Total Price of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = \$350,\!000 + \$59,\!750 = \$410,\!750
   \]

5. **Difference from Budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$410,\!750 - \$400,\!000 = \$10,\!750
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{\$10,\!750}\)
