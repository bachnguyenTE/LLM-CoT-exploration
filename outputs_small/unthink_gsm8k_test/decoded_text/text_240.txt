Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. James has 6 more candies than Robert.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert.
3. John has 54 candies.

**Step 1: Determine how many candies Robert has.**

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.

\[
\text{John's candies} = 2R
\]

Given that John has 54 candies:

\[
54 = 2R
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( R \).**

\[
R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

**Step 3: Determine how many candies James has.**

James has 6 more candies than Robert.

\[
\text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
\]

**Step 4: Find how many more candies John has than James.**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{21}
\]
