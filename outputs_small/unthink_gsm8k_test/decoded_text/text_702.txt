Q: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. **Gissela's truck** can carry **4,000 pounds** of gravel.
2. **Gordy's truck** can carry **800 pounds more** than Gissela's truck.
3. **Combined capacity** of Gissela's, Gordy's, and **Gary's trucks** is **11,600 pounds**.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( G \) be the capacity of Gissela's truck.
- Let \( G_g \) be the capacity of Gordy's truck.
- Let \( G_a \) be the capacity of Gary's truck.

**From the problem:**
1. \( G = 4,000 \) pounds.
2. \( G_g = G + 800 = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \) pounds.
3. The combined capacity of all three trucks is \( G + G_g + G_a = 11,600 \) pounds.

**Substitute the known values into the equation:**
\[
4,000 + 4,800 + G_a = 11,600
\]

**Calculate the sum of G and \( G_g \):**
\[
4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800
\]

**Now, solve for \( G_a \):**
\[
8,800 + G_a = 11,600
\]
\[
G_a = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800
\]

**Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2,800}\) pounds of gravel.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2800}
\]
