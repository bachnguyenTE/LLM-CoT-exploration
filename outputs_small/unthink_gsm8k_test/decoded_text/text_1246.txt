**Solution:**

Ara has been playing basketball for **4 years**, and she plays **40 games** each year. To find the total number of games she has played, we multiply the number of years by the number of games per year:

\[
\text{Total games} = 4 \text{ years} \times 40 \text{ games/year} = 160 \text{ games}
\]

Each game she scores **21 points**. To find the total points scored, we multiply the total number of games by the points per game:

\[
\text{Total points} = 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ point/game} = 336 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{336}
\]
