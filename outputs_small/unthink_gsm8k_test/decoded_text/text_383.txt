To determine Millie's profit per hour, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cost:**
   - Millie spends \$18 to buy supplies.

2. **Total Lemonade Available:**
   - She can make 3 pitchers.
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - **Total cups = 3 pitchers × 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.**

3. **Revenue from Selling Lemonade:**
   - She sells each cup for \$1.
   - **Total revenue = 36 cups × \$1/cup = \$36.**

4. **Total Hours to Sell All Lemonade:**
   - She sells 4 cups per hour.
   - **Total hours = 36 cups ÷ 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.**

5. **Total Profit:**
   - **Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \$36 - \$18 = \$18.**

6. **Profit per Hour:**
   - **Profit per hour = Total profit ÷ Total hours = \$18 ÷ 9 hours = \$2 per hour.**

**Final Answer:**
