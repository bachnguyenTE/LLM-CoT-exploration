To determine how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, let's break down her schedule:

1. **Tuesday:** 1 hour of dance practice.
2. **Thursday:** 2 hours of dance practice.
3. **Saturday:** Twice as long as Tuesday's practice, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, add up all the hours:

\[
1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{5}\) hours a week.
