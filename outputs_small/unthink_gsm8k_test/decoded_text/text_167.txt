Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.
- Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

**Given:**
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]

**Substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
\[
(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
\]
\[
B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
3B = 28 - 4
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

**Now, find Seth's age:**
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old.
