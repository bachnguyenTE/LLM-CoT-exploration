**Solution:**

To determine how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, follow these steps:

1. **Total Time Spent on Calls:**
   - Tim spends **6 hours** each day at work answering phones.
   - Over **5 days**, the total time spent on calls is:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - Since the call handling time is given in minutes, convert the total time from hours to minutes:
     \[
     30 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate Number of Calls:**
   - Each call takes **15 minutes** to handle.
   - The number of calls Tim can handle in 5 days is:
     \[
     \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
