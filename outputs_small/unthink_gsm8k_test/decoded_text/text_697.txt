Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of **great grand-babies** at the reunion.

1. **Great Grandma Jones's Children:**
   - Great Grandma Jones has **3 children**.
   - These 3 children are **Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren**.

2. **Great Grandma Jones's Great Grand-Babies:**
   - Each of these 3 grandchildren has **3 children**.
   - So, the number of **great grand-babies** is:
     \[
     3 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ children each} = 9 \text{ great grand-babies}
     \]

3. **Great Grandma Jones's Great Grand-Baby's Great Grand-Babies:**
   - Each of these 9 great grand-babies has **3 children**.
   - So, the number of **great grand-baby's great grand-babies** is:
     \[
     9 \text{ great grand-babies} \times 3 \text{ children each} = 27 \text{ great grand-baby's great grand-babies}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Great Grand babies:**
   - Adding up all the great grand-babies:
     \[
     9 \text{ (great grand-babies)} + 27 \text{ (great grand-baby's great grand-babies)} = 36 \text{ great grand-babies}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
