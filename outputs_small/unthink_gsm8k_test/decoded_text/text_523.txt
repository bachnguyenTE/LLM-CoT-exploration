Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Bakers at Beverly Hills Bakery baked **200** loaves of bread on Monday morning.
- They sold **93** loaves in the morning.
- They sold **39** loaves in the afternoon.
- A **grocery store** returned **6** unsold loaves.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of loaves sold:**
   \[
   \text{Total sold} = \text{Morning sales} + \text{Afternoon sales} = 93 + 39 = 132 \text{ loaves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of loaves remaining after sales:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining loaves after sales} = \text{Total baked} - \text{Total sold} = 200 - 132 = 68 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Account for the loaves returned by the grocery store:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining loaves} = \text{Remaining loaves after sales} - \text{Returned loaves} = 68 - 6 = 62 \text{ loaves}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{62}
\]
