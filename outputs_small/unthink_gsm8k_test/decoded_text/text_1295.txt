**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Ryan's Total Allowance:**
   - Ryan receives \$6 each week for completing chores.
   - He did chores for 3 weeks.
   - **Total Allowance = \$6/week × 3 weeks = \$18.**

2. **Determine the Cost of Ice Cream Cones:**
   - Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends.
   - Each ice cream cone costs \$1.25.
   - **Total Cost for Ice Creams = 4 cones × \$1.25 = \$5.**

3. **Calculate the Remaining Money After Buying Ice Creams:**
   - **Remaining Money = \$18 - \$5 = \$13.**

4. **Determine How Many Movie Tickets Ryan Can Buy:**
   - Each movie ticket costs \$6.50.
   - **Number of Tickets = \$13 ÷ \$6.50 ≈ 1.999.**
   - Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy **1 movie ticket**.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{1}\)
