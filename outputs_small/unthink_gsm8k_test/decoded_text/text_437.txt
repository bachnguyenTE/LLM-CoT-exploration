**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Oranges:**
   - Sitti has 34 oranges.
   - Juris has 22 oranges.
   - **Total Oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.**

2. **Total Friends:**
   - Both Sitti and Juris decide to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends.
   - **Total Friends = 6**

3. **Oranges per Person:**
   - **Oranges per Person = Total Oranges ÷ Total Friends**
   - **Oranges per Person = 56 ÷ 6 ≈ 9.333...**

4. **Expressing the Result:**
   - Since you can't have a fraction of an orange in this context, we can express the answer as a mixed number or a decimal.
   - **9 and 1/3 oranges per person** or **approximately 9.33 oranges per person.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9 \frac{1}{3}}
\]
