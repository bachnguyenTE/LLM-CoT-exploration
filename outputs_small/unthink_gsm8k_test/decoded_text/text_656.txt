**Solution:**

Mike has a 200-page book to read and needs to finish it within 300 days. He plans to read **10 pages per day**.

1. **Calculate the total number of days Mike needs to read the book:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 200 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days Mike will finish reading before the deadline:**
   
   Mike needs **220 days** to complete the book. Since he has **330 days** to finish the assignment, he will finish **220 days** before the deadline.

\[
\boxed{220}
\]
