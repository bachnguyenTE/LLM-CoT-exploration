**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total weight of the flagstones:**
   
   Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Compare the total weight with the truck's capacity:**
   
   The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
   
   \[
   600 \text{ pounds} \leq 2200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
   Since 600 pounds is less than 2200 pounds, one truck is sufficient.

**Answer:** \boxed{1}
