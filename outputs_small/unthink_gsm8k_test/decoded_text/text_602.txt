**Solution:**

To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the plane's speed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:**
   
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2200 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Express the time in hours and minutes:**
   
   \[
   5.5 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours and } 0.5 \times 60 = 5 \text{ hours and } 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5.5 \text{ hours}}
\]
