Q: The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. If the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours, how many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun?

To determine how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours, we'll analyze the situation step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Angle of the Pyramid:** 32 degrees from the ground.
- **Sun's Angular Speed:** 5 degrees per hour.
- **Time of Day:** 10 hours.

### **Assumptions:**
1. The sun moves straight upward from Sahir's house.
2. The pyramid is stationary.
3. The sun's path is a straight line from the pyramid to the ground.

### **Step 1: Understand the Pyramid's Angle**
The pyramid is inclined at 32 degrees from the ground. This means:
- The angle between the pyramid's face and the ground is 32 degrees.

### **Step 2: Calculate the Sun's Angular Position**
The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, it will have moved:
\[
\text{Total Angular Movement} = 5^\circ/\text{hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50^\circ
\]

### **Step 3: Determine the Final Position**
Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves upward:
- **Starting Position:** 32 degrees from the ground.
- **Ending Position:** 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees from the ground.

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{82^\circ}
\]
