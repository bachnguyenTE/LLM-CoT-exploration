Q: A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?

To determine the **net profit** for the food truck, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - **Bread:** 
     - Cost per loaf: \$3.00
     - Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches: 1
     - Total bread cost: \$3.00
   - **Cheeses and condiments:** 
     - Cost per 10 sandwiches: \$30.00
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches: \$30.00
   - **Total cost:** 
     \[
     \$3.0 + \$30.0 = \$33.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - **Selling price per sandwich:** \$7.00
   - **Total revenue for 10 sandwiches:**
     \[
     10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$37.00}
\]
