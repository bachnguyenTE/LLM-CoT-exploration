**Solution:**

To determine how many more bags of flour Mark needs to buy compared to milk, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of flour bags needed:**
   - **Total flour needed:** 3 cups
   - **Flour per bag:** 2 cups
   - **Number of flour bags:** \( \frac{3 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 1.5 \) bags

2. **Calculate the number of milk bottles needed:**
   - **Total milk needed:** 1 cup
   - **Milk per bottle:** 2 cups
   - **Number of milk bottles:** \( \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 0.5 \) bottles

3. **Determine the difference:**
   - **Flour bags needed:** 1.5
   - **Milk bottles needed:** 0.5
   - **Difference:** \( 1.5 - 0.5 = 1 \) bag

**Final Answer:** Mark needs to buy **1 more bag of flour** than bottles of milk.
