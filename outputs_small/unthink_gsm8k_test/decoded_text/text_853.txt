**Solution:**

We need to determine how many hours it would take to clean half of the 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel, given that each room requires 20 minutes of cleaning.

1. **Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. **Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total time (minutes)} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total time (hours)} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15 \text{ hours}}
\]
