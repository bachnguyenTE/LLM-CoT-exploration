**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Molly will pay for catering, we'll calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum them up.

1. **Chicken Salad:**
   - **Number of people:** 10
   - **Cost per person:** \$6.50
   - **Total cost for chicken salad:**  
     \[
     10 \text{ people} \times \$6.50/\text{person} = \$65.00
     \]

2. **Pasta Salad:**
   - **Number of people:** 6
   - **Cost per person:** \$6.00
   - **Total cost for pasta salad:**  
     \[
     6 \text{ people} \times \$6.00/\text{person} = \$36.00
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - **Total cost for chicken salad:** \$65.00
   - **Total cost for pasta salad:** \$36.00
   - **Sum:**  
     \[
     \$65.00 + \$36.00 = \$101.00
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
Molly will pay a total of \(\boxed{\$101.0}\) for the catering.
