Q: At Allan's house, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Allan has **40 cannolis** in his house.
   - The number of **corns** is **twice** the number of cannolis.

   **Calculating Initial Corns:**
   \[
   \text{Corn} = 2 \times \text{Cannoli} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

2. **After Buying More:**
   - Allan **bought 60 more cannolis**.
   - He **bought 40 fewer corns** than the number of cannolis.

   **Calculating New Corns:**
   \[
   \text{New Corns} = \text{Cannoli} - 40 = 40 - 40 = 0 \text{ corns}
   \]
   (Wait, this doesn't make sense. If he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns should be based on the new number of cannolis.)

   **Correct Approach:**
   - **New Cannoli Count:**
     \[
     \text{New Cannoli} = 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
     \]
   - **New Corn Count:**
     \[
     \text{New Corns} = \text{New Cannoli} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
     \]

3. **Total Corns and Cannolis:**
   - **Total Cannoli:**
     \[
     40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
     \]
   - **Total Corns:**
     \[
     80 + 60 = 140 \text{ corns}
     \]
   - **Combined Total:**
     \[
     140 \text{ items}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{140}
\]
