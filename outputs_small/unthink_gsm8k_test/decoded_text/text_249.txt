Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister.

### **Step 1: Determine the Number of Cookies Each Ate Each Day**

- **Monday:**
  - **Sue's Cookies:** 4 times her sister's cookies.
  - **Sister's Cookies:** 5 cookies.
  - **Sue's Cookies:** \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

- **Tuesday:**
  - **Sue's Cookies:** 2 times her sister's cookies.
  - **Sister's Cookies:** 13 cookies.
  - **Sue's Cookies:** \(2 \times13 = 26\) cookies.

### **Step 2: Calculate Total Cookies Eaten by Sue and Her Sister**

- **Total Cookies (Sue):**
  - **Monday:** 20 cookies.
  - **Tuesday:** 26 cookies.
  - **Total:** \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

- **Total Cookies (Sister):**
  - **Monday:** 5 cookies.
  - **Tuesday:** 13 cookies.
  - **Total:** \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

### **Step 3: Calculate Calories Consumed**

- **1 Cookie = 200 Calories**
  
- **Sue's Calories:**
  - \(46 \times 200 = 9000\) calories.

- **Sister's Calories:**
  - \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

### **Step 4: Find the Difference in Calories**

- **Difference:** \(9000 - 3600 = 5400\) calories.

\(\boxed{5400}\)
