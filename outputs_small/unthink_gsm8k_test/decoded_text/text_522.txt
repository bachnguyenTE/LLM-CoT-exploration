Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of quarts of strawberries picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy.

1. **Tony's Rate:**
   - **Tony** can pick **6 quarts per hour**.

2. **Bobby's Rate:**
   - **Bobby** picks **1 quart less** than **Tony**.
   - **Bobby's rate = 6 quarts/hour - 1 quart/hour = 5 quarts/hour**.

3. **Kathy's Rate:**
   - **Kathy** picks **twice as many** as **Bobby**.
   - **Kathy's rate = 2 × 5 quarts/hour = 10 quarts/hour**.

4. **Ricky's Rate:**
   - **Ricky** picks **2 quarts less** than **Kathy**.
   - **Ricky's rate = 10 quarts/hour - 2 quarts/hour = 8 quarts/hour**.

5. **Total Rate:**
   - **Total = Tony + Bobby + Kathy + Ricky**
   - **Total = 6 quarts/hour + 5 quarts/hour + 10 quarts/hour + 8 quarts/hour**
   - **Total = 29 quarts/hour**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{29}
