**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the length of Movie A in minutes.
   - Let \( B \) be the length of Movie B in minutes.
   - Let \( C \) be the length of Movie C in minutes.

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{4}B
     \]
   - Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:
     \[
     B = C + 5
     \]
   - Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes:
     \[
     C = 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Find the Length of Movie B:**
   - Substitute \( C = 75 \) minutes into \( B = C + 5 \):
     \[
     B = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Find the Length of Movie A:**
   - Substitute \( B = 80 \) minutes into \( A = \frac{1}{4}B \):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 22 \text{ minutes}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
