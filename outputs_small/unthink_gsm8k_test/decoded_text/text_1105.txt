Q: Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for her retirement, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Current annual salary:** \$100,000
- **Retirement period desired:** 20 years
- **Current savings rate:** 20%
- **Salary reduction needed for retirement:** 40%

### **Step 1: Calculate the Required Salary for Retirement**
Lauren wants to live with 40% of her current salary in retirement.

\[
\text{Retirement salary} = 40\% \times \$100,000 = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
\]

### **Step 2: Determine the Additional Salary Needed**
Lauren currently saves 20% of her salary. To find out how much more she needs to save each year, subtract her current savings rate from the desired retirement savings rate.

\[
\text{Additional savings rate} = 20\% - 40\% = -20\%
\]

Wait, this calculation doesn't make sense because subtracting 40% from 20% results in a negative number, which would imply she needs to save more than her current savings rate. This suggests that Lauren needs to increase her savings rate to 40% to meet her retirement salary goal.

### **Step 3: Calculate the Required Savings**
Lauren needs to save \$40,000 per year at a 20% savings rate.

\[
\text{Required annual savings} = \$40,000 \times 20\% = \$8,000
\]

### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Years Needed**
Lauren currently saves 20% of her salary, which is:

\[
\text{Current annual savings} = \$100,000 \times 20\% = \$20,000
\]

To save the additional \$8,000 per year, we'll divide the required annual savings by her current annual savings.

\[
\text{Years needed} = \frac{\$8,000}{\$20,000} = 0.4 \text{ years}
\]

Since 0.4 of a year is approximately 4.8 months, Lauren needs to work for **4 years and 9 months** more to save for her retirement.

\[
\boxed{4 \text{ years and 9 months}}
\]
