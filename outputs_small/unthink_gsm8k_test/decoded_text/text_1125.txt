**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total weight of the large bags:**
   
   - Each large bag weighs **10 ounces**.
   - John buys **3 large bags**.
   - **Total weight of large bags** = \( 3 \times 10 \, \text{ounces} = 30 \, \text{ounces} \).

2. **Find the number of M&M in each large bag:**
   
   - Each ounce contains **30 M&M**.
   - **M&M in one large bag** = \( 30 \,000 \times 30 = 900,00 \,00 \, \text{M&M} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of M&M John has:**
   
   - **Total M&M** = \( 3 \times 900,00 \,00 = 270,000 \, \text{M&M} \).

4. **Determine the number of small bags he can make:**
   
   - Each small bag holds **10 M&M**.
   - **Number of small bags** = \( \frac{270,00}{10} = 270 \,00 \,0 \,0 \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{27000}
\]
