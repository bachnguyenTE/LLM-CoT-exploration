**Solution:**

Let's break down Bud's expenses for making macaroni and cheese in a year.

1. **Pasta Cost:**
   - Bud buys 1 box of pasta per week.
   - **Cost per box:** \$1.00
   - **Weekly pasta cost:** \$1.00
   - **Annual pasta cost:** 52 weeks × \$1.00 = **\$52.00**

2. **Cheddar Cheese Cost:**
   - Bud spends **\$3.00** on cheddar cheese.
   - **Cheddar cost:** \$3.00
   - **Annual cheddar cost:** \$3.00 (since he buys it once a week)

3. **Gruyere Cheese Cost:**
   - Bud spends **twice the amount** on gruyere cheese compared to cheddar.
   - **Gruyere cost:** 2 × \$3.00 = **\$6.00**
   - **Annual gruyere cost:** \$6.00

4. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - **Pasta:** \$52.00
   - **Cheddar:** \$3.00
   - **Gruyere:** \$6.00
   - **Total:** \$52.00 + \$3.00 + \$6.00 = **\$61.50**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{61.50}
