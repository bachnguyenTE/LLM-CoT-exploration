To determine how many miles Sam ran this week, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Sam's Running Schedule:**
   - **Monday:** 3 miles
   - **Tuesday:** 5 miles
   - **Wednesday:** 3 miles
   - **Thursday:** 5 miles
   - **Friday:** 3 miles

2. **Calculate Total Miles:**
   - **Miles on Monday:** 3 miles
   - **Miles on Tuesday:** 5 miles
   - **Miles on Wednesday:** 3 miles
   - **Miles on Thursday:** 5 miles
   - **Miles on Friday:** 3 miles

   Adding them all together:
   \[
   3 \, 5, 3, 5, 3
   \]
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 + 5 = 16
   \]
   \[
   16 + 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{9}
   \]

So, Sam ran a total of **9 miles** this week.
