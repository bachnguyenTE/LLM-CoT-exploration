To determine how many hours each painter worked, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Days Worked:**
   - The team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day every day.
   - They worked for 3 weeks.

   First, find the total number of days:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total number of days they worked:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} = 7 \frac{7}{8} \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Convert Days to Hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.

   Convert the total days to hours:
   \[
   7 \frac{7}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = 63 \times 3 = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Distribute Hours Among Painters:**
   - There are 4 painters.

   Divide the total hours by the number of painters:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours per painter}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{47.25 \text{ hours}}
\]
