Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

1. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - John had a son James when he was 19.
   - Let \( J \) be John's current age.
   - Therefore, James's current age is \( J - 19 \).

2. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
   - Let \( D \) be Dora's current age.
   - So, \( J - 19 = 2D \).
   - Solving for \( D \): \( D = \frac{J - 19}{2} \).

3. **Determine Dora's Age in 3 Years:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora's current age is \( 12 - 3 = 9 \).
   - So, \( D = 9 \).

4. **Find John's Current Age:**
   - From step 2: \( 9 = \frac{J - 19}{2} \).
   - Multiply both sides by 2: \( 18 = J - 19 \).
   - Add 19 to both sides: \( J = 37 \).
   - John is currently 37 years old.

5. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Therefore, the youngest son is currently \( 37 - 32 = 5 \) years old.

6. **Determine the Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) years old.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{8}\)
