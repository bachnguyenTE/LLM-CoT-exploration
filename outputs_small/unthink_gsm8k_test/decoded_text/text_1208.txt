**Solution:**

To determine Trinity's profit, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Selling Price:**
   
   Trinity sells magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. This means:
   
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   
   Given that the **Cost Price** is \$72, we can calculate the **Selling Price** as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the Profit:**
   
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the **Cost Price** from the **Selling Price**:
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \left( \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \right) - 72
   \]
   
3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   
   First, calculate \( \frac{1}{8} \times 72 \):
   
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 72 = 9
   \]
   
   Now, subtract the **Cost Price**:
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 9 - 72 = -63
   \]
   
   **Note:** A negative profit indicates a **loss**.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{-63}
\]
