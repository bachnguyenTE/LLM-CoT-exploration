To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Daily production of Hortex:** 4200 bottles per day.
   - **Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.**
   - **Number of people:** 2300.

2. **Calculate the Total Energy Demand for 2300 People:**
   
   Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy, to cover 100% of the energy demand, Hortex needs to produce:
   
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles per person}
   \]
   
   Therefore, for 2300 people:
   
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Determine the Additional Bottles Needed:**
   
   Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed:
   
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]
