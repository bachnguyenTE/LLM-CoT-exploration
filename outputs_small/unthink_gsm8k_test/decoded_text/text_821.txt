Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - **First Morning:** Hunter counted **50 cars** in the parking lot.

2. **First Break:**
   - **Counted More Cars:** During the first break, he counted **20 more cars**.
   - **Total After First Break:** 
     \[
     50 \text{ cars} + 20 \text{ cars} = 70 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Lunch Break:**
   - **Cars That Went:** When he got out of class for lunch, he realized that **1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone**.
   - **Cars Remaining After Lunch:**
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 70 \text{ cars} = 35 \text{ cars}
     \]
   - **Cars Counted During Lunch:** 
     \[
     70 \text{ cars} - 35 \text{ cars} = 35 \text{ cars}
     \]

4. **Total Cars Counted During Lunch Break:**
   - **Cars Counted During Lunch:** 35 cars
   - **Cars Counted Before Lunch:** 50 cars
   - **Total Cars Counted:** 
     \[
     50 \text{ cars} + 35 \text{ cars} = 85 \text{ cars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{85}
\]
