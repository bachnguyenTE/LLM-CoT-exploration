To determine the total amount the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we'll calculate the cost for each type of ad separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost for Newspaper Ads:**
   - **Number of Newspaper Ads:** 50
   - **Cost per Newspaper Ad:** \$5
   - **Total Cost for Newspaper Ads:** \( 50 \times \$5 = \$250 \)

2. **Cost for Television Ads:**
   - **Number of Television Ads:** 15
   - **Cost per Television Ad:** \$75
   - **Total Cost for Television Ads:** \( 15 \times \$75 = \$1,125 \)

3. **Total Cost for All Ads:**
   - **Total Cost:** \( \$250 + \$1,125 = \$1,375 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{\$1,375}\)
