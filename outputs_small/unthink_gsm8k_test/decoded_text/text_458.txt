To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, follow these steps:

1. **Find the total number of puppies:**
   - Jennifer's dog has **8 puppies**.
   - Brandon's dog has **12 puppies**.
   - **Total puppies = 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.**

2. **Find the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jennifer's dog has **3 puppies with spots**.
   - Brandon's dog has **4 puppies with spots**.
   - **Total spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.**

3. **Calculate the percentage of of spotted puppies:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total spotted puppies}}{\text{Total puppies}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 35\%
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{35\%}\)
