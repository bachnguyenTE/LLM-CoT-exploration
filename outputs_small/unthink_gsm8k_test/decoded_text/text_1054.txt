**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   
   - Each tile covers an area of \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - Total area of the kitchen floor is \(200 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - Number of tiles needed = Total area / Area per tile = \(200 \text{ SqFt} / 1 \text{ SqFt} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   - Each tile costs \$12.
   - Total cost = Number of tiles × Cost per tile = \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2,400\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$2,\!400}
\]
