**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Elvis has a **monthly saving target** of **\$1125**.
   - In **April**, he wants to save **twice as much daily** in the **second half** of the month compared to the **first half**.
   - We need to find out how much Elvis has to save **each day** in the **second half** of the month.

2. **Defining Variables:**
   - Let **\( x \)** be the amount Elvis saves **each day** in the **first half** of April.
   - Therefore, he saves **\( 2x \)** each day in the **second half**.

3. **Calculating Total Savings:**
   - **First Half of April:** There are **15 days** in the first half (assuming April has 30 days).
     - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \).
   - **Second Half of April:** There are **25 days** in the second half.
     - Total savings in the second half: \( 25 \times 2x = 50x \).

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total savings for the month should be **\$1125**.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     15x + 50x = 1125
     \]
     \[
     65x = 1125
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{65} = 1.73076923 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - To make it more understandable, we can round it to two decimal places:
     \[
     x \approx 1.73 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating Savings for the Second Half:**
   - Savings per day in the second half:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 1.73 = 3.46 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3.46}
\]
