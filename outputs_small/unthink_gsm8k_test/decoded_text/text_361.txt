Q: A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: This is **50 miles less than the combined distance to go from the second city to the first city**.

   So, the combined distance from the second city to the first city is:
   \[
   75 \text{ miles} + 100 \text{ miles} = 175 \text{ miles}
   \]
   
   Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
   \[
   175 \text{ miles} - 50 \text{ miles} = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one trip:**
   
   - Distance from first to second city: 75 miles
   - Distance from second to third city: 100 miles
   - Distance from third to first city: 125 miles
   
   Total distance for one trip:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 125 = 310 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the total distance for 3 trips:**
   
   \[
   310 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips} = 930 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of days the train will go between services:**
   
   The train needs service every **18,000 miles**.
   
   Number of days:
   \[
   \frac{930 \text{ miles}}{18,000 \text{ miles/day}} = 0.051666\ldots \text{ days}
   \]
   
   Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number.

   Therefore, the train will go between services for **1 day**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
