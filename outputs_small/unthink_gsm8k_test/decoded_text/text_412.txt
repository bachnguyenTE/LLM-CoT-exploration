To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies needed:**
   - Shannon eats **2 cookies** per night.
   - She wants to last herself **30 days**.
   - **Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night × 30 days = 60 cookies.**

2. **Determine how many dozens are needed:**
   - Each **doz** contains **12 cookies**.
   - **Number of dozens = 60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/doz = 5 dozens.**

**Final Answer:** Shannon needs to make **5 dozens** of cookies.
