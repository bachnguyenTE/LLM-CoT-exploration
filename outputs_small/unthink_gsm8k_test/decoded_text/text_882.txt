Q: Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly’s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?

To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of each item:**
   - **Bacon:** 5 packs cost \$10.
   - **Chicken:** Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. 
     \[
     \text{Cost per chicken packet} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
     \]
   - **Strawberries:** 3 packs cost \$4 each.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times \$4 = \$12
     \]
   - **Apples:** Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
     \[
     \text{Cost per apple pack} = \frac{\$4}{2} = \$2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for apples} = 7 \times \$2 = \$14
     \]

2. **Sum up all the costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$10 (\text{bacon}) + \$200 (\text{chicken}) + \$12 (\text{strawberries}) + \$14 (\text{apples}) = \$246
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$65 - \$246 = -\$181
   \]
   
   **Note:** The negative value indicates that Kelly overspent by \$181.

\boxed{-181}
