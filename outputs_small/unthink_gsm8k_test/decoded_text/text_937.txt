**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the hay needed per goat:**
   - Each goat needs **5 pounds** of hay.

2. **Calculate the hay needed per sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs **3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.**
   - First, find twice the amount for a goat: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) pounds.
   - Then, subtract 3 pounds: \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) pounds.
   - So, each sheep needs **7 pounds** of hay.

3. **Calculate the total hay needed for all goats:**
   - There are **15 goats**.
   - Total for goats: \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total hay needed for all sheep:**
   - There are **12 sheep**.
   - Total for sheep: \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \) pounds.

5. **Find the total hay needed for all livestock:**
   - Total hay = Total for goats + Total for sheep
   - Total hay = \( 75 + 84 = 159 \) pounds.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{159}
