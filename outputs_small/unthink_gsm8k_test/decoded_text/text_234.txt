**Solution:**

1. **Determine Steve's daily tomato consumption:**
   
   Steve eats **6 tomatoes per day**.

2. **Calculate the weekly tomato consumption:**
   
   \[
   6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Find out how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week:**
   
   Each vine produces **3 tomatoes per week**.

4. **Determine the number of vines needed:**
   
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
