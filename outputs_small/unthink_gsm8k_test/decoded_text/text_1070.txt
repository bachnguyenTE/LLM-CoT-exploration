**Solution:**

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed:**
   - Dennis needs to make **6 dozen croissants**.
   - For every **1 dozen croissants**, he uses **1 pound of butter**.
   - **Total butter needed = 6 dozen × 1 pound/douz = 6 pounds**.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   - **Promotion:** Buy 1 pound, get 0.5 pounds for half price.
   - **Total butter needed = 6 pounds**.

3. **Calculate the cost using the promotion:**
   - **First pound:** Full price.
   - **Next 0.5 pounds:** Half price.
   - **Total cost for 1.5 pounds = (1 × $4.00) + (0.5 × $2.00) = $4.00 + $1.00 = $5.00**.

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds:**
   - **Number of sets of 1.5 pounds in 6 pounds = 6 ÷ 1.5 = 4 sets.**
   - **Total cost = 4 sets × $5.0 = $20.0**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$20.00}
