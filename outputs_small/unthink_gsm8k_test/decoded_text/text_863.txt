Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Gretchen has some coins.
- There are **30 more gold coins** than silver coins.
- If she had **70 gold coins**, how many coins did Gretchen have in total?

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

**From the problem:**
1. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]
2. If she had **70 gold coins**, then:
   \[
   G = 70
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute \( G = 70 \) into the first equation.
\[
70 = S + 30
\]

**Step2:** Solve for \( S \).
\[
S = 70 - 30 = 40
\]

**Step3:** Calculate the total number of coins.
\[
\text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{110}
\]
