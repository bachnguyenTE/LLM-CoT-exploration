**Solution:**

Elvira has a total budget of €1500. She purchases the following items:

1. **Computer with screen, keyboard, and mouse:** €1090
2. **Scanner:** €157
3. **CD burner:** €74
4. **Printer:** €102

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost of the purchased items.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 = 1247
\]

\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]

\[
1321 + 102 = 1423
\]

**Step 2:** Subtract the total cost from the budget to find out how much money Elvira has left for clothing.

\[
\text{Money Left} = 1500 - 1423 = 77
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{77}
\]
