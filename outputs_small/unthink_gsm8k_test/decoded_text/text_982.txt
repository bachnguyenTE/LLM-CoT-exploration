Q: In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?

To determine how many students are leaving early, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Students:**
   \[
   30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Football Players:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students}
   \]

3. **Remaining Students After Football Players:**
   \[
   30 - 6 = 27 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Cheerleaders or Band Members:**
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 27 = 0.25 \times 27 = 6.75
   \]
   Since the number of students must be a whole number, we'll consider this as **7 students** (assuming rounding up).

5. **Total Students Leaving Early:**
   \[
   6 \text{ (Football Players)} + 7 \text{ (Cheerleaders or Band)} = 13 \text{ students}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
