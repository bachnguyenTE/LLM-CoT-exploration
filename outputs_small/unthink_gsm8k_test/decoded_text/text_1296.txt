**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Ellen and Lani spent together, we'll calculate the cost for each person and then add them together.

1. **Ellen's Purchase:**
   - **Leggings:** \$100
   - **Photo Frame:** \$5
   - **Total for Ellen:** \$100 + \$5 = **\$105**

2. **Lani's Purchase:**
   - **Sunglasses:** \$30
   - **Bathrobes:** 2 × \$100 = **\$200**
   - **Total for Lani:** \$30 + \$200 = **\$230**

3. **Combined Total:**
   - **Ellen:** \$105
   - **Lani:** \$230
   - **Total Spent:** \$105 + \$230 = **\$335**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{335}\)
