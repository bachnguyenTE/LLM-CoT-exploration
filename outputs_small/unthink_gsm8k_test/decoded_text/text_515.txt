**Solution:**

To determine Tara's profit from selling the canvas bags, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of purchasing the canvas bags:**
   
   Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags at $4 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4/\text{pack} = \$32
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:**
   
   Tara sold 8 canvas bags at $8 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 8 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$64
   \]

3. **Determine the profit:**
   
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$64 - \$32 = \$32
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$32}
\]
