Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total number of animals:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
   - Total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4k = 70
     \]
     (Since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs.)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( k \):
     \[
     c = 20 - k
     \]
   - Substitute \( c \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(20 - k) + 4k = 70
     \]
     \[
     40 - 2k + 4k = 70
     \]
     \[
     40 + 2k = 70
     \]
     \[
     2k = 70 - 40
     \]
     \[
     2k = 30
     \]
     \[
     k = 15
     \]
   - Now, find \( c \):
     \[
     c = 20 - 15 = 5
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - There are **5 chickens** on Farmer Brown's farm.
