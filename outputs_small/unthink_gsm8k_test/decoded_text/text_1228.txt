**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
   - Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.
   - Samantha has 27 paintings.

2. **Let’s define variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.
   - Let \( Sh \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.

3. **From the problem:**
   - \( S = 27 \) (Samantha has 27 paintings).
   - \( Sh = S + 12 \) (Samantha has 12 fewer than Shelley).
   - \( Sh = K + 8 \) (Shelley has 8 more than Kim).

4. **Substitute \( S \) into the second equation:**
   \[
   Sh = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   
5. **Now, substitute \( Sh \) into the third equation to find \( K \):**
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]
   \[
   K = 39 - 8 = 21
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{21}
   \]
