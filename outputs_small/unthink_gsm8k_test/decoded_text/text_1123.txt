To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Kory’s Dog Weight:**
   - Kory’s dog weighs **60 pounds**.

2. **Elijah’s Dogs:**
   - **First Dog:** One-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog.
     - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) pounds.
   - **Second Dog:** Half the weight of Kory’s dog.
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times60 = 30 \) pounds.

3. **Total Weight of Elijah’s Dogs:**
   - \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) pounds.

4. **Total Weight of Both Dogs:**
   - Kory’s dog: 60 pounds
   - Elijah’s dogs: 45 pounds
   - **Total:** \( 60 + 45 = 105 \) pounds.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{105}\) pounds
