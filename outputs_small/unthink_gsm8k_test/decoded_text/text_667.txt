**Solution:**

Sarah's basketball game consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. The game was extended by 5 minutes in the last quarter. To find the total duration of the game, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time for the first 3 quarters:**
   \[
   3 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes/quarter} = 36 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Add the time for the last quarter:**
   \[
   36 \text{ minutes} + 12 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Add the extension to the last quarter:**
   \[
   48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{53 \text{ minutes}}
\]
