To determine how many people are infected after three days, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Day 0:**
- **Initial Infection:** 1 person is infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each infected person infects 6 others.
- **New Infections:** \(1 \times 6 = 6\) people.
- **Total Infected:** \(1 + 6 = 7\) people.

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 7 infected people infects 6 others.
- **New Infections:** \(7 \times 6 = 42\) people.
- **Total Infected:** \(7 + 42 = 49\) people.

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 49 infected people infects 6 others.
- **New Infections:** \(49 \times 6 = 294\) people.
- **Total Infected:** \(49 + 294 = 343\) people.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{343}
\]
