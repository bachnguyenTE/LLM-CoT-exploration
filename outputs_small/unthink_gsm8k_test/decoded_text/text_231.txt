Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- On **Monday**, Robert collects **20 shells**.
- Kylie collects **5 more shells** than Robert on **Monday**.
- On **Tuesday**, Kylie collects **2 times more** shells than she did on **Monday**.

**Step 1: Determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday.**

Since Kylie collects **5 more shells** than Robert on Monday:
\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells on Monday} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.**

Kylie collects **2 times more** shells on Tuesday than on Monday. This means:
\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ shells}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
