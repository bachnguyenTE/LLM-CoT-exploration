A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Adam's Purchase:**
   - Adam bought himself new trousers for **\$30**.

2. **Father's Contribution:**
   - His father gave him **twice as much** as his mother.
   - Let’s denote the amount given by his mother as \( x \).
   - Therefore, the father gave him \( 2x \).

3. **Total Amount Received:**
   - The total amount Adam received from his parents is:
     \[
     30 + x + 2x = 30 + 3x
     \]
   - However, the problem doesn't specify how much his mother gave him individually, only that he received **\$6** from his mother.

4. **Substituting the Value:**
   - Since his mother gave him **\$6**, we have:
     \[
     x = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the father gave him:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

5. **Total Contribution:**
   - Adding up all the contributions:
     \[
     30 \, (\text{trouses}) + 6 \, (\text{mother}) + 12 \, \text{fathers} = 54
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{54}
\]
