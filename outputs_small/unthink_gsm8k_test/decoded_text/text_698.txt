**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account:**
   
   Greta's total paycheck is \$2400.00.
   
   \[
   \text{Retirement Contribution} = 50\% \times \$2400.0 = 0.50 \times 2400.00 = \$1200.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount Greta uses for her monthly car payment:**
   
   Greta spends 20% of her paycheck on her car payment.
   
   \[
   \text{Car Payment} = 20\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.20 \times 2400.0 = \$480.00
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount spent (retirement and car payments):**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Expenditure} = \$1200.00 + \$480.00 = \$1680.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining amount Greta has to spend:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \$2400.00 - \$1680.00 = \$720.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$720.000}
\]
