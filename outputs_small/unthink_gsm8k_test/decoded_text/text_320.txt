Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- At the beginning of the party:
  - Number of men = 25
  - Number of women = 15
- Total number of people at the beginning = 25 + 15 = 40
- After an hour:
  - 1/4 of the total number of people left the party
  - Number of men who stayed = 22

**Find:**
- Number of women who stayed at the party

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of people who left the party:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total people left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. **Determine the number of women who left the party:**
   
   - Total people left = 10
   - Number of men who left = 25 (since all men left)
   - Therefore, number of women who left = 10 - 5 = 5

3. **Calculate the number of women who stayed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Women who stayed} = \text{Total women} - \text{Women who left} = 15 - 5 = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
