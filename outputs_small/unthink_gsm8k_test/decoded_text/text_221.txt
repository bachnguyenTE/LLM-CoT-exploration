Q: A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total water in the tank: 120 liters
- Water used for the garden: 90 liters

**Step 1: Calculate the remaining water after watering the garden.**
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \text{Total water} - \text{Water used} = 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 22 \text{ liters}
\]

**Step2: Calculate the collected rainwater.**
\[
\text{Collected rainwater} = 2 \times \text{Remaining water} = 2 \times 22 \text{ liters} = 44 \text{ liters}
\]

**Step3: Calculate the total water in the tank now.**
\[
\text{Total water now} = \text{Remaining water} + \text{Collected rainwater} = 22 \text{ liters} + 44 \text{ liters} = 66 \text{ liters}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{66 \text{ liters}}
\]
