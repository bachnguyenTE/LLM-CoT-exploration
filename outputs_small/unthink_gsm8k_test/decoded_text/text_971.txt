To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Garden:**
   - The garden is rectangular with a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet.
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15\text{ ft} + 10\text{ ft}) = 2 \times 15\text{ ft} = 30\text{ ft}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Wood Slats Needed:**
   - Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing.
   - Multiply the total perimeter by the number of slats per foot:
     \[
     \text{Total Slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 30\text{ ft} = 60\text{ slats}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
