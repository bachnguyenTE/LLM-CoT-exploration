**Solution:**

John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Each pair of shoes costs \$60.

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes:**

   2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$360}
