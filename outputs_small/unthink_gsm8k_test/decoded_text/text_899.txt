**Solution:**

Susan made **100 cookies** and wanted to **equally divide them** among her **6 nephews**. However, her husband **snuck in 4 cookies** for himself before she could package them. We need to determine how many cookies each nephew will get.

1. **Total Cookies Initially:**
   \[
   100 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies Snuck by Husband:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies Left for Susan:**
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Cookies Each Nephew Gets:**
   \[
   \frac{96}{6} = 16 \text{ cookies per nephew}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
