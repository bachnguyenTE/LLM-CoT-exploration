To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Floors:** The building has **15 floors**.

2. **Units per Floor:** Each floor contains **8 units**.

3. **Total Units in the Building:** 
   \[
   \text{Total Units} = \text{Total Floors} \times \text{Units per Floor} = 15 \times 8 = 120 \text{ units}
   \]

4. **Occupied Units:** 
   \[
   \text{Occupied Units} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the building} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Unoccupied Units:** 
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied Units} = \text{Total Units} - \text{Occupied Units} = 120 - 90 = 27 \text{ units}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{27}\)
