To determine how many kilograms of dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Number of German Shepherds:** 3
- **Number of Bulldogs:** 2
- **Daily consumption:**
  - **German Shepherd:** 5 kilograms
  - **Bulldog:** 3 kilograms

**Step 1: Calculate the daily food consumption for each type of dog.**

1. **German Shepherds:**
   \[
   3 \text{ dogs} \times 5 \text{ kg/dog} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
   \]
   
2. **Bulldogs:**
   \[
   2 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/dog} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total daily food consumption for all dogs.**

\[
15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly food consumption.**

\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg/week}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{147 \text{ kilograms}}
\]
