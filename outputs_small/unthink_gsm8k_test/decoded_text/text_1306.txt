Q: Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many beakers Igor lost.

**Given:**
- **Required items:**
  - Test tubes: 16
  - Beakers: 7
  - Petri dishes: 14
- **Actual items gathered:**
  - Test tubes: Half as many as requested → \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
  - Petri dishes: Two more than requested → \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
  - Beakers: Correct number (7) but lost some on the way
- **Total items placed on the bench:** 29

**Let’s denote:**
- \( x \) = Number of beakers lost

**Total items Igor placed on the bench:**
\[
\text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes} = 29
\]
\[
8 + 7 + 16 = 21
\]
Wait, that doesn't add up to 29. Let's correct that.

**Correct calculation:**
\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
\]
\[
8 + 7 + 16 = 21
\]
But the total is supposed to be 29. This indicates that Igor lost some beakers, which reduces the total.

**Let’s adjust the equation:**
\[
8 + 7 + 16 = 21
\]
But Igor lost \( x \) beakers, so:
\[
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
\]
\[
21 - x = 29
\]
\[
-x = 29 - 21
\]
\[
-x = -2
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

**Conclusion:**
Igor lost **2 beakers** on the way to the lab bench.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
