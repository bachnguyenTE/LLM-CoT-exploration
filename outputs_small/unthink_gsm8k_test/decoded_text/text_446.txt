**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs:**
   - **Case:** 4 dozen eggs = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs
   - **Cupboard:** 2 eggs
   - **Total eggs available:** \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs

2. **Eggs per Glass:**
   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.

3. **Total Glasses:**
   - Total eggs divided by eggs per glass: \(\frac{50}{5} = 10\) glasses

4. **Eggs per trays:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses.
   - Total eggs per tray: \(5 \times 5 = 25\) eggs

5. **Number of trays:**
   - Total eggs available: 50
   - Eggs per tray: 25
   - Number of trays: \(\frac{50}{25} = 2\) trays

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{2}\) trays
