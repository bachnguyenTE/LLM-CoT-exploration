Q: Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Jay can build **20 snowballs** in an hour.
- **2 snowballs** melt every **15 minutes**.

**Objective:**
- Determine how **long** it will take Jay to have **60 snowballs**.

**Step 1: Understand the Rates**

First, let's find out the rates at which Jay builds and melts snowballs.

- **Building Rate:**
  - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 60 minutes (1 hour).
  - Therefore, his building rate is:
    \[
    \text{Building Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
    \]

- **Melting Rate:**
  - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
  - Therefore, the number of 15-minute intervals in 60 minutes is:
    \[
    \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 12 \text{ intervals}
    \]
  - So, the total number of snowballs melted in 1 hour is:
    \[
    2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 12 \text{ intervals} = 24 \text{ snowballs}
    \]
  - Therefore, the melting rate is:
    \[
    \text{Melting Rate} = \frac{24 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
    \]

**Step 2: Net Gain per Minute**

To find out how many snowballs Jay effectively gains per minute, subtract the melting rate from the building rate:

\[
\text{Net Gain} = \text{Building Rate} - \text{Melting Rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{5}
\]

To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}, \quad \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{15} = \frac{18}{15}
\]
Wait, that's not correct. Let me correct that.

Actually, to subtract \(\frac{2}{5}\) from \(\frac{1}{3}\), let's convert them to have a common denominator of of 15:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}, \quad \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{15}
\]
So,

\[
\text{Net Gain} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{6}{15} = -\frac{1}{15} \text{ snowballs per minute}
\]

This negative value indicates that Jay is actually losing snowballs over time.

**Step 3: Determine the Time to Reach 60 Snowballs**

Let’s denote:
- \( t \) as the time in minutes required to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay starts with 0 snowballs (assuming he starts with an empty pile). The number of snowballs he has after \( t \) minutes can be modeled by:

\[
\text{Number of Snowballs} = \text{Building Rate} \times t - \text{Melting Rate} \times t
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
60 = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times t \right) - \left( \frac{2}{5} \times t \right)
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
60 = \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{5} \right) t
\]

Find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}, \quad \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{15} = \frac{18}{15}
\]
Wait, that's not correct. Let's correctly subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{6}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{6}{15} = -\frac{1}{15}
\]

So,

\[
60 = -\frac{1}{15} t
\]

This implies:

\[
t = 60 \times (-15) = -900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Wait, that doesn't make sense
