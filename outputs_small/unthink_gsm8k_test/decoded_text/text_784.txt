Q: Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG (miles per gallon). If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much money is Andy's car consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the one-way distance:**
   - One-way distance = 5 miles.

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip = 2 × 5 miles = 10 miles.

3. **Calculate the total miles driven in a week:**
   - He works Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - Total miles = 10 miles/day × 5 days = 50 miles.

4. **Determine the fuel efficiency:**
   - Fuel efficiency = 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

5. **Calculate the total gallons of gas used:**
   - Gallons used = Total miles / Fuel efficiency = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons.

6. **Calculate the total cost of gas:**
   - Cost per gallon = \$3.
   - Total cost = 5 gallons × \$3/gallon = \$15.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$15}
