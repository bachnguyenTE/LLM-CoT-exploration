**Solution:**

Let's analyze both breakfast options to determine the weight difference after 5 weeks.

1. **Eating Cheerios Every Day:**
   - **Gain per week:** -1.25 pounds
   - **Gain per day:** \(-1.25 \div 7 = -0.1786\) pounds

2. **Eating Donuts Every Day:**
   - **Gain per week:** +1.75 pounds
   - **Gain per day:** \(1.75 \div 7 = 0.25\) pounds

3. **Total Weight Gain After 5 Weeks:**
   - **For Cheerios:**
     \[
     -1.25 \times 5 = -6.25 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - **For Donuts:**
     \[
     1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Difference in Weight Gain:**
   \[
   8.75 - (-6.25) = 8.75 + 6.25 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
