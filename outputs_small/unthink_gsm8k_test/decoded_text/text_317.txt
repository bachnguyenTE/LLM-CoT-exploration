To determine the cost of filling the pool, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6\,04 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost to fill the pool:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 = \$12
   \]

**Final Answer:** \boxed{\$12}
