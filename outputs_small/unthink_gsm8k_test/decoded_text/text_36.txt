A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Terry's daily yogurt consumption:**
   
   Terry eats **2** yogurts per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Yogurts} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

3. **Understand the sale price:**
   
   - **Sale:** 4 yogurts for **\$5.00**.
   - **Current Price:** Not specified, but we can assume it's the regular price.

4. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs for 60 yogurt:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$75.00}
\]
