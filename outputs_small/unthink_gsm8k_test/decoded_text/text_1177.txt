To determine how many students are not on varsity, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Total Students:**
- Boys: 12
- Girls: 12
- **Total = 12 + 12 = 24 students**

**Girls onVarsity:**
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.
- **Girls onVarsity = (1/3) × 12 = 4 girls**

**Boys onVarsity:**
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
- **Boys onVarsity = (1/4) ×12 = 3 boys**

**Total onVarsity:**
- **Total onVarsity = 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students**

**Students not onVarsity:**
- **Total students - Total onVarsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{17}
