Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Denise's reading:**
  - Yesterday: 10 pages
  - Today: 5 pages more than Daniel read yesterday
- **Daniel's reading:**
  - Yesterday: 13 pages
  - Today: 0 pages

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Daniel read today.**
\[
\text{Daniel today} = 0 \text{ pages}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Denise read today.**
\[
\text{Denise today} = \text{Daniel yesterday} + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days.**

- **Denise's total:**
\[
\text{Total} = \text{Yesterday} + \text{Today} = 10 + 18 = 28 \text{ pages}
\]

- **Daniel's total:**
\[
\text{Total} = \text{Yesterday} + \text{Today} = 13 + 0 = 13 \text{ pages}
\]

**Step 4: Determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.**
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Denise's total} - \text{Daniel's total} = 28 - 13 = 15 \text{ pages}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
