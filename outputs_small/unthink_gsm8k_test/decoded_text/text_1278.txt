To determine the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny together, follow these steps:

1. **Add the total number of seashells found by all three individuals:**
   \[
   214 \ (\text{Tom}) + 432 \ (\text{Nancy}) + 86 \ (\text{Benny}) = 732
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:**
   \[
   732 \ (\text{total seashells}) - 67 \ (\text{cracked seashells}) = 665
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{665}\)
