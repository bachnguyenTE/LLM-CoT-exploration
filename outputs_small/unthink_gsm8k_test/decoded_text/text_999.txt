To determine what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total family members:** 6 (2 adults and 4 kids)
- **Watermelon division:** Each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid.

**Step 1: Assign Variables**
Let’s assume:
- Let \( x \) be the size of a kid's slice.
- Then, the size of an adult's slice is \( 2x \).

**Step 2: Calculate Total Slices**
- **Kids:** 4 kids × \( x \) = \( 4x \)
- **Adults:** 2 adults × \( 2x \) = \( 4x \)
- **Total slices:** \( 4x + 4x = 8x \)

**Step 3: Determine Each Adult's Share**
Since there are 2 adults, each adult gets:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} = 2x
\]

**Step 4: Calculate Percentage**
To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25\%}
\]
