**Solution:**

To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - **Aluminum Cans:** 
     - Each can is worth **2 cents**.
     - Grayson drinks **3 cans** a week.
     - **Total from cans:** \( 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \).
   - **Plastic Bottles:**
     - Each bottle is worth **3 cents**.
     - Grayson drinks **5 bottles** a week.
     - **Total from bottles:** \( 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \).
   
   - **Total weekly earnings:** \( 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \).

2. **Calculate for a four-week month:**
   - **Total monthly earnings:** \( 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \).

**Final Answer:** Grayson earns **84 cents** from recycling in a four-week month.
