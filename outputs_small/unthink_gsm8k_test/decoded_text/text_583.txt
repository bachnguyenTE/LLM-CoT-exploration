Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the number of cups Judy brought.**

Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen equals 12, Judy brought:
\[
12 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of dishes Judy brought.**

Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, the number of dishes she brought is:
\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cups and dishes Judy brought.**

Total items Judy brought:
\[
12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ items}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the number of cups and dishes her friend brought.**

Her friend brought:
- **Cups:** 40 cups
- **Dishes:** 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought:
\[
24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.**

Total items brought by both:
\[
\text{Judy's items} + \text{Friend's items} = 36 + 44 = 80 \text{ items}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{80}
\]
