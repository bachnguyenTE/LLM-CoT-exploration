**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Glasses Sold:**
   - Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of **32 glasses** of lemonade.

2. **Glasses Sold by Julie:**
   - Julie sold **14 glasses** of lemonade.

3. **Equal Number of Glasses Sold by the Boys:**
   - The problem states that the boys (Julie, Micah, and Mitchell) sold an **equal number of glasses**. This means that each boy sold the same number of glasses.

4. **Determine the Number of Glasses Sold by Each Boy:**
   - Since there are three boys and they sold a total of 32 glasses, we can find out how many glasses each boy sold by dividing the total by 3.
   - **Glasses per boy = Total glasses / Number of boys = 32 / 3 ≈ 10.6666...**

   However, since the number of glasses sold must be a whole number, there seems to be a discrepancy here. Let's re-examine the problem.

5. **Re-examining the Problem:**
   - The problem states that Julie sold **14 glasses**, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. It does not explicitly mention that the total number of glasses sold by all three boys is 32. This could be a point of confusion.

6. **Clarifying the Total:**
   - If Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys (including Julie) sold an equal number of glasses, we need to clarify whether the total includes only the boys or all three individuals.

   - **Assuming the total includes all three individuals:**
     - Let’s denote:
       - \( J \) = Glasses sold by Julie
       - \( M \) = Glasses sold by Micah
       - \( H \) = Glasses sold by Mitchell

     - Given:
       - \( J = 14 \)
       - \( J = M = H \) (since they sold an equal number)

     - Total glasses sold:
       - \( J + M + H = 32 \)

     - Substituting \( J = 14 \):
       - \( 14 + M + H = 32 \)
       - \( M + H = 32 - 14 = 18 \)

     - Since \( M = H \), we have:
       - \( 2M = 18 \)
       - \( M = 9 \)

7. **Calculating How Many More Glasses Julie Sold Than Micah:**
   - Julie sold **14 glasses**.
   - Micah sold **9 glasses**.
   - Difference = \( 14 - 9 = 5 \) glasses.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{5}
