**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students:**
   - Each class has an average of **25 students**.
   - There are **40 classes**.
   - **Total students = 25 students/class × 40 classes = 200 students.**

2. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   - Each class has an average of **3 teachers**.
   - There are **40 classes**.
   - **Total teachers = 3 teachers/class × 40 classes = 120 teachers.**

3. **Calculate the number of trees planted by students:**
   - Each student plants **1 tree**.
   - **Total trees by students = 200 students × 1 tree/student = 200 trees.**

4. **Calculate the number of trees planted by teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants **2 trees**.
   - **Total trees by teachers = 120 teachers × 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.**

5. **Calculate the total number of trees planted:**
   - **Total trees = Trees by students + Trees by teachers = 220 trees + 240 trees = 462 trees.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{462}
