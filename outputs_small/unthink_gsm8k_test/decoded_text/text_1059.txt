**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats each day:**
   
   - Imma has **3 cats**.
   - She feeds each cat **2 times a day**.
   - Each feeding uses **60 grams of cat food**.

   So, the total daily cat food consumption is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cats} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} \times 60 \text{ grams/feeding} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:**
   
   - Total cat food available: **720 grams**
   - Daily consumption: **360 grams/day**

   The number of days the cat food will last is:
   \[
   \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
