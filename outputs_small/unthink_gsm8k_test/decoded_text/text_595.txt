Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.
   - Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( J - 5 \).
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     J = 2 \times (J - 5)
     \]

3. **Solve for \( J \):**
   \[
   J = 2(J - 5)
   \]
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   \[
   J - 2J = -10
   \]
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   \[
   J = 10
   \]

4. **Determine Jerry's Age in 3 Years:**
   - Current age: 10 years
   - In 3 years: \( 10 + 3 = 13 \) years

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
