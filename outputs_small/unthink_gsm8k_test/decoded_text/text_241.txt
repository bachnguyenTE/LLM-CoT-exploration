To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Dolly's Books:**
   - Dolly has **2 books** (one own and one Pandora's).

2. **Pandora's Books:**
   - Pandora has **1 book** (Dolly's own).

3. **Both Reading Each Other's Books:**
   - Dolly will read Pandora's book.
   - Pandora will read Dolly's book.

4. **Total Books Read:**
   - Dolly reads **2 own books + 1 Pandora's book** = **3 books**.
   - Pandora reads **1 own book + 1 Dolly's book** = **2 books**.
   - **Total collectively read by both** = **3 + 2 = 5 books**.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{5}\)
