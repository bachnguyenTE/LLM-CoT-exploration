**Solution:**

Susan earns **\$5** every **100 minutes** (100 minutes). She works between **8:00 A.M.** and **11:00 A.M.** and pauses for **30 minutes** every hour.

1. **Total Time Worked:**
   - From **8:00 A.M.** to **11:00 A.M.** is **3** hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Time Paused:**
   - She pauses for **30 minutes**.

3. **Active Work Time:**
   - Total time: \(180 \text{ minutes}\)
   - Time paused: \(30 \text{ minutes}\)
   - Active work time: \(180 - 30 = 152 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate Earnings:**
   - Susan earns **\$5** every **100 minutes**.
   - Number of earnings: \(\frac{152}{110} \approx 1.37\)
   - Total earnings: \(1.37 \times 5 \approx \$6.85\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$6.85}
