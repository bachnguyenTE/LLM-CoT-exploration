**Solution:**

1. **Determine Josh's working hours per week:**
   - Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - A week has 7 days.
   - He is open on 5 days (Monday to Saturday).

2. **Calculate the number of cars he services in a week:**
   - He services 3 cars per day.
   - Total cars per week = 3 cars/day × 5 days = **15 cars/week**

3. **Calculate his weekly earnings:**
   - He is paid \$4 per car.
   - Weekly earnings = 15 cars × \$4/car = **\$60/week**

4. **Calculate his earnings for 2 weeks:**
   - Weekly earnings = \$60
   - For 2 weeks: \$60/week × 2 weeks = **\$120**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{120}
