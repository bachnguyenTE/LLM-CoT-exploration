Q: Sasha and Julie are best friends playing on opposing basketball teams. The teams have two practice games scheduled. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games.

1. **First Game (Sasha's Home):**
   - **Sasha's Points:** 14 points.
   - **Julie's Points:** Sasha scored 4 fewer points than her. So, Julie scored:
     \[
     14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]
   
2. **Second Game (Sasha's Away):**
   - **Sasha's Points:** Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Julie scored 10 points in the first game, and Sasha scored:
     \[
     10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]
   
3. **Total Points by Sasha:**
   - **First Game:** 14 points
   - **Second Game:** 4 points
   - **Total:** 
     \[
     14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]
   
**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{18}\)
