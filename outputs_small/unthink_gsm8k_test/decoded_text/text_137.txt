**Solution:**

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Subs:**
   - Number of subs: 2
   - Cost per sub: \$7.50
   - Total for subs: \( 2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00 \)

2. **Cost of Chips:**
   - Number of bags: 2
   - Cost per bag: \$1.50
   - Total for chips: \( 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \)

3. **Cost of Cookies:**
   - Number of cookies: 2
   - Cost per cookie: \$1.00
   - Total for cookies: \( 2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00 \)

4. **Total Order Before Delivery Fee:**
   - Add up all the costs:
     \[
     \$15.00 \ (\text{subs}) + \$3.00 \ (\text{chips}) + \$2.00 \ (\text{cookies}) = \$20.50
     \]

5. **Delivery Fee:**
   - Delivery fee: 20% of the total order
   - Calculation:
     \[
     20\% \times \$20.50 = 0.20 \times 20.50 = \$4.50
     \]
   - **Total with Delivery Fee:** 
     \[
     \$20.50 + \$4.50 = \$25.00
     \]

6. **Tip:**
   - Tip amount: \$5.00

7. **Final Total Cost:**
   - Add the tip to the total with delivery fee:
     \[
     \$25.00 + \$5.00 = \$30.00
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$30.00}
\]
