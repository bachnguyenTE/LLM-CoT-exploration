**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of hot dogs needed:**
   
   - John invited **20 people**.
   - Each guest will eat **2 hot dogs**.
   - **Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests × 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.**

2. **Calculate the number of hot dogs needed to buy:**
   
   - John already has **4 hot dogs** left over.
   - **Hot dogs to buy = 40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.**

3. **Determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:**
   
   - Each pack contains **6 hot dogs**.
   - **Number of packs needed = 36 hot dogs ÷ 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.**

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   - Each pack costs **\$2**.
   - **Total cost = 6 packs × \$2/pack = \$12.**

**Final Answer:**  
John needs to spend **\$12** on hot dogs.
