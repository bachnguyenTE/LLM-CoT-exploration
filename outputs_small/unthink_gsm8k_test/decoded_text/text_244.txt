Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries **Gringer** gave Griffin.

1. **Initial Fries:**
   - Griffin started with **24** fries.

2. **Kyle Takes Fries:**
   - Kyle took **5** fries from Griffin.
   - **Griffin's Fries After Kyle:** \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.

3. **Billy Takes Fries:**
   - Billy took **twice as many** as Kyle.
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - **Griffin's Fries After Billy:** \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.

4. **Gringer Gives Fries to Griffin:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of fries **Gringer** gave Griffin.
   - **Griffin's Fries After Receiving from Gringer:** \(9 + x\)

5. **Colby Takes Fries from Griffin:**
   - Colby took **3 less** than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
   - Kyle took **5** fries, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - **Griffin's Fruits After Colby Takes:** \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\)

6. **Final Fries for Griffin:**
   - In the end, Griffin had **27** fries.
   - So, \(7 + x = 27\)
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 27 - 7 = 20
     \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{20}\)
