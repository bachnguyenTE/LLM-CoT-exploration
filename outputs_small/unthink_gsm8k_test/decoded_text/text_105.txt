**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many cookies Amir eats:**
   
   Amir eats **5 cookies**.

2. **Calculate how many cookies Cody eats:**
   
   Cody eats **3 times** as many cookies as Amir. 
   
   So, the number of cookies Cody eats is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of cookies both of them eat together:**
   
   Add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats:
   \[
   5 + 15 = 10 \text{ cookies}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
