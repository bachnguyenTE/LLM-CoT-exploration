Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Initial Number of Cats:**
- **Total cats on the rock:** 50

**First Boat:**
- **Number of cats carried by each boat:** 5
- **Total cats carried by four boats:** \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
- **Remaining cats on the rock:** \(50 - 20 = 30\)

**Second Part:**
- **Fraction of remaining cats that ran after a mouse:** \(\frac{3}{5}\)
- **Number of cats that ran after a mouse:** \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\)
- **Number of cats remaining on the rock:** \(30 - 18 = 12\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
