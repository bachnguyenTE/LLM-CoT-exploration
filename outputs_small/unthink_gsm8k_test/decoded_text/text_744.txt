Q: Melissa works as a pet groomer. This week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed.

To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of animals:**
   - Dogs: 8
   - Cats: 5
   - Birds: 3
   - Horses: 12
   
   **Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals**

2. **Determine the number of days in the week:**
   - There are **7 days** in a week.

3. **Divide the total number of animals by the number of days:**
   \[
   \text{Animals per day} = \frac{28 \text{ animals}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ animals per day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
