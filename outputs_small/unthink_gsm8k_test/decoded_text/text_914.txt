**Solution:**

To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs for his car, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Tune-up Frequency:**
   - Jon needs a tune-up every **1000 miles**.

2. **Daily Driving:**
   - Jon drives **100 miles** each day.

3. **Monthly Driving:**
   - He drives for a **30-day month**.

4. **Total Miles Driven in the Month:**
   - Total miles = Daily miles × Number of days
   - Total miles = 100 miles/day × 30 days = **3000 miles**

5. **Number of Tune-Ups Needed:**
   - Since a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles, divide the total miles by the tune-up interval.
   - Number of tune-ups = Total miles / Tune-up interval
   - Number of tune-ups = 3300 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = **3.3**

6. **Interpreting the Result:**
   - Since Jon can't have a fraction of a tune-up, we need to round up to the next whole number.
   - Therefore, Jon needs **4 tune-ups** in that month.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{4}
