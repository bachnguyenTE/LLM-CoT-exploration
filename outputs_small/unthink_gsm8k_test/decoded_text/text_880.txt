**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost of the new rope:**
   
   - **Length of the new rope:** 10 meters
   - **Cost per meter:** \$1.50
   - **Total cost:** \( 10 \text{ meters} \times \$1.50/\text{meter} = \$15.00 \)

2. **Calculate the leftover money:**
   
   - **Total money Sarah has:** \$20.00
   - **Total cost of the new rope:** \$5.00
   - **Leftover money:** \( \$20.00 - \$5.00 = \$14.90 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$14.90}
