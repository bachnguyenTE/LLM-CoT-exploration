**Solution:**

1. **Convert the Length to Feet:**
   - Given length of the room: 3 yards.
   - Since 1 yard = 3 feet, 
     \[
     3 \text{ yards} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ feet}.
     \]

2. **Find the Width:**
   - The area of the room is given as 360 square feet.
   - Area formula for a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}.
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     360 = 9 \times \text{Width}.
     \]
   - Solve for Width:
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - Perimeter formula for a rectangle:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}).
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}.
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{98 \text{ feet}}
\]
