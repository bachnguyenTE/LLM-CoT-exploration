To find the average shoe size worn by Charlie and Sophie, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the sizes:**
   - Sophie wears size **5**.
   - Charlie's boots are **five times** the size of Sophie's. So, Charlie's boots are \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \).

2. **Calculate the average:**
   - Add both sizes together: \( 5 + 25 = 30 \).
   - Divide by the number of people: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{15}\)
