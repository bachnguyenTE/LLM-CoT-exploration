Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - **Maria's Friends:** She has 4 friends, and each received 2 water balloons.
     \[
     4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons} = 8 \text{ balloons}
     \]
   - **Maria:** She had 1 water balloon for herself.
     \[
     1 \text{ balloon}
     \]
   - **Total Balloons Initially:**
     \[
     8 \text{ (friends)} + 1 \text{ (Maria)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
     \]

2. **Mom's Additional Balloons:**
   - **Total People:** Maria and her 4 friends make a total of 5 people.
   - **Each Person Gets 3 More Balloons:**
     \[
     5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons} = 15 \text{ balloons}
     \]
   - **Total Balloons After Mom's Gift:**
     \[
     9 \text{ (initial)} + 15 \text{ (mom's gift)} = 24 \text{ balloons}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
