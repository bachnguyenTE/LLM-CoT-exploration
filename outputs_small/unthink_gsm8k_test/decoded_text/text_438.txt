To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **1. Calculate the Total Amount of Onions Needed**
- **Original recipe:** 2 pounds of onions.
- ** doubled:** \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) pounds of onions.

### **2. Calculate the Total Cost of Onions**
- **Onions on sale:** \$2.00 per pound.
- **Total cost for onions:** \( 4 \times \$2.00 = \$8.00 \).

### **3. Calculate the Total Cost of Beef Stock**
- **Beef stock needed:** 2 boxes.
- **Beef stock on sale:** \$2.00 per box.
- **Total cost for beef stock:** \( 2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00 \).

### **4. Calculate the Total Cost of Ingredients**
- **Total cost:** \( \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \).

### **5. Calculate the Number of servings**
- **Number of servings:** 6 people.

### **6. Calculate the Cost per Serving**
- **Cost per serving:** \( \frac{\$12.00}{6} = \$2.00 \).
