**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Dogs:**
   - Bernie has **4 dogs**.

2. **Exercise Requirements:**
   - **First dog:** Needs to walk **1 mile** per day.
   - **Second dog:** Needs to walk **4 miles** per day.
   - **Third dog:** Needs to walk **3 miles** per day.
   - **Fourth dog:** Needs to walk **? miles** per day (this is what we need to find).

3. **Total Daily Exercise for All Dogs:**
   - The problem states that **on average**, the dogs need to walk **3 miles** per day.
   - Since there are **4 dogs**, the total daily exercise required is:
     \[
     4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/day} = 12 \text{ miles/day}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Exercise for the Fourth Dog:**
   - **First dog:** 1 mile
   - **Second dog:** 4 miles
   - **Third dog:** 3 miles
   - Let \( x \) be the miles the fourth dog needs to walk.
   - Adding up the known and unknown values:
     \[
     1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     8 + x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 12 - 8 = 4
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The last (fourth) dog needs to walk **4 miles** per day on average.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
