Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.

**Given:**
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

**Substitute the first equation into the second:**
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

**Simplify the equation:**
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

**Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:**
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

**Subtract 9 from both sides:**
\[
3S = 18
\]

**Divide both sides by 3:**
\[
S = 6
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
