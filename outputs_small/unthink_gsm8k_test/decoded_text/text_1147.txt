Q: Lauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.  How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?

To determine how many days Lauren will need to create all the picture scenes, we'll calculate the time required for each type of scene separately and then sum them up.

1. **Large-Sized Picture Scenes:**
   - **Total needed:** 45
   - **Rate:** 5 per day
   - **Time needed:** \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days

2. **Medium-Sized Picture Scenes:**
   - **Total needed:** 36
   - **Rate:** 6 per day
   - **Time needed:** \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days

3. **Small-Sized Picture Scenes:**
   - **Total needed:** 49
   - **Rate:** 7 per day
   - **Time needed:** \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days

4. **Total Time Needed:**
   - **9 (large) + 6 (medium) + 7 (small) = 22 days**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{22}\) days
