Q: A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots they all have combined?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   
   It's given that a cobra has **70 spots** and that a cobra has **twice as many spots** as a mamba. Let's denote the number of spots on a mamba as \( M \).

   \[
   \text{Spots on a cobra} = 2 \times \text{Spots on a mamba}
   \]
   
   \[
   70 = 2M
   \]
   
   \[
   M = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
   
   So, a mamba has **35 spots**.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all the snakes:**
   
   - **Number of cobras:** 40
   - **Number of mambas:** 60
   
   \[
   \text{Total spots} = (\text{Number of cobras} \times \text{Spots per cobra}) + (\text{Number of mambas} \times \text{Spots per mamba})
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total spots} = (40 \times 70) + (60 \times 35)
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 1800 = 4680
   \]
   
3. **Find half of the total number of spots:**
   
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total spots}}{2} = \frac{4680}{2} = 2340
   \]
   
4. **Final Answer:**

   \[
   \boxed{2340}
   \]
