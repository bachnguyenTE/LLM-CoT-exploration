Q: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how far John is from home after his 4-hour drive.

1. **First Part of the Trip:**
   - **Time:** 3 hours
   - **Speed:** 60 mph
   - **Distance Covered:** 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \,00 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Position:** John is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - **Total Time Available:** 4 hours
   - **First 2 Hours:** Standstill (0 mph)
   - **Next 0.5 Hours:** Drives at 30 mph
   - **Remaining Time:** 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours
   - **Speed:** 80 mph

3. **Distance Covered During Return Trip:**
   - **First 2 Hours:** 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 0 \times 2 = 0 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Next 0.5 Hours:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \times 0.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Remaining 1.5 Hours:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \times 1.5 = 120 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Total Distance During Return Trip:**
     \[
     0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Final Position:**
   - **Distance from Home:** 
     \[
     180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
     \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{45}\) miles
