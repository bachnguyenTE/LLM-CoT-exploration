**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of Ali's class:**
   - Ali teaches a class with **120 students**.

2. **Find the capacity of John's classes:**
   - Each of John's classes has **1/8** the capacity of Ali's class.
   - **John's class capacity = 120 students × (1/8) = 15 students per class.**

3. **Calculate the combined capacity of both schools:**
   - **John's school has 2 classes:**  
     **Total capacity = 2 × 15 students = 10 students.**
   - **Ali's school has 1 class:**  
     **Total capacity = 120 students.**
   - **Combined capacity = 120 + 10 = 132 students.**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{132}
