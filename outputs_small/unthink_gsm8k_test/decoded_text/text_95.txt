To determine how many girls are not in the girl scout, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of Grade 5 students: 200
- Fraction of boys: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
- Fraction of girls in the girl scout: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

**Step 1: Find the number of boys in Grade 5.**

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

**Step 2: Find the number of girls in Grade 5.**

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of boys} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Find the number of girls in the girl scout.**

\[
\text{Girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

**Step 4: Find the number of girls not in the girl scout.**

\[
\text{Girls not in girl scout} = \text{Total girls} - \text{Girls in girl scout} = 120 - 88 = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
