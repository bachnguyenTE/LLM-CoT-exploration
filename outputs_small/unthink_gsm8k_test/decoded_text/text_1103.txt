Q: A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- A jellyfish tank has a certain number of jellyfish.
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
- A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
- The other jellyfish (small) are always blue.
- When a UV light turned on, **6 jellyfish** changed color.

**Let’s denote:**
- Let \( J \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

**Step 1: Determine the number of large jellyfish.**
Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large:
\[
\text{Large jellyfish} = \frac{1}{5}J
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of large jellyfish that change color.**
A third of the large jellyfish change color:
\[
\text{Large jellyfish that change color} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J
\]

**Step 3: Relate the number of changing jellyfish to the total number of large jellyfish.**
We know that 6 jellyfish changed color:
\[
\frac{1}{15}J = 6
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( J \).**
\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
