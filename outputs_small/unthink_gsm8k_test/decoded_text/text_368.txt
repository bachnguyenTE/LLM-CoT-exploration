Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points.

**Given:**
- After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.
- Sara scored 8 points.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( E \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

**Relationship:**
According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. This means:
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
\]
Since Sara scored 8 points:
\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]
\[
E +14 = 24
\]

**Solving for \( E \):**
\[
E = 24 - 14
\]
\[
E = 10
\]

**Final Answer:**
Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring the 14 points.
