To determine the number of boys in each class, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of students in both classes: 80
- Each class has the same number of students
- 40% of the students in each class are girls

**Step 1: Find the number of students in each class.**

Since there are two classes with the same number of students, we can divide the total number of students by 2.

\[
\text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of girls in each class.**

44% of the students in each class are girls.

\[
\text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times 0.44 = 17.6
\]

Wait, this results in a decimal number of students, which doesn't make sense. Let's double-check the calculations.

**Rechecking Step 1:**

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40 \quad \text{(Correct)}
\]

**Rechecking Step 2:**

\[
44\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.44 \times 40 = 17.6
\]

Hmm, getting a decimal here suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or the interpretation. Let's assume that the percentages are correct and proceed.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of boys in each class.**

If 44% of the students are girls, then the remaining percentage are boys.

\[
\text{Percentage of boys} = 100\% - 44\% = 56\%
\]

Now, calculate 56% of 40 students.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 40 \times 0.56 = 22.4
\]

Again, we get a decimal number, which doesn't make sense in the context of counting students. This indicates that there might be an inconsistency in the given data.

**Conclusion:**

Given the calculations, it's not possible to have a whole number of boys in each class if 44% of 40 students are girls. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided percentages.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{22}
