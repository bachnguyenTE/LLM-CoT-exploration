**Solution:**

To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Bob needs **56 popsicle sticks**.
   - Each box contains **8 popsicles**.
   - Number of boxes required = Total popsicle sticks / Popsicles per box
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each box costs **\$2.00**.
   - Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 7 \times \$2.00 = \$14.70
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$14.70}
\]
