Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old **Jackson** is.

1. **Given Information:**
   - Emily has 4 kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
   - **Amy** is 5 years older than **Jackson**.
   - **Amy** is 2 years younger than **Corey**.
   - **James** is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than **Corey**.

2. **Let’s Define Variables:**
   - Let **J** represent **Jackson's age**.
   - Let **A** represent **Amy's age**.
   - Let **C** represent **Corey's age**.
   - **James's age** is given as **10 years**.

3. **From James:**
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - So, **C = J + 1**.

4. **From Amy and Corey:**
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - So, **A = C - 2**.
   - But Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson.
   - So, **A = J + 5**.

5. **Now, let's express everything in terms of **J**.**

   - From **C = J +1**, we have **C** in terms of **J**.
   - Substitute **C** into **A = C - 2**:
     \[
     A = (J + 1) - 2 = J - 1
     \]
   - But we also have **A = J + 5** from earlier.
   - So, set the two expressions for **A** equal:
     \[
     J - 1 = J + 5
     \]
   
6. **Solve for **J**.**
   - Subtract **J** from both sides:
     \[
     -1 = 5
     \]
   - This is a **contradiction**, which suggests there's an error in the given information or our interpretation.

7. **Re-examining the Given:**
   - James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - So, **C = J +1 = 10 +1 = 11**.
   - Now, **A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9**.
   - But **A = J +5** implies **9 = J +5**, so **J = 4**.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - **Jackson is 4 years old.**

\boxed{4}
