Q: Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.
2. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
3. She earned a total of \$120 from the sales.
4. Each small stuffed animal costs \$4.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( L \) = number of large stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( S \) = number of small stuffed animals sold.

**From the problem:**
- She sold **twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones**:
  \[
  S = 2L
  \]
  
- The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one. However, we are given the **cost of each small stuffed animal** directly as \$4, so we don't need to find the price of a large one.

- Total earnings from sales:
  \[
  \text{Total} = \text{Price of small} \times S + \text{Price of large} \times L = 120
  \]
  But since we know the price of a small stuffed animal is \$4, and we don't have the price of a large one, we can proceed without it.

**Now, let's set up the equation using the total earnings:**
\[
4S + (3 \times 4)L = 120
\]
But since \( S = 2L \), substitute \( S \) in the equation:
\[
4(2L) + 12L = 120
\]
\[
8L + 12L = 120
\]
\[
20L = 120
\]
\[
L = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

**Number of large stuffed animals sold:** \( L = 6 \)

**Number of small stuffed animals sold:** \( S = 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
