Q: Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away.

To determine how much money Milly will lose, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the Book:**
   - The book costs **\$32**.

2. **Shipping Charges:**
   - **Cost per pound:** **\$0.35**
   - **Distance:** **20 miles**
   - **Total shipping cost:** 
     \[
     20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$7.00
     \]

3. **Total Cost Before Refund:**
   - **Book cost:** **\$32**
   - **Shipping cost:** **\$7.0**
   - **Total:** 
     \[
     \$32 + \$7.0 = \$39.00
     \]

4. **Refund by Amazon:**
   - **Percentage refund:** **75%**
   - **Refund amount:** 
     \[
     75\% \times \$39.00 = \$29.25
     \]

5. **Amount Milly Will Lose:**
   - **Total cost:** **\$39.00**
   - **Refund received:** **\$29.25**
   - **Loss:** 
     \[
     \$39.00 - \$29.25 = \$9.75
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$9.75}
\]
