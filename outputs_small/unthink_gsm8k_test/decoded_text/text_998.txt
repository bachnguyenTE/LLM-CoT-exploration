**Solution:**

1. **Total Cookies Brought to the Reception:**
   
   - There are **100 guests** at the reception.
   - Each guest brought **15 cookies**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 500 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Cookies Given to the Church:**
   
   - The **bride** decided to give **1/2** of the cookies to the church.
   
   \[
   \text{Cookies given to church} = \frac{1}{2} \times 550 = 275 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Number of People in the Church:**
   
   - Each person in the church received **15 cookies**.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of people} = \frac{275 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 15 \text{ people}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
