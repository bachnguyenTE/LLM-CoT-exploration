Q: Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms in it. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, and the third bag has a hole in it, so it only has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. How many M&Ms did Mary get total?

Let's determine the total number of M&Ms Mary bought step by step.

1. **First Bag:**
   - **Number of M&Ms:** 300

2. **Second Bag:**
   - **Number of M&Ms:** 300 (first bag) + 12 = **312**

3. **Third Bag:**
   - **Number of M&Ms:** Half of 300 = 150

4. **Total M&Ms:**
   - **First Bag + Second Bag + Third Bag:** 300 + 312 + 150 = **762**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{762}\)
