Q: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange and pineapple drinks.

### **Given:**
1. **Orange Drink:**
   - Total volume: 10 liters
   - Fraction that is water: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Fraction that is orange (non-water): \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)

2. **Pineapple Drink:**
   - Total volume: 15 liters (since \( 15 \) liters is mentioned, but wait, the problem says 15 liters? Let me check the original problem again.)
   
   **Wait a minute!** The problem states:
   
   "I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?"

   
   Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy here. The problem mentions 15 liters of pineapple drink, but the total after mixing would be 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters. However, let's proceed with the given information.

3. **Orange Drink Calculation:**
   - **Water in orange drink:**
     \[
     \text{Water} = 10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 6.66667 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Orange (non-water) in orange drink:**
     \[
     \text{Orange} = 10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 3.33333 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Pineapple Drink Calculation:**
   - **Water in pineapple drink:**
     \[
     \text{Water} = 15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Pineapple (non-water) in pineapple drink:**
     \[
     \text{Pineapple} = 15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{5} = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **After Spilling:**
   - **Orange Drink Remaining:**
     \[
     10 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Orange Drink Water Remaining:**
     \[
     \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 6.66667 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Pineapple Drink Volume:**
     \[
     15 \text{ liters} - 0 \text{ liters} = 15 \text{ liters} \quad (\text{since no spillage of pineapple drink})
     \]
   - **Pineapple Drink Water:**
     \[
     9 \text{ liters}
     \]

6. **Total Water in the Mixture:**
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = \text{Orange Drink Water} + \text{Pineapple Drink Water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \approx 15.66667 \text{ liters}
   \]

7. **Total Volume of the Mixture:**
   \[
   9 \text{ liters (orange)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple)} = 24 \text{ liters}
   \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{\dfrac{47}{3} \text{ liters}}
   \]
   Or approximately \( 15.\overline{6} \) liters.

However, since the problem might expect a whole number, let's verify the calculations:

- **Orange Drink Water:** \( \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.66667 \) liters
- **Pineapple Drink Water:** 9 liters
- **Total Water:** \( 6.66667 + 9 = 15.66667 \) liters

So, the exact amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3
