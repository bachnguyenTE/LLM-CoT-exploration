**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Going to John's Friend's House:**
   - **Distance:** 200 miles
   - **Speed:** 70 mph
   - **Time:** \( \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \)

2. **Taking a Detour:**
   - **Added Distance:** 10 miles
   - **New Distance:** 200 + 10 = 210 miles
   - **Time:** \( \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \)

3. **Returning Home:**
   - **Distance:** 240 miles
   - **Speed:** 80 mph
   - **Time:** \( \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \)

4. **Total Time:**
   - Sum all the individual times.

**Calculations:**

1. **Going to Friend:**
   \[
   \frac{200}{70} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **With Detour:**
   \[
   \frac{210}{70} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Returning Home:**
   \[
   \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Time:**
   \[
   2.857 + 1.5 + 3 = 7.357 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7.36 \text{ hours}}
\]
