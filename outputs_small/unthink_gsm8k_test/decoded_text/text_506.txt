**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of the snowshoes for Mario's 6 sled dogs, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of dogs:**
   - Mario has **6 dogs**.

2. **Find out how many dogs each pair of snowshoes can cover:**
   - Each pair of snowshoes has **4 legs** (assuming each dog has 4 legs).

3. **Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:**
   - Number of pairs = Total number of dogs / Number of dogs per pair
   - Number of pairs = 6 dogs / 4 dogs per pair = **1.5 pairs**

4. **Determine the cost per pair of snowshoes:**
   - Each pair costs **\$12.00**

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   - Total cost = 1.5 pairs × \$12.00 = **\$18.00**

**Final Answer:**
\[
