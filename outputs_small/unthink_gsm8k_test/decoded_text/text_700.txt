To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Fireworks in the City:**
   - There are 15 boxes, each containing 20 fireworks.
   - Total fireworks = \( 15 \times 20 = 150 \) fireworks.

2. **Fireworks Hannah Sees in the City:**
   - Hannah sees 40% of the city's fireworks.
   - Fireworks seen = \( 40\% \times 150 = 0.4 \times 150 = 60 \) fireworks.

3. **Fireworks Hannah Sees in Her Backyard:**
   - Hannah sets off 3 boxes, each containing 5 fireworks.
   - Fireworks seen = \( 3 \times5 = 15 \) fireworks.

4. **Total Fireworks Hannah Sees:**
   - Total = Fireworks in the city + Fireworks in her backyard
   - Total = \( 60 + 15 = 75 \) fireworks.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{75}\)
