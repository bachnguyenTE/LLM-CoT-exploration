Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
- One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
- There are **6 Pomeranian girls**.

**Let’s denote:**
- Total number of puppies = \( P \)
- Number of Pomeranians = \( \frac{2}{3}P \)
- Number of Pomeranian girls = \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \)

**Given that the number of Pomeranian girls is 6:**
\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

**Solve for \( P \):**
\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27
\]

**Therefore, Jana has \(\boxed{27}\) puppies.**
