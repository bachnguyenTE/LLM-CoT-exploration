**Solution:**

Let's break down Sylvie's salary increase step by step.

1. **Initial Salary:**
   - Sylvie is paid **\$600** per month.
   - **Annual Salary = 12 months × \$600 = \$7,200**.

2. **First Increase:**
   - Sylvie has been with the company for **5 years**.
   - **First increase:** 10% of the initial salary.
   - **Increase = 10% of \$7,200 = 0.10 × \$7,200 = \$720**.
   - **New Annual Salary after 1st increase = \$7,200 + \$720 = \$7,920**.

3. **Second Increase:**
   - Sylvie has been with the company for **5 + 3 = 8 years**.
   - **Second increase:** 10% of the salary after the first increase.
   - **Increase = 10% of \$7,920 = 0.10 × \$7,920 = \$871.20**.
   - **New Annual Salary after 2nd increase = \$7,920 + \$871.20 = \$8,791.20**.

4. **Final Annual Salary:**
   - After 3 more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary is **\$8,791.20**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$8,\!791.20}
