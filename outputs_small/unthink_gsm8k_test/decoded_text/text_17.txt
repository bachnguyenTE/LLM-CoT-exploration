To determine Jill's annual salary, we'll calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from Teaching:**
   - **Hourly wage:** \$200 per hour
   - **Hours per week:** 35 hours
   - **Weeks per year:** 50 weeks

   \[
   \text{Annual salary from teaching} = 20 \times 35 \times 50 = 35,000
   \]

2. **Earnings from Coaching:**
   - **Hourly wage:** \$300 per hour
   - **Hours per week:** 15 hours
   - **Weeks per year:** 50 weeks

   \[
   \text{Annual salary from coaching} = 30 \times 15 \times 50 = 22,500
   \]

3. **Total Annual Salary:**
   \[
   \text{Total annual salary} = 35,000 + 22,500 = 57,500
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{57,\!500}
\]
