To determine how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Bed dimensions:** 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- **Each piece of fabric:** 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

**Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric.**

- **Length of fabric:** \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- **Width of fabric:** \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric.**

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total fabric needed for two pieces.**

\[
\text{Total Area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
