**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - **Red cards:** 15
   - **Green cards:** 60% more than red cards
   - **Yellow cards:** Equal to the sum of red and green cards

2. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   
   Green cards are 60% more than red cards.
   
   \[
   \text{Green cards} = \text{Red cards} + 60\% \times \text{Red cards} = 15 + 0.6 \times 15 = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow cards:**
   
   Yellow cards are equal to the sum of red and green cards.
   
   \[
   \text{Yellow cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} + \text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{78}
\]
