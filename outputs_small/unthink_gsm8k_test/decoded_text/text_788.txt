**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Trip Cost:** The school trip costs **\$300**.

2. **School's Contribution:** The school has agreed to cover **half** of the trip cost.
   
   \[
   \text{School's Contribution} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$300 = \$150
   \]

3. **John's Current Amount:** John has **\$50** saved up.

4. **Amount John Still Needs:** Subtract John's current amount from the school's contribution to find out how much more he needs.

   \[
   \text{Amount John Still Needs} = \$150 - \$50 = \$100
   \]

**Final Answer:**
John is missing **\$100** to cover his share of the trip.
