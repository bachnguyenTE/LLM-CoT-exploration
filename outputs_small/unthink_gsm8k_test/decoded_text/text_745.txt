**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine Mark's profit.

1. **Total Cost:**
   - Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards.
   - Each pack costs \$1800.
   - **Total Cost = 3 × \$1800 = \$5400**

2. **Total Revenue:**
   - He receives 3 types of cards:
     - **First card:** \$4000
     - **Second card:** \$1000
     - **Remaining 30 cards:** Each worth an average of \$50
   - **Total from remaining cards = 30 × \$50 = \$1500**

3. **Total Money Received:**
   - **Total Revenue = \$4000 + \$1000 + \$1500 = \$6600**

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - **Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost**
   - **Profit = \$6600 - \$5400 = \$1200**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{1200}
