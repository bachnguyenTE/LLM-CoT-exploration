**Solution:**

We are given that the cell-phone recharges at a rate of **1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes**. The phone is currently at **60% charged**, and we need to determine how long it will take to fully charge.

1. **Determine the remaining charge:**
   
   The phone is at **60% charged**, so the remaining charge to reach 100% (fully charged) is:
   
   \[
   100\% - 60\% = 36\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the recharge rate per minute:**
   
   The phone recharges **1 percentage-point** every **3 minutes**. To find the recharge rate per minute:
   
   \[
   \frac{1\%}{3\ \text{minutes}} = \frac{1}{3}\% \text{ per minute}
   \]

3. **Determine the time required to recharge the remaining 36%:**
   
   Using the recharge rate:
   
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Remaining Charge}}{\text{Recharge Rate per Minute}} = \frac{36\%}{\frac{1}{3}\% \text{ per minute}} = 36 \times 3 = 108\ \text{minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   
   \[
   \frac{108\ \text{minutes}}{60} = 1.8\ \text{hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1.8\ \text{hours}}
\]
