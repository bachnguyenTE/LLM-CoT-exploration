A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Amount Spent:**
   Bob spends a total of **\$27,000** on buying books. (Note: The amount is written with a comma as thousand separator, so it's **\$27,0000**.)

2. **Books Bought:**
   Bob buys **100 books** for **\$500**.

3. **Finding the Price per Book:**
   To find out how much each book costs, divide the total amount by the number of books:
   \[
   \text{Price per book} = \frac{\$500}{100} = \$5
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Number of Books:**
   Now, to find out how many books Bob can buy in total:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = \frac{\$27,000}{\$5} = 5,400 \text{ books}
   \]
   Since you can't buy a fraction of a book, we'll consider the whole number:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 5,400 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Books per School:**
   If Bob wants to distribute these books equally among **3 schools**, divide the total number of books by the number of schools:
   \[
   \text{Books per school} = \frac{5,400}{3} = 1,800 \text{ books per school}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Bob can buy **1,800 books per school**.

\[
\boxed{1,\!800}
\]
