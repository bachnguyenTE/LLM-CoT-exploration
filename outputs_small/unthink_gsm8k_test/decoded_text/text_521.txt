Let's break down Chris's math homework step by step.

1. **Total Problems:** Chris has **100 math problems** to complete.

2. **Monday Night:**
   - **Problems Completed:** 12
   - **Remaining Problems:** \(100 - 12 = 88\)

3. **Tuesday:**

   - **Calculation:** \(3 \times 12 = 36\)
   - **Remaining Problems:** \(88 - 36 = 52\)

4. **Wednesday:**
   - **Problems Completed:** One-quarter of the remaining problems
   - **Calculation:** \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\)
   - **Remaining Problems:** \(52 - 13 = 39\)
