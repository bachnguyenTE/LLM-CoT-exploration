**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of history teachers:**
   
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers}
   \]

2. **Find the number of math teachers:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total teachers} - \text{History teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers:**
   
   \[
   \text{Each teacher sleeps } 6 \text{ hours} \\
   \text{Total sleep time} = 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 360 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{360 \text{ hours}}
\]
