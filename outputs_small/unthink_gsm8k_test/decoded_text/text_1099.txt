Q: The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?

To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest, we'll calculate the time taken for each slide and then find the difference.

**Given:**
- **Biggest Slide:** 300 feet long
- **Speed of Biggest Slide:** 60 feet per minute
- **Second Biggest Slide:** 240 feet long
- **Speed of Second Biggest Slide:** 80 feet per minute

**Step 1: Calculate the time taken for each slide.**

The formula to calculate time is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

- **Time for the biggest slide:**
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{big}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

- **Time for the second biggest slide:**
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} \approx 2.94 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Find the difference in time.**

\[
\Delta \text{Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{big}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 2.94 \text{ minutes} \approx 2.06 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2.06 \text{ minutes}}
\]
