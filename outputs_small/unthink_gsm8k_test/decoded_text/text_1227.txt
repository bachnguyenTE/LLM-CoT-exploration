Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Susan's Magazines:**
   - **Magazine 1:** Sends **12 issues per year.**
   - **Magazine 2:** Sends **6 issues per year.**
   - **Magazine 3:** Sends **4 times the amount of Magazine 2.**

2. **Calculate the Issues from Magazine 3:**
   \[
   \text{Issues from Magazine 3} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. **Total Issues per Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total Issues} = 12 + 6 + 24 = 42 \text{ issues}
   \]

4. **Number of Magazines per Year:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Magazines} = \frac{42}{12} = 3.5
   \]

However, since Susan cannot have half a magazine, it's likely that the problem assumes whole magazines. Therefore, the total number of magazines she receives every year is:

\[
\boxed{3.5}
\]
