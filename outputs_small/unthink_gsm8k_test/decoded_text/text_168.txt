Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Jimmy has \$2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has \$8, how much money is Jimmy having?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Ethel has \$8.
   - Jimmy has \$2 more than twice Ethel's money.

2. **Express Jimmy's money in terms of Ethel's money:**
   - Let \( E \) represent Ethel's money.
   - Let \( J \) represent Jimmy's money.
   - According to the problem, \( J = 2E + 2 \).

3. **Substitute the known value of Ethel's money:**
   - \( E = \$8 \).
   - Substitute into the equation: \( J = 2(8) + 2 \).

4. **Perform the calculations:**
   - \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \).
   - \( 16 + 2 = 18 \).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Jimmy has \$18.

**Answer:** \boxed{18}
