Q: Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip.

### **First Week:**
1. **First 4 Days:**
   - **Distance per day:** 200 kilometers
   - **Total distance for 4 days:** \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - **Total distance for 2 days:** 30% of the first 4 days
   - **Calculate 30% of 800 km:**
     \[
     0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
     \]
   - **Total distance for these 2 days:** 240 km

3. **Next Day:**
   - **Distance:** 0 km

4. **Total Distance for the First Week:**
   \[
   800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} = 1024 \text{ km}
   \]

### **Second Week:**
1. **Next 7 Days:**
   - **Distance per day:** 300 kilometers
   - **Total distance for 7 days:** \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next Day:**
   - **Distance:** 0 km

3. **Total Distance for the Second Week:**
   \[
   2100 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

### **Total Distance for the Two-Weeks:**
\[
1024 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3124 \text{ km}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3124}
\]
