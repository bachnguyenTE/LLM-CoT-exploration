Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many letters the post office delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

**Monday:**
- The post office delivered **425 letters**.

**Tuesday:**
- They delivered **17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday**.
- **One-fifth of Monday's deliveries:** \( \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \) letters.
- **Total Tuesday's deliveries:** \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

**Wednesday:**
- They delivered **5 more than twice as many as Tuesday**.
- **Twice Tuesday's deliveries:** \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \) letters.
- **Total Wednesday's deliveries:** \( 224 + 5 = 229 \) letters.

**Total Letters Delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
- **Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday:** \( 425 + 102 + 229 = 756 \) letters.

\boxed{756}
