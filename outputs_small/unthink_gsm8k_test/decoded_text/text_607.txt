**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total cost of the shampoo:**
   - The jumbo bottle costs **\$24.00**.

2. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - **Total washings:** 120
   - **Cost per washing:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$24.00}{120 \text{ washings}} = \$0.20 \text{ per washing}
     \]

3. **Find the cost per pump:**
   - **Total pumps:** 2
   - **Cost per pump:** 
     \[
     \frac{\$0.20}{1 \text{ pump}} = \$0.20 \text{ per pump}
     \]

4. **Convert the cost to cents:**
   - **\$0.20** is equivalent to **20 cents**.

**Final Answer:**  
Each pump costs **20 cents**.
