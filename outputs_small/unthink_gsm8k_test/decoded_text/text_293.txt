Q: Three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony decided to play a game. After 3 rounds Mike has 21 points, Jim 3 points less than Mike, and Tony 2 times more than Mike.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Mike** has 21 points.
- **Jim** has 3 points less than Mike.
- **Tony** has 2 times more than Mike.

**Step 1: Calculate the points for each player after 3 rounds.**

1. **Mike's points:** 21 points.
2. **Jim's points:** 21 (Mike's points) - 3 = **18 points**.
3. **Tony's points:** 2 × 21 = **42 points**.

**Step 2: Distribute extra points in the fourth round.**

- **Extra points condition:** Every player gets an extra point if they have **over 20 points**.
- **Check each player:**
  - **Mike:** 21 points (not over 20) → No extra.
  - **Jim:** 18 points (over 20) → Gets 1 extra point.
  - **Tony:** 42 points (over 22) → Gets 1 extra point.

**Step3: Calculate total points after extra points.**

- **Mike:** 21 + 0 = **21 points**.
- **Jim:** 18 + 1 = **19 points**.
- **Tony:** 42 +1 = **43 points**.

**Final Total Points:**
\[
21 + 19 + 43 = 83
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{83}\)
