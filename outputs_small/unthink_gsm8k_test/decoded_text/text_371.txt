Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.

1. **First Day (Friday):**
   - **Sold:** 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Second Day (Saturday):**
   - **Sold:** Double the number sold on Friday.
   - **Calculation:** \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Third Day (Sunday):**
   - **Sold:** Half the number sold on Saturday.
   - **Calculation:** \( 28 \div 2 = 14 \) pairs.
   - **Adjustment for Returns:** 6 pairs were returned.
   - **Final Sales:** \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

4. **Total Sold:**
   - **Friday:** 14 pairs
   - **Saturday:** 28 pairs
   - **Sunday:** 8 pairs
   - **Total:** \( 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \) pairs.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{50}\)
