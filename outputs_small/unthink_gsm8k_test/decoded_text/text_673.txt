**Solution:**

Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem:
- Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.
- Janey has 21 books.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[
\text{Janey's books} = 2 \times S + 3
\]
Given that Janey has 21 books:
\[
21 = 2S + 3
\]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[
21 - 3 = 2S \\
18 = 2S \\
S = \frac{18}{2} \\
S = 9
\]

**Answer:** Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books.
