**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( M \) represent Mia's current age.
   - Let \( E \) represent Emma's current age.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age.
   - Mia is younger than Emma, so \( E > M \).
   - Mia is 40 years old.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The age difference between Emma and Mia is 16 years.
   - Therefore, \( E - M = 16 \).

4. **Substitute Mia's Age:**
   - Since \( M = 40 \), substitute into the equation:
     \[
     E - 40 = 16
     \]

5. **Solve for Emma's Age:**
   \[
   E = 40 + 16 = 56
   \]

6. **Calculate the Average of Their Ages:**
   - The average age is the sum of their ages divided by 2.
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{M + E}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
