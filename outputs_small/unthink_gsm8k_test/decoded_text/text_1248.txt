To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Sales per 25 telephone calls:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets **1 person** to look at cars.

2. **Car sales per 2 customers:**
   - For every **2 customers**, **1 car** is sold.

3. **Total cars needed:**
   - Jason needs to sell **15 cars**.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars.**

Since **1 car** is sold for every **2 customers**, the number of customers needed is:
\[
\text{Number of customers} = 15 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ customers per car} = 30 \text{ customers}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers.**

Since **1 person** is sold for every **25 telephone calls**, the number of telephone calls needed is:
\[
\text{Number of telephone calls} = 30 \text{ customers} \div 2 \text{ customers per 25 calls} = 15 \times 25 = 75 \text{ telephone calls}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
