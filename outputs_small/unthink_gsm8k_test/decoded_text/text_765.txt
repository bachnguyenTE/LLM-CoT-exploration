**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Relationship:**
   - George has **45% more pears** than bananas.
   - George has **200 bananas**.

2. **Calculating the Number of Pears:**
   - If George has 45% more pears than bananas, this means:
     \[
     \text{Number of Pears} = \text{Number of Bananas} + 45\% \times \text{Number of Bananas}
     \]
   - Plugging in the number of bananas:
     \[
     \text{Number of Pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200
     \]
   - Calculate \(0.45 \times 200\):
     \[
     0.45 \times 200 = 90
     \]
   - So,
     \[
     \text{Number of Pears} = 200 + 90 = 290
     \]

3. **Total Number of Fruits:**
   - Add the number of bananas and pears:
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Number of Bananas} + \text{Number of Pears} = 200 + 290 = 490
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{490}
\]
