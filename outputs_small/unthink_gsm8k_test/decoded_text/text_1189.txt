**Solution:**

1. **Total Apple Slices:** The apple was sliced into 8 pieces.

2. **Eating Pattern:**
   - **Doxa:** Ate 1 slice.
   - **Sister:** Ate 1 more than Doxa, so 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
   - **Brother:** Ate 1 more than Sister, so 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

3. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Doxa: 1 slice
   - Sister: 2 slices
   - Brother: 3 slices
   - **Total = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices**
