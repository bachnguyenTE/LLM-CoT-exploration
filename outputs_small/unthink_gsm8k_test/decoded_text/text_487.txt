**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total oats consumed per horse per day:**
   - Each horse eats **5 pounds** of oats per meal.
   - Feeds **2 meals** a day.
   - **Total per horse per day:** \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the total for all four horses:**
   - **Total per day:** \( 10 \text{ pounds} \times 4 = 40 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Find the total for five days:**
   - **Total for 5 days:** \( 40 \text{ pounds} \times 5 = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains **50 pounds** of oats.
   - **Number of bags:** \( \frac{220 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4.4 \) bags.

5. **Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, round up to the next whole number:**
   - **Total bags needed:** **5 bags**.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{5}\)
