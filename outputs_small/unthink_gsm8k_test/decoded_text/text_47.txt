Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
- He spent \$200 on blue ties that cost \$40 each.

**Find:**
- Total amount spent on ties.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of blue ties bought:**
   
   - Each blue tie costs \$40.
   - Total cost for blue ties = \$200.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total cost for blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]
   
   So, John bought 5 blue ties.

2. **Determine the number of red ties bought:**
   
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   
   So, John bought 10 red ties.

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 50\% \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]
   
   So, each red tie costs \$60.

4. **Calculate the total cost for red ties:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]
   
   So, John spent \$600 on red ties.

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
   \]
   
   So, John spent a total of \$800 on ties.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{800}
\]
