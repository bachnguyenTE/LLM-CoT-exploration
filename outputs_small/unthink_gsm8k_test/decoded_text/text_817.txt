**Solution:**

Paul needs a total of **63 cupcakes** for his birthday party. He already has:

- **8 chocolate cupcakes**
- **40 toffee cupcakes**

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has:**
   
   \[
   8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 52 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total needed:**
   
   \[
   63 \text{ (total needed)} - 52 \text{ (already has)} = 11 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Paul needs to buy **11 more cupcakes**.

\[
\boxed{11}
