Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Bob currently has a certain number of marbles.
- If Bob receives **2 dozen** more marbles, he will have **60 marbles**.

**Step 1:** Determine how many marbles Bob currently has.

- **2 dozen** marbles = \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.

- If Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

- Let \(x\) be the current number of marbles Bob has.

- Therefore, \(x + 24 = 60\).

- **Solve for \(x\):**
  \[
  x = 60 - 24 = 36
  \]

**Step 2:** Determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his current marbles.

- Bob currently has **36** marbles.

- If he loses **10** marbles:
  \[
  36 - 10 = 26
  \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
