Q: Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. If Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, how big is Timothy's locker in cubic inches?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker.
- Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( Z \) be the volume of Zack's locker.
- Let \( T \) be the volume of Timothy's locker.
- Let \( P \) be the volume of Peter's locker.

**From the problem:**
1. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker:
   \[
   Z = \frac{1}{2}T
   \]
2. Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker:
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{4}Z
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches:
   \[
   P = 5 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

**Step 1:** Substitute the value of \( P \) into the second equation to find \( Z \):
\[
5 = \frac{1}{4}Z
\]
Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for \( Z \):
\[
Z = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

**Step 2:** Now, use the value of \( Z \) to find \( T \) using the first equation:
\[
20 = \frac{1}{2}T
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( T \):
\[
T = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
