Q: Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the costs and her savings step by step.

**Total Cost:**
- Jacket: \$30
- 2 pairs of shoes: 2 × \$20 = \$40
- **Total Cost:** \$30 + \$40 = **\$73**

**Savings:**
- Sara already has \$10 saved.

**Amount Needed:**
- Total Cost - Savings = \$73 - \$10 = **\$62**

**Earnings from Jobs:**
- **Babysitting:**
  - \$5 per session
- **Mowing Lawns:**
  - \$4 per session

**Let \( x \) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.**

**Total Earnings:**
- From babysitting: 4 sessions × \$5 = **\$20**
- From mowing lawns: \( x \) sessions × \$4 = **\$4x**
- **Total Earnings:** \$20 + \$4x

**Equation:**
\[
\$20 + \$4x = \$62
\]

**Solving for \( x \):**
\[
4x = \$62 - \$20 = \$42
\]
\[
x = \frac{\$42}{4} = \$10.5
\]

Since Sara can't mow half a lawn, she needs to mow **11 times** to cover the remaining cost.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
