To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, follow these steps:

1. **Vanilla Sents Sold:**
   - Number of vanilla scents available: 4
   - Sells: 5 of each vanilla scent
   - **Total vanilla sold:** \(4 \times 5 = 20\)

2. **Fruity Sents Sold:**
   - Number of fruity scents available: 8
   - Sells: 2 of each fruity scent
   - **Total fruity sold:** \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

3. **Difference in Sales:**
   - **Vanilla sold - Fruitful sold:** \(20 - 16 = 14\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{14}\)
