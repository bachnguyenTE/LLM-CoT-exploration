**Solution:**

We need to determine how much each of the 20 students raised for the charity.

1. **Total Amount Raised:**
   \[
   \$175,0000
   \]
   
2. **Amount Raised by Organizations:**
   \[
   \$50,000
   \]
   
3. **Amount Raised by Students:**
   \[
   \text{Total} - \text{Organizations} = \$175,000 - \$50,000 = \$120,000
   \]
   
4. **Amount Each Student Raised:**
   \[
   \frac{\$120,000}{20 \text{ students}} = \$6,000 \text{ per student}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$6,\!000}
\]
