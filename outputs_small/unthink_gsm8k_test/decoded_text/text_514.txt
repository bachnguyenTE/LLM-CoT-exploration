Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
A house and a lot cost \$120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
   - The cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot, so the house costs \( 3L \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost of the house and the lot is \$120,000.
   - Therefore, \( L + 3L = 120,000 \).

3. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - \( 4L = 120,000 \).

4. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120,000}{4} \).
   - \( L = 30,000 \).

5. **Find the Cost of the House:**
   - The house costs \( 3L \).
   - \( 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \).

**Final Answer:**
The house cost \(\boxed{90,\!000}\).
