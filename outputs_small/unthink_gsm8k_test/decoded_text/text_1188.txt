Q: Digimon had its 20th anniversary.  When it came out John was twice as old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old is Jim?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - John and Jim are two people.
   - On the 20nd anniversary of Digimon, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Currently, John is 28 years old.
   - We need to find Jim's current age.

2. **Setting Up the Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent John's current age.
   - Let \( M \) represent Jim's current age.

3. **Given Information:**
   - John is 28 years old now: \( J = 28 \).
   - John was twice as old as Jim at the 22nd anniversary. This implies that at the time of the 22nd anniversary, John's age was twice Jim's age.

4. **Calculating the Age Difference:**
   - The difference in their ages is constant and does not change over time.
   - Let’s denote the age difference as \( D \).
   - So, \( D = J - M \).

5. **Applying the Age Difference:**
   - At the 22nd anniversary, John's age was \( J - D \).
   - At that time, John was twice as old as Jim: \( J - D = 2M \).

6. **Substituting the Known Values:**
   - We know \( J = 28 \), so:
     \[
     28 - D = 2M
     \]
   - But we also know that \( D = J - M = 28 - M \).

7. **Substituting \( D \) in the Equation:**
   - Substitute \( D = 28 - M \) into \( 28 - D = 2M \):
     \[
     28 - (28 - M) = 2M
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     28 - 28 + M = 2M \\
     M = 2M
     \]
   - Wait, this leads to \( M = 0 \), which doesn't make sense. Let's check our approach.

8. **Re-examining the Approach:**
   - The mistake lies in the interpretation of the age difference.
   - At the 22nd anniversary, John was twice as old as Jim. So, the age difference remains the same.
   - Let’s denote the age difference as \( D \).
   - So, \( D = J - M \).
   - At the 22nd anniversary, John's age was \( J - D \), and Jim's age was \( M - D \).
   - Given that \( J - D = 2(M - D) \).

9. **Setting Up the Correct Equation:**
   \[
   J - D = 2(M - D)
   \]
   - Substitute \( D = J - M \):
     \[
     J - (J - M) = 2(M - (J - M))
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     J - J + M = 2(M - J + M) \\
     M = 2(2M - J) \\
     M = 4M - 2J \\
     \]
   - Rearranging:
     \[
     M - 4M = -2J \\
     -3M = -2J \\
     3M = 2J \\
     M = \frac{2}{3}J
     \]

10. **Solving for Jim's Age:**
    - We know \( J = 28 \):
      \[
      M = \frac{2}{3} \times 28 = \frac{16}{3} = 5\frac{1}{3}
      \]
    - However, ages are typically whole numbers, so this suggests a miscalculation.

11. **Re-evaluating the Age Difference Approach:**
    - Let’s consider that the age difference remains constant.
    - Let’s denote the age difference as \( D \).
    - So, \( D = J - M \).
    - At the 22nd anniversary, John's age was \( J - D \), and Jim's age was \( M - D \).
    - Given that \( J - D = 2(M - D) \).
    - Substitute \( D = J - M \):
      \[
      J - (J - M) = 2(M - (J - M)) \\
      M = 2(2M - J) \\
      M = 4M - 2J \\
      \]
    - Rearranging:
      \[
      M - 4M = -2J \\
      -3M = -2
