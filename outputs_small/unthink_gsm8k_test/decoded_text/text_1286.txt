To determine how much money James has in cents, we'll calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Quarter:** A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   \[
   1 \times 25\text{c} = 25\text{c}
   \]

2. **Nickels:** Each nickel is worth 5 cents. James has 2 nickels.
   \[
   2 \times 5\text{c} = 10\text{c}
   \]

3. **Dimes:** Each dime is worth 10 cents. James has 7 dimes.
   \[
   7 \times 10\text{c} = 70\text{c}
   \]

Now, add up all the values:
\[
25\text{c} + 10\text{c} + 70\text{c} = 105\text{c}
\]

**Final Answer:** James has a total of \(\boxed{105}\) cents.
