To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pupils in the Class:**
   - There are **29 pupils** in the class.

2. **Bottles of Apple Juice Given to Each Student:**
   - Each student receives **2 bottles** of apple juice for lunch.

3. **Total Bottles Given to All Students:**
   - Total bottles = Number of students × Bottles per student
   - Total bottles = 29 × 2 = **58 bottles**

4. **Total Coupons and Bottles from Coupons:**
   - The teacher has **9 coupons**.
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for **100 bottles** of apple juice.
   - Total bottles from coupons = Number of coupons × Bottles per coupon
   - Total bottles from coupons = 9 × 100 = **900 bottles**

5. **Total Bottles Available for the Teacher:**
   - Total bottles = Bottles from coupons + Bottles given to students
   - Total bottles = 900 + 58 = **958 bottles**

6. **Bottles Left for the Teacher:**
