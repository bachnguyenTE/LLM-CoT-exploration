**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:**
   - Each box contains 90 contacts.
   - 2 boxes = \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) contacts.

2. **Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:**
   - Each box costs \$100.00.
   - 2 boxes = \( 1000.00 \times 2 = 200.00 \) dollars.

3. **Find the cost per pair of contacts:**
   - Total cost = \$200.00
   - Number of pairs = 180
   - Cost per pair = \( \frac{200.00}{180} = 1.1111 \) dollars.

4. **Round to the nearest cent:**
   - Cost per pair ≈ \$1.111

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1.11}
\]
