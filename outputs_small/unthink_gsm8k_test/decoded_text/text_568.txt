**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Richie's Goals:**
   - Richie scored **80 goals**.

2. **Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored **20 more goals** than Mark.
   - Let Mark's goals be \( M \).
   - According to the problem: 
     \[
     80 = M + 20
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 80 - 20 = 68
     \]
   - Mark scored **68 goals**.

3. **Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored **45 more goals** than Anna.
   - Let Anna's goals be \( A \).
   - According to the problem:
     \[
     80 = A + 45
     \]
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 88 - 45 = 43
     \]
   - Anna scored **43 goals**.

4. **Total Goals:**
   - Now, let's add up all the goals scored by the three teenagers:
     \[
     \text{Richie} + \text{Mark} + \text{Anna} = 80 + 68 + 43 = 199
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{199}
\]
