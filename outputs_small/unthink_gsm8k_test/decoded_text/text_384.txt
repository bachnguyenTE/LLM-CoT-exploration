Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?

**Solution:**

1. **Let \( x \) be the total land Mr. Ruther had initially.**

2. **He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land.**  
   Therefore, the amount of land he sold is:  
   \[
   \frac{3}{5}x
   \]

3. **He had 12.8 hectares left after selling.**  
   This means the remaining land is:  
   \[
   x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 32
   \]

**Answer:**
Mr. Ruther initially had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land.
