**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the twenties and the cost of the quarters.

1. **Calculating the cost of the twenties:**
   - Each twenty is worth **\$20**.
   - Carrie spent **3/5** of the twenties.
   - **Amount spent on twenties:** 
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 20 = \frac{3}{5} \times 20 = 12
     \]
     So, she spent **\$12** on twenties.

2. **Calculating the cost of the quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth **\$0.25**.
   - Carrie spent all **140** quarters.
   - **Amount spent on quarters:** 
     \[
     140 \times 0.25 = 35
     \]
     So, she spent **\$35** on quarters.

3. **Calculating the total amount spent:**
   \[
   12 + 35 = 47
   \]
   
**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{47}\)
