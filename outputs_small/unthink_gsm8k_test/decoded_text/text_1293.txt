**Solution:**

To determine how much money the company will receive from selling its chocolate bars over two weeks, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in one week:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total bars per week} = 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35,\!000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total bars over two weeks} = 35,\!000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70,\!000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total revenue from selling all the chocolate bars:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 70,\!000 \text{ bars} \times \$2/\text{bar} = \$140,\!000
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$140,\!000}
\]
