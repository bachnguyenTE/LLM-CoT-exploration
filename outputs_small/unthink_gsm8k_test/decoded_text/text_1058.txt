Let's determine how many stickers Leo has in his collection step by step.

1. **Two years ago:**  
   Leo had **100 stickers**.

2. **Last year:**  
   Leo collected **50 stickers**.

3. **This year:**  
   Leo collected **twice the number of stickers** as last year.  
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers}
   \]

4. **Total stickers in the collection:**  
   Add the stickers from each year:  
   \[
   100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 260 \text{ stickers}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{260}
\]
