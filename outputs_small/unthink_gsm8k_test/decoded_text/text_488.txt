To determine how many girl Pomeranians Jana has, follow these steps:

1. **Total Pomeranians**:  
   Jana has \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her 27 puppies as Pomeranians.  
   \[
   \text{Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
   \]

2. **Girl Pomeranians**:  
   One third of the Pomeranians are girls.  
   \[
   \text{Girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
