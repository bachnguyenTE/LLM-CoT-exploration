To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - The **1959 penny** weighs **48 grains**.
   - The **2010 penny** is **three-quarters** the weight of the **1959 penny**.

2. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:**
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2210 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2210 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2210 penny} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined weight:**
   
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2210 penny}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{84 \text{ grains}}
\]
