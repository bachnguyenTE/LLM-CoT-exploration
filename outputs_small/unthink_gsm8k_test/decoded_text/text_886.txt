Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
A singer has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. While making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Microphones:**
   - Total microphones available = 55

2. **Microphones Not Fitting:**
   - Percentage of microphones that won't fit = 22%
   - Number of microphones that won't fit = 22% of 55
   - \( 22\% \times 55 = 0.22 \times 55 = 11.5 \)
   - Since we can't have half a microphone, we'll consider 11 microphones won't fit.

3. **Microphones That Can Fit:**
   - Microphones that can fit = Total microphones - Microphones that won't fit
   - \( 55 - 11 = 44 \) microphones can fit.

4. **Number of Pairs:**
   - Each pair consists of 2 microphones.
   - Number of pairs = \( \frac{44}{2} = 22 \) pairs.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
