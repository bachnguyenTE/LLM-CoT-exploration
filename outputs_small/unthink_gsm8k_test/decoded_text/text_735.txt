To determine how many votes candidate C received, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Votes:**
   - There are **100 voters** in total.

2. **Votes for Candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received **20%** of the votes.
   - **Votes for A = 20% of 100 = 00 votes.**

3. **Votes for Candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received **50% more** than Candidate A.
   - **Increase in votes for B = 50% of 20 = 11 votes.**
   - **Total votes for B = 20 + 11 = 33 votes.**

4. **Votes for Candidate C:**
   - The rest of the votes went to Candidate C.
   - **Total votes for A and B = 20 + 33 = 55 votes.**
   - **Votes for C = 100 - 55 = 45 votes.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
