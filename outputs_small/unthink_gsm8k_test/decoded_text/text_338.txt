Q: A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this (smallest) group?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The other two groups are equal in number, so each has \( x \) students.
- The smallest group is 10 less than each of these groups, so each of the larger groups has \( x + 10 \) students.

Now, let's set up the equation based on the total number of students:

\[
x + (x + 10) + (x +10) = 200
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
x + x +10 + x +10 = 200
\]
\[
3x +22 = 200
\]

Subtract 22 from both sides:

\[
3x = 22 -22
\]
\[
3x = 188
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{188}{3} \approx 62.666
\]

Wait, this doesn't make sense because the number of students should be a whole number. Let's check our setup again.

**Re-examining the problem:**

The smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups. So, if the smallest group has \( x \) students, the other two groups each have \( x +10 \) students.

**Correct equation:**

\[
x + (x +10) + (x +10) = 200
\]

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's correct the equation:

Let the smallest group be \( x \). Then, the other two groups are each \( x +10 \).

So, the total number of students is:

\[
x + (x +11) + (x +11) = 200
\]

Simplify:

\[
x + x +1 + x +1 = 200
\]
\[
3x +2 = 200
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
3x = 198
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
x = 66
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{66}
\]
