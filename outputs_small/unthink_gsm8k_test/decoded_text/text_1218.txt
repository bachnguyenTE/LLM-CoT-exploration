Q: Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 – 7 and each year they are challenged to earn as many Accelerated Reader points as they can. The 10 students in each grade with the most points get to try an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. They have 45 minutes to try and escape. If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?

To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Students Trying the Escape Room:**
   - There are **10 students** in each grade (4–7) who qualify for the escape room.
   - **Total students = 10 students/grade × 3 grades = 30 students.**

2. **Escape Room Capacity:**
   - Only **8 students** can try the escape room at a time.

3. **Number of Groups Needed:**
   - To accommodate all 30 students, we need to divide them into groups of 8.
   - **Number of groups = 30 students ÷ 8 students/group = 4 groups.**
   - However, since you can't have a fraction of a group, you'll need **5 groups** (4 groups of 8 and 1 group of 6).

4. **Time per Group:**
   - Each group has **45 minutes** to try the escape room.
   - Since all groups use their full 45 minutes, the total time required is **45 minutes per group × 5 groups = 225 minutes.**

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours (Optional):**
   - **225 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3.75 hours.**
   - This is equivalent to **3 hours and 45 minutes.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{225\ \text{ minutes}}
\]
