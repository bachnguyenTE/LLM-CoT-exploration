**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Students Playing Tennis:**
   - There are **6 students** playing tennis.

2. **Number of Students Playing Volleyball:**
   - It is mentioned that there are **twice the number of students playing tennis** playing volleyball.
   - Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Number of Students Playing Soccer:**
   - There are **16 boys** and **22 girls** playing soccer.
   - So, the total number of students playing soccer is:
     \[
     16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Students:**
   - Since each student only participates in one group, we add up the students from all three sports:
     \[
     6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
