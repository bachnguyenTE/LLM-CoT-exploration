To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we'll add the durations of both movies together.

1. **First Movie:** 1 hour and 30 minutes  
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes  
   - Total for the first movie: 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. **Second Movie:** 2 hours and 5 minutes  
   - 2 hours = 120 minutes  
   - Total for the second movie: 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

3. **Total Time:**  
   - 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 224 minutes

**Final Answer:** \boxed{224}
