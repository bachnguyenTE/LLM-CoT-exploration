To determine the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks, let's break down the information step by step.

### **Meditation Practice**
- **Daily Meditation:** Charisma meditates for **15 minutes** when she wakes up and again before she goes to sleep.
- **Frequency:** She practices meditation **5 days a week**.

**Calculation:**
\[
\text{Total meditation time per week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 75 \text{ minutes/week}
\]
\[
\text{Total meditation time over 4 weeks} = 75 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Yoga Practice**
- **Daily Yoga:** Charisma practices **1 hour** of yoga every day.
- **Frequency:** This is mentioned as "before she goes to sleep," but since it's a daily practice, we'll assume it's done every day.

**Calculation:**
\[
\text{Total yoga time per day} = 1 \text{ hour/day} = 60 \text{ minutes/day}
\]
\[
\text{Total yoga time over 4 weeks} = 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Total Time Spent**
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Meditation} + \text{Yoga} = 300 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 540 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Convert minutes to hours:**
\[
540 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9\text{ hours}}
\]
