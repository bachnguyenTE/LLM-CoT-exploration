Q: Mr. Maxim works at The Best Cookeries Around restaurant. On a particular day, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning to eat. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant and ordered the same amount of food as the first people. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day.

1. **Initial Entry in the Morning:**
   - **People who entered in the morning:** 50
   - **People who entered at 10:0:** 40

2. **People Entering at 10:00:**
   - **People who entered at 10:0:** 40
   - **People who entered twice the number of people who entered at 10:0:** \(2 \times 40 = 80\)

3. **People Entering by Evening:**
   - **Additional people:** 3 times as many as those who entered first at 10:0
   - **Additional people:** \(3 \times 40 = 120\)

4. **Total Entry for the Day:**
   - **Morning:** 50
   - **10:0:** 40
   - **10:00:** 80
   - **Evening:** 120

   **Total Entry = 50 + 40 + 80 + 120 = 298**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{298}
\]
