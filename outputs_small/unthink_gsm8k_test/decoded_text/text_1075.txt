Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many quarters Jenny has left after buying the roses.

**Given:**
- **Roses:** \$2 each or \$15 for a dozen.
- **Number of Roses Purchased:** 15
- **Amount of Money Available:** 5 × \$5 = \$25
- **Change Available:** Only quarters.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of 15 Roses**

First, determine the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost \$15, we can find the cost per rose and then multiply by 15.

\[
\text{Cost per rose} = \frac{\$15}{12} \approx \$0.4167
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 15 roses} = 15 \times \$0.41667 \approx \$20.50
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Change Received**

Jenny has \$25 and spends approximately \$20.50 on roses.

\[
\text{Change} = \$25 - \$20.50 = \$4.499
\]

Since she only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change into quarters.

\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{\$4.499}{\$0.25} \approx 17.99
\]

Since she can't have a fraction of a quarter, we'll consider the exact amount she can give with whole quarters.

**Step 3: Calculate the Exact Change in Quarters**

\[
\text{Total change in quarters} = \frac{\$4.499}{\$0.25} = 17.99 \approx 18 \text{ quarters}
\]

However, since she can't have a fraction of a quarter, we'll take the whole number of quarters she can give, which is 17 quarters.

**Final Answer:**

Jenny will have **17 quarters** left after buying the roses.

\[
\boxed{17}
\]
