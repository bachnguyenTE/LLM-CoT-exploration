**Solution:**

Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), based on the given ratio of \(7:11\).

The sum of their ages is given as 162 years:
\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]
\[
18x = 162
\]
\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[
\text{Allen's age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \text{ years}
\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[
99 + 10 = 109 \text{ years}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{119}
\]
