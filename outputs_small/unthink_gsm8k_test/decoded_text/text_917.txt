**Solution:**

First, let's determine the total number of pieces of fruit Kira bought.

- **Apples:** 3 pieces
- **Bananas:** 5 pieces
- **Oranges:** 6 pieces

**Total pieces of fruit:**
\[
3 \text{ (apples)} + 5 \text{ (bananas)} + 6 \text{ (oranges)} = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

**Fruit left after Lola ate:**
\[
14 \text{ (total pieces)} - 2 \text{ (eaten)} = 12 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
