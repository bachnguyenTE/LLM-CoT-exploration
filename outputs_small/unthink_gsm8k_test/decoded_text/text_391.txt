**Solution:**

We are given that the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is **5:6**, and together they have **165** popsicles. We need to find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - The ratio **5:6** means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.
   - This can be represented as:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Betty's popsicles}}{\text{Sam's popsicles}} = \frac{5}{6}
     \]

2. **Express the Total in Terms of the Ratio:**
   - Let’s denote Betty's popsicles as **5x** and Sam's popsicles as **6x**.
   - The total number of popsicles is:
     \[
     5x + 6x = 11x
     \]
   - We know the total is **165**, so:
     \[
     11x = 165
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
     \]

3. **Find the Number of Popsicles Each Has:**
   - Betty's popsicles:
     \[
     5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
     \]
   - Sam's popsicles:
     \[
     6x = 6 \times 15 = 90
     \]

4. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - Sam has **90** popsicles, Betty has **75**.
   - Difference:
     \[
     90 - 75 = 15
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
