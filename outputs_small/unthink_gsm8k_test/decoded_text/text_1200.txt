Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the variable:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]
   (Note: The right side is written as 40, not 40 as in the original problem. It's a minor typo, but we'll proceed with 40.)

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 40 - 8
   \]
   \[
   4x = 32
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{32}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

**Answer:**
The teacher’s lounge has \(\boxed{8}\) coffee mugs.
