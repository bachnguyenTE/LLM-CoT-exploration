To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we'll break down the costs for each type of clothing and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost for each type of clothing.**

- **Blouses:**  
  Alicia has 5 blouses per week, and each costs \$5.00.  
  \[
  5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00/\text{ blouse} = \$25.00
  \]

- **Pants:**  
  Alicia has 1 pair of pants per week, and each costs \$8.00.  
  \[
  1 \text{ skirt} \times \$8.00/\text{ skirt} = \$8.00
  \]

- **Skirts:**  
  Alicia has 2 pants per week, but there's no mention of skirts being charged. So, skirts cost \$0.00 per week.  
  \[
  2 \text{ pants} \times \$0.00/\text{pair} = \$0.00
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weekly cost.**

\[
\$25.00 + \$8.00 + \$0.00 = \$33.00 \text{ per week}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks.**

\[
5 \text{ weeks} \times \$33.00/\text{week} = \$165.00
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$165.0}
\]
