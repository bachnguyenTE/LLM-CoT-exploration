Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total cherries = 60
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

**Let’s denote:**
- Richard's cherries = R
- Jerry's cherries = J

**From the problem:**
1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard:
   \[
   R + 10 = 30
   \]
   \[
   R = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   
3. Total cherries = Richard's cherries + Jerry's cherries + Robert's cherries:
   \[
   20 + J + 30 = 60
   \]
   \[
   52 + J = 60
   \]
   \[
   J = 60 - 52 = 10
   \]

**Question:**
How many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?

\[
30 - 11 = 20
\]

**Answer:**
\boxed{20}
