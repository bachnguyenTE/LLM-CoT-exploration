Q: Chris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in "turtle" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in "rabbit" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?

To determine how many minutes it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of turtle and rabbit modes, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Understanding the Modes:**
1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in **1 hour** (60 minutes).
   - This means the mowing rate in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
     \]

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in **40 minutes**.
   - This means the mowing rate in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
     \]

### **Combining the Modes:**
Chris mowed half of the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. Let's denote:
- **Total Area of the Lawn** as \( A \).
- **Time taken in turtle mode** as \( t_1 \).
- **Time taken in rabbit mode** as \( t_2 \).
- **Total Time taken** as \( T \).

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode:
\[
\frac{A}{2} = \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} \times t_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{A}{2} = \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} \times t_2
\]

### **Calculating Individual Times:**
1. **Time in Turtle Mode (\(t_1\)):**
   \[
   t_1 = \frac{\frac{A}{2}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}}} = \frac{\frac{A}{2}}{\frac{1}{60}} = \frac{A}{2} \times 60 = 30A \text{ minutes}
   \]
   
2. **Time in Rabbit Mode (\(t_2\)):**
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{\frac{A}{2}}{\text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}}} = \frac{\frac{A}{2}}{\frac{1}{40}} = \frac{A}{2} \times 40 = 20A \text{ minutes}
   \]

### **Total Time (\(T\)):**
\[
T = t_1 + t_2 = 30A + 20A = 50A \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Conclusion:**
Chris took **50 minutes** to mow the entire lawn by using a combination of turtle and rabbit modes.

\[
\boxed{50 \text{ minutes}}
\]
