Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of money raised by all the girls.

1. **Alexandra's Raise:**
   - Alexandra raises **\$430**.

2. **Kim's Raise:**
   - Kim raises **\$320** more than Alexandra.
   - **Total for Kim** = Alexandra's raise + \$320
   - **Total for Kim** = \$430 + \$320 = **\$752**

3. **Sarah's Raise:**
   - Sarah raises **\$300**.

4. **Maryam's Raise:**
   - Maryam raises **\$400** more than Sarah.
   - **Total for Maryam** = Sarah's raise + \$400
   - **Total for Maryam** = \$300 + \$400 = **\$744**

5. **Total Money Raised:**
   - **Alexandra** + **Kim** + **Sarah** + **Maryam**
   - **Total** = \$430 + \$752 + \$300 + \$744

   Let's add these amounts step by step:
   - **\$430 + \$752 = \$1,182**
   - **\$1,182 + \$300 = \$1,482**
   - **\$1,482 + \$744 = \$2,226**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2226}
\]
