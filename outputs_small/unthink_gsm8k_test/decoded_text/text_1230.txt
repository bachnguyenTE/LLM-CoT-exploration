Q: Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Charlie's reduced rate for veterans:**
   
   - **Standard fee:** \$80 per hour
   - **Reduction for veterans:** 25%
   - **Reduced rate:** \(80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \) per hour

2. **Calculate the total earnings from standard lessons:**
   
   - **Number of standard lessons:** 4
   - **Earnings per standard lesson:** \$80
   - **Total earnings:** \(4 \times 80 = \$320\)

3. **Calculate the total earnings from veteran lessons:**
   
   - **Number of veteran lessons:** 2
   - **Earnings per veteran lesson:** \$60
   - **Total earnings:** \(2 \times 60 = \$120\)

4. **Calculate the total amount Charlie will make for the day:**
   
   - **Total earnings:** \(320 + 120 = \$442\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{442}
