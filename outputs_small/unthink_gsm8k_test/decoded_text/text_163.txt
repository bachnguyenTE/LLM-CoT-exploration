A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - **Red cars:** 5 units
   - **Action figures:** 3 units
   - **Doll:** 1 unit
   - **Cost of a red car:** \$4
   - **Cost of a doll:** Equal to 3 action figures

2. **Determine the cost of an action figure:**
   - Given that a doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we don't have the exact cost yet, we'll keep it as a variable for now.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all toys:**
   - **Red cars:** 5 cars × \$4/car = \$20
   - **Action figures:** 3 figures × (unknown cost) = 3 × (unknown)
   - **Doll:** 1 doll × (3 action figures) = 3 × (unknown)

4. **Express the total cost in terms of the unknown:**
   - Total cost = \$20 + 3 × (unknown) + 3 × (unknown)
   - Simplify: Total cost = \$20 + 6 × (unknown)

5. **However, we need the exact cost of an action figure to find the total.**
   - Since the problem doesn't provide the cost of an action figure directly, we need to infer it from the given information.

6. **Re-examining the problem:**
   - It mentions that "the doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost \$4."
   - This suggests that the cost of the doll is related to the action figures, but without additional information, we can't determine the exact cost of an action figure.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Without knowing the exact cost of an action figure, we cannot calculate the total worth of all toys.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$20 + 6 \times (\text{unknown cost of an action figure})}
