**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total calories in the 300g bag:**
   
   - **Calories per serving:** 250 calories
   - **Number of servings:** 5
   - **Total calories:** \( 250 \,000 \times 5 = 1,250,000 \) calories

2. **Calculate the remaining calories for the day:**
   
   - **Total daily calorie target:** 2000 calories
   - **Calories already consumed:** 1,800 calories
   - **Remaining calories:** \( 2,000 - 1,800 = 1,200 \) calories

3. **Determine the number of grams of chips you can eat:**
   
   - **Calories per gram:** \( \frac{1,250,000}{300} \approx 3,833 \) calories per gram
   - **Grams you can eat:** \( \frac{1,200}{3,833} \approx 0,316 \) grams

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0,316\ \text{grams}}
\]
