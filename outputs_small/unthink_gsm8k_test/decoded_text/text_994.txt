Q: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for **20 seconds**.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for **twice as long** as Tobias.
   - **Chikote's duration = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds.**

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for **as long as the other two wolves combined.**
   - **Igneous's duration = Tobias's duration + Chikote's duration = 20 s + 40 s = 60 seconds.**

4. **Total Duration of All Howls:**
   - **Total = Tobias's duration + Chikote's duration + Igneous's duration**
   - **Total = 20 s + 40 s + 60 s = 122 seconds**

5. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - **1 minute = 60 seconds**
   - **Total in minutes = 122 s ÷ 60 s/min ≈ 2.033 minutes**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{2.033}
