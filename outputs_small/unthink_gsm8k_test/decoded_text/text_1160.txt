To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total reports received in the week:** 5168
2. **Reports received on Monday and Tuesday:** 1907
3. **Reports received on Thursday and Friday:** 2136

Let's denote:
- \( M \) = reports on Monday
- \( T \) = reports on Tuesday
- \( W \) = reports on Wednesday
- \( Th \) = reports on Thursday
- \( F \) = reports on Friday

From the given data:
\[
M + T + W + Th + F = 5168
\]
\[
M + T = 1907
\]
\[
Th + F = 2136
\]

**Step 1:** Add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday:
\[
(M + T) + (Th + F) = 1907 + 2136 = 4043
\]

**Step 2:** Subtract this sum from the total reports to find Wednesday's reports:
\[
W = 5168 - 4443 = 1725
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{1725}\)
