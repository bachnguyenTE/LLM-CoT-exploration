**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Julie starts with \$500.

2. **Spending on Clothes:**
   - She spends 20% of her money on clothes.
   - **Calculation:** \( 20\% \) of \$500 is \( 0.20 \times 500 = \$110 \).
   - **Remaining Money After Clothes:**
     \[
     550 - 110 = 440
     \]
     So, she has \$440 left after buying clothes.

3. **Spending on CDs:**
   - She spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
   - **Calculation:** \( 25\% \) of \$440 is \( 0.25 \times 440 = \$110 \).
   - **Remaining Money After CDs:**
     \[
     440 - 110 = 330
     \]
     So, she has \$330 left after buying CDs.

4. **Final Amount Left:**
   After spending on clothes and CDs, Julie has **\$330** left.

**Answer:** \(\boxed{330}\)
