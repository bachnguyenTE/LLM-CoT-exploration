Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Nick had twice as many candies as George.
- George ate 5 candies.
- After eating, George has 3 candies left.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George had initially.
- Therefore, Nick had \( 2G \) candies initially.

**After George ate 5 candies:**
- George has \( G - 5 \) candies left.
- According to the problem, \( G - 5 = 3 \).

**Solving for \( G \):**
\[
G - 5 = 3 \\
G = 3 + 5 \\
G = 8
\]

**Now, find the number of candies Nick had initially:**
\[
\text{Nick's candies} = 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
