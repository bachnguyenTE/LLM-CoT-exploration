Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of games lost.
   - Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won is \( L + 8 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of games played is the sum of games won and games lost.
   \[
   L + (L + 8) = 22
   \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( L \):**
   \[
   L + L + 8 = 22 \\
   2L + 8 = 22 \\
   2L = 22 - 8 \\
   2L = 14 \\
   L = \frac{14}{2} \\
   L = 7
   \]

4. **Find the Number of Games Won:**
   \[
   \text{Games Won} = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
