Q: Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?

To determine what percentage of the distance Michael has covered, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 3 \,000 \, \text{hr} = 165,000 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage of of the total distance covered:**
   
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{16,000 \, \text{km}}{165,000 \,000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100\% \approx 3.636\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3.64\%}
\]
