Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of bees in the hive = 700
- Number of worker bees = 2 × number of baby bees
- Number of baby bees = 2 × number of queens

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( Q \) = number of queen bees
- Then, number of baby bees = \( 2Q \)
- Number of worker bees = \( 2 \times \text{baby bees} = 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \)

**Total number of bees:**
\[
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
\]
\[
7Q = 700
\]
\[
Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

**Number of worker bees:**
\[
4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{400}
\]
