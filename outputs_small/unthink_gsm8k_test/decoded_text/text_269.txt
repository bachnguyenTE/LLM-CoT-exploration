To determine the number of blue golf balls the juggler is juggling, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Balls:** The juggler has 16 balls.

2. **Golf Balls:** Half of these balls are golf balls.
   \[
   \text{Number of Golf Balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8
   \]

3. **Blue Golf Balls:** Half of the golf balls are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of Blue Golf Balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:** There are \boxed{4} blue golf balls.
