**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of people:**
   - **Team members:** 12
   - **Guests per team member:** 2
   - **Total guests:** \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
   - **Total people (team + guests):** \(12 + 24 = 36\)

2. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed:**
   - **People per pizza:** 3
   - **Number of pizzas:** \(\frac{36}{3} = 2\)

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - **Cost per pizza:** \$15
   - **Total cost:** \(2 \times 15 = 30\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{30}\)
