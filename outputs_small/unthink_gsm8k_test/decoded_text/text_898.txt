Q: Dijana and Anis live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Dijana's Rowing Distance:**
   - Dijana rowed a total of **50 miles** that day.

2. **Anis's Rowing Distance:**
   - Anis rowed **1/5 times more** than Dijana.
   - To find the additional distance, calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 50 miles:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, Anis rowed:
     \[
     50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total Distance Rowed by Both:**
   - Add Dijana's and Anis's distances:
     \[
     50 + 60 = 116 \text{ miles}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{116}
\]
