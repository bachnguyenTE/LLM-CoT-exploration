Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Tim spent in total.

1. **First Firework Package:**
   - **Cost:** \$400
   - **Discount:** 20% off

   To calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 88
   \]
   
   Subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 400 - 88 = 312
   \]

2. **Second Firework Package:**
   - **Cost:** Twice the first package
   \[
   2 \times 400 = 800
   \]
   
   **Discount:** 20% off

   Calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 800 \times \frac{20}{100} = 800 \times 0.20 = 176
   \]
   
   Subtract the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 800 - 176 = 624
   \]

3. **Finale Firework:**
   - **Cost:** \$150

4. **Total Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 312 + 624 + 150 = 1086
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1086}
\]
