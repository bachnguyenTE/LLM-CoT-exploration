**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of People:**
   - **Total people at the polling station:** 5000

2. **Voting Progression:**
   - **By midday (12:00):** \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - **By 16:00 (4:00 PM):** \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.

3. **Calculations:**

   - **Voters by Midday:**
     \[
     \text{Voters by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
     \]
   
   - **Remaining People by Midday:**
     \[
     \text{Remaining} = 5500 - 2200 = 3300
     \]
   
   - **Voters by 16:00:**
     \[
     \text{Voters by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3300 = 2200
     \]
   
   - **Total Voted by 16:00:**
     \[
     \text{Total Voted} = 2200 + 2200 = 4400
     \]
   
   - **Voters who Did Not Vote by 16:00:**
     \[
     \text{Non-Voters} = 5500 - 4400 = 1100
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1100}
\]
