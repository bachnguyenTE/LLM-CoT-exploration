**Solution:**

1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Day} = \$2 \times 5 = \$10
   \]

2. **Determine his weekly earnings:**
   
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days per Week} = \$10 \times 4 = \$40
   \]

3. **Find out how many weeks are needed to save \$80:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{\$80}{\$40} = 2.2 \text{ weeks}
   \]

   Since John can't work a fraction of a week, he will need **3 weeks** to save at least \$80.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
