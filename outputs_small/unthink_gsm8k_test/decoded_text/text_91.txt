Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
3. Cindy has four pets.

**Step 1: Determine the number of pets Marcia has.**

Cindy has **4 pets**.

Marcia has **two more pets** than Cindy:
\[
\text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of pets Jan has.**

Jan has **three times the number of pets** as Marcia:
\[
\text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets.**

Add the number of pets each person has:
\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{28}
\]
