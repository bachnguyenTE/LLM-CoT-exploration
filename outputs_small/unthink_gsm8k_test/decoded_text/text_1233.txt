**Solution:**

1. **Total Apples Purchased:**
   Walter bought **60 apples**.

2. **Apples Eaten:**
   Walter ate **\( \frac{2}{5} \) of the apples**.
   \[
   \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples after eating} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. **Apples Given to Sister:**
   Walter gave **25%** of the remaining apples to his sister.
   \[
   \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Apples Sold to Uncle:**
   Walter sold the remaining **27 apples** to his uncle at **\$3 each**.
   \[
   \text{Total money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{81}
\]
