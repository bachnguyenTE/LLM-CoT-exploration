Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Total Pizzas:**
- There are **5** pizzas in total (Bryce and four friends).
- Each pizza has **12** slices.
- **Total slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.**

**Pizzas Eaten by Bryce and Two Friends:**
- **Bryce and two friends** ate **2/3** of their pizzas.
- **Each pizza has 12 slices**, so **2/3 of a pizza = (2/3) × 12 = 8 slices.**
- **Total slices eaten by these three = 3 people × 8 slices = 24 slices.**

**Pizzas Eaten by the Remaining Two Friends:**
- **The other two friends** ate **3/4** of their pizzas.
- **3/4 of a pizza = (3/4) × 12 = 9 slices.**
- **Total slices eaten by these two = 2 people × 9 slices = 18 slices.**

**Total Slices Eaten:**
- **24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (remaining two friends) = 42 slices.**

**Slices Left:**
- **Total slices = 60**
- **Slices eaten = 42**
- **Slices left = 60 - 42 = 18 slices.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{18}
