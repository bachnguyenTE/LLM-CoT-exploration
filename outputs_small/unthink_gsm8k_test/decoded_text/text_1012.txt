Q: Maria was charging her power bank before going to the park when she disconnected it and noticed the power bank wasn’t fully charged yet. Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends’ phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went to the park.

1. **Initial Charge at the Park:**
   - Let \( C \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria disconnected it.

2. **First 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank loses **9%** of its total capacity each hour.
   - **After 1 hour:** \( C - 0.09C = 0.91C \)
   - **After 2 hours:** \( 0.91 \times 0.91C = 0.8281C \)
   - **After 3 hours:** \( 0.91^3C \)
   - **After 4 hours:** \( 0.91^4C \)
   - **After 5 hours:** \( 0.91^5C \)

3. **Next 3 Hours:**
   - After the first 5 hours, the power bank starts losing **7%** of its capacity each hour.
   - **After 1 hour:** \( 0.91^5C - 0.07 \times 0.91^5C = 0.91^5C \times (1 - 0.07) = 0.91^5 \times 0.93C \)
   - **After 2 hours:** \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93C \times 0.93 \)
   - **After 3 hours:** \( 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3C \)

4. **Final Charge:**
   - After 3 hours, the remaining charge is **28%** of the original capacity.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \times C = 0.28C
     \]
   - To find \( C \), we can rearrange:
     \[
     C = \frac{0.28}{0.91^5 \times 0.93^3}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Values:**
   - First, calculate \( 0.91^5 \):
     \[
     0.91^5 \approx 0.62403
     \]
   - Then, calculate \( 0.93^3 \):
     \[
     0.93^3 \approx 0.804357
     \]
   - Multiply them together:
     \[
     0.62403 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5016
     \]
   - Now, calculate \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{0.28}{0.5016} \approx 0.558
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{0.558}
   \]
