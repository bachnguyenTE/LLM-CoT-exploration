Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Sunny earned for the two days.

### **Given:**
- **Sunny** sold gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.
- **Saturday:**
  - Sold **10 boxes of gingerbread**.
  - Sold **4 fewer boxes of apple pie** than on Sunday.
- **Sunday:**
  - Sold **5 more boxes of gingerbread** than on Saturday.
  - Sold **15 boxes of apple pie**.
- **Costs:**
  - Gingerbread: \$6 per box.
  - Apple pie: \$15 per box.

### **Step 1: Determine the Number of Boxes Sold Each Day**

Let's denote:
- \( G_{\text{Sat}} \) = Number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday.
- \( A_{\text{Sat}} \) = Number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.
- \( G_{\text{Sun}} \) = Number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday.
- \( A_{\text{Sun}} \) = Number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday.

From the problem:
- \( G_{\text{Sat}} = 10 \) (given).
- \( A_{\text{Sat}} = A_{\text{Sun}} - 4 \) (sold 4 fewer on Saturday than Sunday).
- \( G_{\text{Sun}} = G_{\text{Sat}} + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (sold 5 more on Sunday).
- \( A_{\text{Sun}} = 15 \) (given).

Now, we can find \( A_{\text{Sat}} \):
\[
A_{\text{Sat}} = A_{\text{Sun}} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate Total Boxes Sold Each Day**

- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes.
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes.
  
- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes.
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes.

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Each Item**

- **Gingerbread Earnings:**
  \[
  \text{Total Gingerbread} = (\text{G}_{\text{Sat}} + \text{G}_{\text{Sun}}) \times \text{Cost per box} = (10 + 15) \times 6 = 25 \times 6 = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]
  
- **Apple Pie Earnings:**
  \[
  \text{Total Apple Pie} = (\text{A}_{\text{Sat}} + \text{A}_{\text{Sun}}) \times \text{Cost per box} = (11 + 15) \times 15 = 26 \times 15 = 390 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### **Step 4: Calculate Total Earnings for Two Days**

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Gingerbread Earnings} + \text{Apple Pie Earnings} = 150 + 390 = 540 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
