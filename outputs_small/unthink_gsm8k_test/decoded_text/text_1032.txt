Q: Grandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes **75 large jelly beans** to fill Grandpa up.
   - So, **Large beans = 75**.

2. **Medium-Sized Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat **twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans**.
   - Therefore, **Medium beans = 2 × Large beans = 2 × 75 = 150**.

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating **3 small beans** is the same as eating **1 medium-sized bean**.
   - So, **3 small beans = 1 medium bean**.
   - To find out how many small beans correspond to **1 medium bean**, we can rearrange this:
     \[
     1 \text{ medium bean} = 3 \text{ small beans}
     \]
   - Therefore, **1 medium bean = 3 small beans**.

4. **Total Small Beans Grandpa Can Eat:**
   - Since Grandpa can eat **150 medium beans**, and each medium bean is equivalent to **3 small beans**:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{450}
\]
