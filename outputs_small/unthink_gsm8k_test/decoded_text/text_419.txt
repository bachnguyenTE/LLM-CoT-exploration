Q: Stanley was standing on the side of the mountain, at an elevation of 10,000 feet, when a gust air blew the comb out of his pocket, causing the comb to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below.  Stanley's brother, Oliver, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb.  How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb.

1. **Initial Elevation of Stanley's Com:**
   - Stanley is standing at an elevation of **10,000 feet**.

2. **Distance the Com fell:**
   - The comb fell **4,000 feet** to a ledge below.

3. **Elevation of Stanley's Com After Falling:**
   - Stanley's comb is now at **10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet**.

4. **Elevation of Oliver's Position:**
   - Oliver is at an elevation of **3,000 feet**.

5. **Distance Oliver Needs to Climb:**
   - To reach Stanley's comb, Oliver needs to climb from **3,000 feet** to **6,000 feet**.
   - **Climb required = Stanley's comb elevation - Oliver's elevation**
   - **Climb required = 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{3000}
