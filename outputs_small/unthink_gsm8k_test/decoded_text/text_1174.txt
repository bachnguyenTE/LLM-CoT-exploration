Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many \$5 bills Thomas has at the end.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   - Thomas withdraws **\$1000** in \$20 bills.
   - Number of \$20 bills = \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Bills Lost While Getting Home:**
   - Thomas loses **10 bills**.
   - Remaining bills after losing: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   - Thomas uses **half of the remaining bills** to pay for a bill.
   - Number of bills used = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - Remaining bills after using: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) bills.

4. **Tripling His Money:**
   - Thomas triples his **remaining money**.
   - Total money after tripling: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) bills.

5. **Converting Bills to \$5 Bills:**
   - Thomas converts all his bills to \$5 bills.
   - Number of \$5 bills = \( \frac{60}{5} = 12 \) bills.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
