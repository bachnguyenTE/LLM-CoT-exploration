Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. The number of rabbits is **12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.**
2. **There are two cats for every dog.**
3. **The number of dogs is 60.**

**Let’s define the variables:**
- Let \( D \) = number of dogs.
- Let \( C \) = number of cats.
- Let \( R \) = number of rabbits.

**Step 1: Determine the number of cats.**
Since there are **two cats for every dog**, we can express the number of cats as:
\[
C = 2 \times D
\]
Given that \( D = 66 \):
\[
C = 2 \times 66 = 132
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats.**
\[
D + C = 66 + 132 = 198
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of rabbits.**
The number of rabbits is **12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats**:
\[
R = (D + C) - 12 = 198 - 12 = 186
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pets.**
\[
\text{Total pets} = D + C + R = 66 + 132 + 186 = 384
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{384}
\]
