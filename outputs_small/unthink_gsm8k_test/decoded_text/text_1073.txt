Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total bananas bought by Mr. Robles:** 315 bananas
- **Number of monkeys:** 3
- **Feeding period:** 1 week (7 days)
- **Eating rates:**
  - **First monkey:** 10 bananas per day
  - **Second monkey:** 4 more bananas than the first monkey
  - **Third monkey:** Eats the remaining bananas for the day

**Step 1: Calculate the total bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.**

- **First monkey:** 10 bananas/day
- **Second monkey:** 10 + 4 = 14 bananas/day

Total for the first two monkeys:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 14 \text{ bananas/day} = 24 \text{ bananas/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of bananas left for the third monkey each day.**

Total bananas bought:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

Bananas consumed by the first two monkeys:
\[ 24 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Bananas left for the third monkey:
\[ 315 - 24 = 291 \text{ bananas/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day.**

Since the third monkey eats the remaining bananas for the day:
\[ 291 \text{ bananas/day} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{291}
\]
