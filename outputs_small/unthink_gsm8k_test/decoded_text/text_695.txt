**Solution:**

We start with **50 deer** in the field. **50 percent** of these deer are bucks. To find the number of bucks, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 55 \times 0.5 = 27.5
\]

Since we can't have half a buck, we'll consider **27 bucks** (assuming partial bucks are not counted).

Next, **20 percent** of the bucks are **8-point bucks**. To find the number of 8-point bucks:

\[
\text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 27 \times \frac{20}{100} = 27 \times 0.2 = 5.4
\]

Again, we can't have a fraction of a buck, so we'll round down to **5 8-point bucks**.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
