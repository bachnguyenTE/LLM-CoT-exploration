**Solution:**

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we'll calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - **Original Price:** \$9,000
   - **Depreciation Rate:** 30%
   - **Depreciation Amount:** \( 9,000 \times 0.30 = 2,700 \)
   - **Value After First Year:** \( 9,000 - 2,700 = 6,300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - **Value at Start of Second Year:** \$6,300
   - **Depreciation Rate:** 30%
   - **Depreciation Amount:** \( 6,300 \times0.30 = 1,890 \)
   - **Value After Second Year:** \( 6,300 - 1,890 = 4,410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - **Value at Start of Third Year:** \$4,410
   - **Depreciation Rate:** 20%
   - **Depreciation Amount:** \( 4,410 \times0.20 = 922.20 \)
   - **Value After Third Year:** \( 4,410 - 922.20 = 3,487.80 \)

**Final Value of the Boat After Three Years:**
\[
\boxed{3,\!487.80}
\]
