Q: Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?

**Solution:**

Manny has signed up for Karate classes for a total of **10 classes** and paid **\$60**. His parents have set a condition: if the cost per class exceeds **\$10**, he won't sign him up again. We need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds **\$10**.

1. **Calculate the current cost per class:**
   
   \[
   \text{Current cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   
   \[
   \text{Maximum allowable cost per class} = \$10
   \]

3. **Find the number of classes Manny can miss:**
   
   \[
   \text{Number of classes he can miss} = \frac{\$60}{\$10 \text{ per class}} = 6 \text{ classes}
   \]

**Answer:** Manny can miss **6 classes** before his parents decide he won't sign him up again.
