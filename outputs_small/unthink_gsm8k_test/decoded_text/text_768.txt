**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   
   - It's given that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.
   - Therefore, \( 2A \) represents the number of books Ezra read.
   - We are told that Ezra read **300 books** in that hour.
   
   So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2A = 300
   \]
   
   Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   
   Therefore, Ahmed read **150 books** in that hour.

2. **Calculate the total number of books read by both:**
   
   - **Ezra read 300 books.**
   - **Ahmed read 150 books.**
   
   Adding these together:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 455
   \]
   
3. **Consider the additional books Ezra decided to read:**
   
   - It's mentioned that Ezra decided to read **150 more** books.
   
   Adding these to the previous total:
   \[
   455 + 150 = 605
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{605}
\]
