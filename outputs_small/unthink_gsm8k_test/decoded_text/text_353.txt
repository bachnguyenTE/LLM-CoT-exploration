Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much time John spent sightseeing.

1. **Boating Time:**
   - John spent **6 hours** boating.

2. **Swimming Time:**
   - He spent **half** the time he spent boating swimming.
   - **Swimming Time** = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) hours = **3 hours**

3. **Watching Shows:**
   - He watched **3 different shows**, each lasting **2 hours**.
   - **Total Watching Time** = \( 3 \times 2 \) hours = **6 hours**

4. **Total Time Spent:**
   - **Total Time** = Boating Time + Swimming Time + Watching Time
   - **Total Time** = \( 6 + 3 + 6 \) hours = **15 hours**

5. **Showing 30% of His Time Was Watching Shows:**
   - **30% of Total Time** = 6 hours
   - Let \( T \) be the total time spent.
   - \( 0.30T = 6 \) hours
   - \( T = \frac{6}{0.30} \) hours ≈ **19.61 hours**

6. **Sightseeing Time:**
   - **Sightseeing Time** is **30%** of the total time.
   - **Sightseeing Time** = \( 0.30 \times 19.61 \) \) hours ≈ **6.0 hours**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6\text{ hours}}
\]
