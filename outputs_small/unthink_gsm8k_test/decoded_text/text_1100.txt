**Solution:**

To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent on lunch and break:**
   - **Lunch:** 30 minutes
   - **Break:** 2 and 15 minutes (which is 2 minutes + 15 minutes = 25 minutes)
   - **Total daily time:** 30 minutes + 25 minutes = 35 minutes

2. **Calculate the total time over 5 days:**
   - **Total time:** 35 minutes/day × 5 days = 175 minutes

3. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - **175 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2.91666... hours**

4. **Express the result as a fraction:**
   - **2.91666... hours = 2 and 11/12 hours**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{2\frac{1}{12}\text{ hours}}
