Q: Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?

To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.**
   
   - A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6.
   - Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are **3** favorable outcomes.
   - Total possible outcomes = 6.
   
   So, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
   \[
   P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.**
   
   - Even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - Probability of rolling an even number on one roll:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{even, then even}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
     \]

3. **Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to two even numbers in a row.**
   
   - To find how much more likely one event is compared to another, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Increase in likelihood} = \left( \frac{\text{New probability}}{\text{Original probability}} - 1 \right) \times 100\%
     \]
   
   - Here, the new probability is \( P(\text{greater than 3}) = 0.5 \), and the original probability is \( P(\text{even, then even}) = 0.25 \).
   
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Increase in likelihood} = \left( \frac{0.5}{0.25} - 1 \right) \times 100\% = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{100\%}
\]
