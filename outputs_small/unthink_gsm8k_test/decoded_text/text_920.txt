Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pets Larry has.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   - Larry has **3 cats**.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   - He has **3 times as many dogs as cats**.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) dogs.

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   - He has **2 fewer rabbits than dogs**.
   - Calculation: \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) rabbits.

4. **Number of Fish:**
   - He has **three times the number of fish as rabbits**.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) fish.

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   - He has **1/3 the number of fish as rabbits**.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7 \) gerbils.

6. **Total Number of Pets:**
   - **Cats + Dogs + Rabbits + Fish + Gerbils**
   - Calculation: \( 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 \) pets.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{47}
