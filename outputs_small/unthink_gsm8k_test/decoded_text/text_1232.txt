Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Eve had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving her friend some pomelos, Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pomelos she originally had. How many pomelos did Eve give away?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of pomelos Eve is left with:**
   
   Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
   
   She is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of these pomelos.
   
   \[
   \text{Pomelos left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pomelos Eve gave away:**
   
   Eve started with 20 pomelos and is left with 5.
   
   \[
   \text{Pomelos given away} = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Eve gave away \(\boxed{15}\) pomelos.
