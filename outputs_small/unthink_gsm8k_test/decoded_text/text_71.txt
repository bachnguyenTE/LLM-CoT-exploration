**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of instructions for each recipe:**
   - **First recipe:** 20 instructions.
   - **Second recipe:** Twice as many instructions as the first one.

2. **Calculate the number of instructions for the second recipe:**
   \[
   \text{Instructions for second recipe} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read:**
   \[
   \text{Total instructions} = \text{Instructions for first recipe} + \text{Instructions for second recipe} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]
