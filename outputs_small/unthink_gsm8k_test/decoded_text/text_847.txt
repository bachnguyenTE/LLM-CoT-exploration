**Solution:**

To determine how much Brenda will have in total after 3 years, we'll use the formula for simple interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time})
\]

1. **Principal (P):** \$300
2. **Rate (R):** Three-quarters of the original amount per year.
   \[
   R = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75\%
   \]
3. **Time (T):** 3 years

Now, plug the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 300 + (300 \times 0.75 \times 3)
\]

Calculate the interest:

\[
300 \times 0.75 = 225
\]
\[
225 \times 3 = 675
\]

Add the interest to the principal:

\[
300 + 675 = 975
\]

**Final Answer:** Brenda will have **\$975** in total after 3 years.
