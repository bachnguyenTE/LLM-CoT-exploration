**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Sean has 56 marbles.
   - Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   - Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

2. **Find:**
   - The total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**

   - **Step 1:** Determine how many marbles Carl has.
     - Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
     - Sean has 56 marbles.
     - So, Carl's marbles = 4 × 56 = **224 marbles**.

   - **Step 2:** Determine how many marbles Cal has.
     - Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
     - Sean has 56 marbles.
     - So, Cal's marbles = 2 × 56 = **112 marbles**.

   - **Step 3:** Calculate the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have.
     - Carl has 224 marbles.
     - Cal has 112 marbles.
     - Combined marbles = 224 + 112 = **336 marbles**.

**Final Answer:**
