**Solution:**

John buys a cassette with 2 songs. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song.

1. **Calculate the length of the second song:**
   
   \[
   \text{Length of second song} = 5\ \text{minutes} + 60\% \times 5\ \text{minutes}
   \]
   
   \[
   60\% \times 5 = 0.6 \times 5 = 3\ \text{minutes}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Length of second song} = 5 + 3 = 8\ \text{minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total length of the cassette:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total length} = \text{Length of first song} + \text{Length of second song}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total length} = 5\ \text{minutes} + 8\ \text{minutes} = 13\ \text{minutes}
   \]

**Answer:** The total time of the cassette is \(\boxed{13}\) minutes.
