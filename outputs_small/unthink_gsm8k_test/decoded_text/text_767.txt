To determine how much money Sam would need to make 4 liters of juice, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of oranges needed for 1 liter of juice:**
   
   - 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges.

2. **Calculate the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice:**
   
   - For 4 liters, multiply the amount needed for 1 liter by 4:
     \[
     5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg of oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:**
   
   - Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
   - Multiply the total kilograms by the cost per kilogram:
     \[
     20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
Sam would need to spend \$60 to make 4 liters of juice.
