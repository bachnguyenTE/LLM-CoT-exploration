Q: When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of Marcus's house.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   - Marcus's house starts at **40 degrees**.

2. **Baking Time:**
   - Marcus spends **3 hours** baking.
   - **5 degrees increase per hour** when the oven is on.
   - **Total temperature increase during baking:** 
     \[
     5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \,0000 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{degrees}
     \]
   - **Temperature after baking:**
     \[
     40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} = 55 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

3. **Window开放:**
   - **Window is open for 30 minutes.**
   - **Cooling rate:** The house cools **2 degrees** for every **10 minutes** of window open.
   - **Temperature decrease during window open:**
     \[
     \frac{2 \, \text{degrees}}{10 \, \text{minutes}} \times 30 \, \text{minutes} = 6 \, \text{degrees}
     \]
   - **Final temperature after cooling:**
     \[
     55 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

**Final Temperature of the House:**
\[
\boxed{49^\circ \text{F}}
\]
