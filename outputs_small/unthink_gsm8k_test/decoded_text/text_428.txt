Q: A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare **gourmet hot dogs** for **36 guests**.
   - Most people would only eat **1 hotdog**, but he prepared enough for **half of the guests** to have **2 hotdogs**.

2. **Calculating the Initial Hotdogs:**
   - **Half of 36 guests** = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have **2 hotdogs**.
   - **Total hotdogs prepared initially** = \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.

3. **Guests Who Actually Arrived:**
   - **40 guests** showed up unexpectedly.

4. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - Each of the 40 guests wanted **2 hotdogs**.
   - **Total hotdogs needed** = \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) hotdogs.

5. **Available Hotdogs:**
   - The caterer had prepared **36 hotdogs** initially.

6. **Shortage of Hotdogs:**
   - **Available hotdogs** = 36
   - **Needed hotdogs** = 80
   - **Shortage** = \( 80 - 36 = 44 \) hotdogs.

7. **Guests Who Did Not Get a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since the caterer had prepared enough for 36 hotdogs, and 44 hotdogs were short, **44 guests** did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
