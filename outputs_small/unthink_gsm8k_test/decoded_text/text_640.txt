To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Base Price of the Truck:**
   \[
   \$30,\!000
   \]

2. **Additional Features:**
   - **King Cab Upgrade:** \$7,500
   - **Towing Package:** Extra cost
   - **Leather Seats:** Extra cost
   - **Running Boards:** \$500 less than the cost of leather seats
   - **Upgraded Exterior Light Package:** \$1,500

3. **Calculating Each Feature:**
   - **King Cab Upgrade:** \$7,500
   - **Leather Seats:** Let’s denote the cost of the king cab upgrade as \( K = \$7,500 \). The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
     \[
     \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times K = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,\!500 = \$2,\!500
     \]
   - **Running Boards:** \$500 less than the cost of leather seats.
     \[
     \text{Running Boards} = \text{Leather Seats} - \$500 = 2,\!500 - 500 = \$2,\!000
     \]
   - **Upgraded Exterior Light Package:** \$1,500

4. **Total Additional Costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = K + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Light Package} = 7,\!500 + 2,\!500 + 2,\!000 + 1,\!500 = \$13,\!600
   \]

5. **Total Cost of the Truck:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{Total Additional Costs} = 30,\!000 + 13,\!600 = \$43,\!600
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{43600}
\]
