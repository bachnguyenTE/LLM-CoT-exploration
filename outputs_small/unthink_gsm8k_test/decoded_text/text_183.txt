Q: Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?

To determine how much faster the **faster team** wins compared to the **less well-rounded team**, let's analyze both teams' performance step by step.

### **Faster Team:**
- **Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.**
- **Total distance of the relay:** 4 × 400 meters = 1600 meters.
- **Total time for the team:** 4 × 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

### **Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- **First runner:** 60 seconds for 400 meters.
- **Subsequent runners:** Each runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

Let's calculate the time each runner takes:

1. **First Runner:** 60 seconds.
2. **Second Runner:** 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
3. **Third Runner:** 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
4. **Fourth Runner:** 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

**Total time for the team:** 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = **178 seconds.**

### **Difference in Times:**
- **Faster Team's Time:** 220 seconds.
- **Less Well-Rounded Team's Time:** 178 seconds.
- **Difference:** 220 - 178 = **44 seconds.**

**Conclusion:** The **faster team** wins by **44 seconds.**

\boxed{44}
