2. **First Movement:**
   - She fell back **5 spots**.
   - **Calculation:** \(1 - 5 = -4\)
   - Since positions are numbered from **1**, a negative result indicates she moved ahead.
   - **Final Position:** \(100 - 5 = 95\)
   - **Result:** She is **95th**.

3. **Second Movement:**

   - **Final Position:** \(97\)
   - **Result:** She is **97th**.

4. **Third Movement:**
   - She fell behind **3 spots**.
   - **Calculation:** \(97 - 3 = 94\)
   - **Final Position:** \(94\)
