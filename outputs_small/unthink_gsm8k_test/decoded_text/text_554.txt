Q: When the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Cold Day:**
  - Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
- **Warm Day:**
  - Ray swims 1 mile in **2 minutes more than twice as long** as he swims on a cold day.

**Objective:**
- Determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a **hot day** compared to a **cold day**.

**Step 1: Calculate Ray's swimming speed on a cold day.**

- **Cold Day:**
  - Distance = 1 mile
  - Time = 16 minutes
  - **Speed** = Distance / Time = 1 mile / 16 minutes ≈ 0.1667 miles per minute

**Step 2: Determine the time taken to swim 1 mile on a warm day.**

- **Warm Day:**
  - **Time for 1 mile** = 2 minutes + 2*(Time on cold day)
  - Let’s denote the time on a cold day as \( t \) minutes.
  - So, **Time on warm day** = \( 2 + 2t \) minutes.

**Step 3: Find the time taken to swim 1 mile on a warm day.**

- From the cold day data:
  - \( t = 16 \) minutes
  - **Time on warm day** = \( 2 + 2*16 = 2 + 12 = 14 \) minutes

**Step 4: Calculate the time taken to swim 3 miles on a cold day.**

- **Cold Day:**
  - Time per mile = 16 minutes
  - Total time = 3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate the time taken to swim 3 miles on a warm day.**

- **Warm Day:**
  - Time per mile = 14 minutes
  - Total time = 3 miles * 14 minutes/mile = 42 minutes

**Step 6: Determine the difference in time between a warm day and a cold day for swimming 3 miles.**

- **Difference** = Time on warm day - Time on cold day
- **Difference** = 42 minutes - 48 minutes = -6 minutes

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because the difference should be positive. Let's re-examine the calculations.

**Re-examining Step 2:**

- **Time on warm day** = 2 minutes + 2*(Time on cold day)
- Given that on a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes, so:
  - **Time on warm day** = 2 + 2*16 = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes

**Corrected Step 5:**

- **Warm Day:**
  - Time per mile = 34 minutes
  - Total time = 3 miles * 34 minutes/mile = 102 minutes

- **Cold Day:**
  - Total time = 3 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 48 minutes

**Final Step 6:**

- **Difference** = 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

**Final Answer:**

Ray takes **54 minutes longer** to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

\boxed{54}
