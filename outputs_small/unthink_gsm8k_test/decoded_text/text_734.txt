To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Cindy's Books:**
   - **Math Books:** 2 pounds each
   - **Science Books:** 2 pounds each
   - **French Book:** 4 pounds
   - **English Book:** 3 pounds
   - **History Book:** Twice as heavy as the **English Book**, so \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) pounds

2. **Total Weight Calculation:**
   - **Math Books:** \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) pounds
   - **Science Books:** \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) pounds
   - **French Book:** 4 pounds
   - **English Book:** 3 pounds
   - **History Book:** 6 pounds

   Adding all these together:
   \[
   4 \, (\text{Math}) + 4 \, \! \text{(Science)} + 4 \, (\text{French}) + 3 \, \! \text{(English)} + 6 \, (\text{History}) = 21 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{21}\) pounds
