**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total dinner bill:**
   \[
   \$50
   \]

2. **Calculate the 20% tip:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } \$50 = 0.20 \times 50 = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Add the tip to the original bill:**
   \[
   \$50 + \$1.00 = \$51.00
   \]

4. **Divide the total amount (including tip) by 2 to split the bill evenly:**
   \[
   \frac{\$51.00}{2} = \$25.50
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$25.50}
\]
