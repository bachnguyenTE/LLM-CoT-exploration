**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the savings for the ice cream:**
   - **Original price per tub:** \$13
   - **Selling price per tub:** \$11
   - **Savings per tub:** \$13 - \$11 = \$12
   - **Total savings for 2 tubs:** 2 × \$12 = **\$24**

2. **Calculate the savings for the milk:**
   - **Original price per packet of milk:** \$0.5 (Assuming the original price is \$1, as there's no discount mentioned)
   - **Selling price per packet of milk:** \$1 - \$0.5 = **\$0.5**
   - **Savings per packet of milk:** \$0.5
   - **Total savings for 4 packets of milk:** 4 × \$0.5 = **\$2**

3. **Total savings:**
   - **Savings from ice cream:** \$24
   - **Savings from milk:** \$2
   - **Total savings:** \$24 + \$2 = **\$26**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\$26}
