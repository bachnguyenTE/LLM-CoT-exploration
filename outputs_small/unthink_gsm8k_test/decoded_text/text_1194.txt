To determine the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, follow these steps:

1. **Blood Volume of a Whale:**
   - Each whale has **40 gallons** of blood.

2. **Blood Volume of a Shark:**
   - A shark has **three times** as much blood as a whale.
   - **Shark's blood volume = 3 × Whale's blood volume**
   - **Shark's blood volume = 3 × 40 gallons = 120 gallons**

3. **Total Blood Volume for Ten Sharks:**
   - **Total blood = Number of sharks × Blood volume per shark**
   - **Total blood = 10 × 120 gallons = 1200 gallons**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{1200}
