Q: Nate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many weeks it takes for Nate to fill all the holes.

### **Given:**
- **Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.**
- **Nate digs for 14 days while on vacation.**
- **After returning, Nate starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes per day.**
- **The dog continues digging 6 holes every night.**

### **Objective:**
Determine the total number of weeks required to fill all the holes.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Holes dug by the Dog**

- **Dogs digs for 14 days.**
- **Holes dug per day = 6.**

\[
\text{Total holes dug} = 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes}
\]

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Net Rate of Hole Creation**

- **Nate fills holes at a rate of 9 holes per day.**
- **The dog digs 6 holes per night.**

\[
\text{Net rate} = \text{Filling rate} - \text{Dropping rate} = 9 \, \text{holes/day} - 6 \, \text{holes/day} = 3 \, \text{holes/day}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Time to Fill All Holes**

- **Total holes to fill = 84 holes.**
- **Net rate = 3 holes/day.**

\[
\text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Convert Days to Weeks**

- **1 week = 7 days.**

\[
\text{Total weeks} = \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 3.714 \, \text{weeks}
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3.714 \, \text{weeks}}
\]

---

**Note:** The exact value is approximately **3.714 weeks**, which can be rounded to **3.7 weeks** for practical purposes.
