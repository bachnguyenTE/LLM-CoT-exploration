To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total cups of water consumed in 30 days:**
   
   Ingrid drinks 8 cups every day.
   
   \[
   8 \text{ cups/day} \times 33 \text{ days} = 264 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Convert cups to gallons:**
   
   There are 16 cups in a gallon.
   
   \[
   \frac{264 \text{ cups}}{6 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 44 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
