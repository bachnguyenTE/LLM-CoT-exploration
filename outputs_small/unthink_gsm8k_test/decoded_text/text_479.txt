To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, let's break down the expenses step by step.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs \$5,000 (assuming a typo, as the original amount seems to be in Indian Rupees, but it's unclear if it's \$5,000 or \$5,000. For the sake of this calculation, we'll consider it as \$5,000.)

   - **Total for Two Tickets:** 
     \[
     2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price because it's a busy weekend.
   - **Normal Price per Day:** \$1,500

   - **Increased Price per Day:**
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$1,500 = 0.10 \times 1,500 = \$150
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Price per Day} = \$1,500 + \$150 = \$1,700
     \]

   - **Total for Three Days:**
     \[
     3 \times \$1,700 = \$5,100
     \]

3. **Total Trip Cost:**
   - **Sum of Plane Tickets and Hotel Cost:**
     \[
     \$10,000 + \$5,100 = \$15,100
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$15,\!100}
\]
