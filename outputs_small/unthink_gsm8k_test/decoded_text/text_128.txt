**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of a pepper:**
   - Given that each pepper costs **\$15**.

2. **Find the cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs **3 times** what each pepper costs.
   - **Watermelon cost = 3 × Pepper cost = 3 × \$15 = \$45**.

3. **Determine the cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs **\$5 less** than a watermelon.
   - **Orange cost = Watermelon cost - \$5 = \$45 - \$5 = \$40**.

4. **Calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase:**
   - **Watermelons:** 4 × \$45 = \$180
   - **Peppers:** 20 × \$15 = \$100
   - **Oranges:** 10 × \$40 = \$400

5. **Sum up all the costs:**
   - **Total cost = \$180 + \$100 + \$440 = \$720**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{720}
\]
