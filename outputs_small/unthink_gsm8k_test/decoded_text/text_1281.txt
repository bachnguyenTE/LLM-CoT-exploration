**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total feed consumed by one pig in a week:**
   - Each pig eats **4 pounds of feed** twice a day.
   - **Daily consumption per pig:** \( 4 \text{ pounds/day} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \).
   - **Weekly consumption per pig:** \( 8 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pounds/week} \).

2. **Calculate the total feed consumed by all five pigs in a week:**
   - **Total weekly consumption:** \( 56 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 300 \text{ pounds/week} \).

3. **Determine the remaining feed after one week:**
   - **Initial order:** \( 300 \text{ pounds} \).
   - **Remaining feed:** \( 300 \text{ pounds} - 300 \text{ pounds} = 0 \text{ pounds} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0}
