**Solution:**

Arianna has a garden with **10 rows of flowers**, and each row contains **20 flowers**. To find the total number of flowers in the garden, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers}
\]

Currently, **\(\frac{4}{5}\)** of these flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we calculate:

\[
\text{Bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{160}\)
