Q: Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon:**
   - Lemons cost \$3.
   - Sugar costs \$2.
   - **Total cost per gallon = \$3 + \$2 = \$5.**

2. **Calculate the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - **Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses × \$0.50 per glass = \$11.00.**

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - **Profit per gallon = Revenue - Cost = \$11.00 - \$5.00 = -\$4.00.**
   - Wait, this results in a loss. Let's double-check the calculations.

4. **Re-evaluate the profit calculation:**
   - **Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses × \$0.50 = \$10.00.**
   - **Profit per gallon = \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00.**

5. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a total profit of \$25:**
   - **Number of gallons = Total profit / Profit per gallon = \$25.00 / \$5.00 = 1 gallon.**

6. **Calculate the amount spent on lemons:**
   - **Total cost per gallon = \$5.00.**
   - **Amount spent on lemons = \$5.00.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$5.00}
