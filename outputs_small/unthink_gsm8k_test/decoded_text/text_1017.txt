**Solution:**

Olivia uploaded a total of **72 pictures** to Facebook and distributed them equally into **8 albums**. Each album received the same number of pictures. 

1. **Total number of pictures:** 72  
2. **Total number of albums:** 8  

To find out how many pictures are in each album, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

So, each album contains **9 pictures**.

Next, we need to determine how many of these pictures are portraits and how many are selfies.

- **3 albums are selfies only.**  
- **2 albums are portraits only.**  
- The remaining albums are neither selfies nor portraits.

First, calculate the number of albums that are neither selfies nor portraits:

\[
\text{Total albums} - \text{Selfie albums} - \text{Portraits} = 8 - 3 - 2 = 3
\]

So, **3 albums** are neither selfies nor portraits.

Now, calculate the total number of selfies:

\[
\text{Total selfies} = \text{Number of selfie albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

Similarly, calculate the total number of portraits:

\[
\text{Total portraits} = \text{Number of portrait albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**

Olivia had **18 portraits** and **27 selfies**.

\[
\boxed{18 \text{ portraits and } 27 \text{ selfies}}
\]
