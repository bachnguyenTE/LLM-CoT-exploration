**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Grace's Weight:**
   - Grace weighs **125 pounds**.

2. **Alex's Weight:**
   - Alex weighs **2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs**.
   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Then, subtract 2 pounds:
     \[
     500 - 2 = 500 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, Alex weighs **500 pounds**.

3. **Combined Weight:**
   - Add Grace's and Alex's weights together:
     \[
     125 + 500 = 625 \text{ pounds}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{625}
\]
