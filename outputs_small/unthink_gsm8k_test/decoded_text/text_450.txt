Q: You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the **regular price of popcorn**.
   - The **regular price of soda** is given as \$3.

2. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - **Cost:** \$20 (includes a movie and one popcorn with a soda).
   - **Total cost for super ticket:** \$20.

3. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - **Cost per ticket:** \$12.
   - **Cost for popcorn and soda:** \( P + 3 \).

4. **Total Cost for Regular Tickets:**
   - If you buy one ticket, one popcorn, and one soda, the total cost is:
     \[
     12 + P + 3 = 15 + P
     \]

5. **Savings:**
   - You saved \$2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is:
     \[
     20 + 2 = 22
     \]

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total cost without the super ticket equals the total cost with the regular ticket:
     \[
     15 + P = 22
     \]

7. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   P = 22 - 15 = 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
