**Solution:**

1. **Original Distance Tyson Runs:**
   - Tyson runs **5000 meters** every day.

2. **Increase in Distance:**
   - The coach wants him to run **1/5 times more meters**.
   - **1/5 of 5000 meters** is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1100 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - **Total Distance with the Increase**:
     \[
     5500 + 1100 = 6600 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Total Distance in June:**
   - June has **30 days**.
   - **Total Distance**:
     \[
     6600 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 198,000 \text{ meters}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{198,\!000 \text{ meters}}
\]
