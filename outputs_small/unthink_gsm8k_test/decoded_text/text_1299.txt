Let's break down Janet's expenses step by step:

1. **Ice Cream:**
   - **Cost:** \$3.50

2. **Movie Tickets:**
   - **Cost per ticket:** \$7.50
   - **Number of tickets:** 2 (for herself and her younger sister)
   - **Total for tickets:** \( 2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00 \)

3. **Bracelet:**
   - **Cost:** \$8.50

**Total Expenses:**

\$3.50 + \$15.00 + \$8.50 = \$27.00

\$40.00 - \$27.00 = \$17.00
\]

**Final Answer:**
