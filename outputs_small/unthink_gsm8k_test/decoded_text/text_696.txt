Q: Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?

To determine how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   - Adam has collected **50 points**.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected **30% more** than Adam.
   - **Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points**
   - **Betty's points = 55 + (0.30 × 55) = 55 + 16.5 = 71.5 points**
   - Since points are typically whole numbers, we'll consider **72 points** for Betty.

3. **Betty and Tom's Relationship:**
   - Betty has **30 points more** than Tom.
   - **Tom's points = Betty's points - 30**
   - **Tom's points = 72 - 30 = 39 points**

4. **Marta's Points:**
   - Marta collected **3 times** more points than Tom.
   - **Marta's points = 3 × Tom's points**
   - **Marta's points = 3 × 39 = 117 points**

5. **Total Points Collected by the Class:**
   - **Total = Adam + Martha + Betty + Tom**
   - **Total = 55 + 117 + 72 + 39 = 283 points**

6. **Points Needed to Reach the Trip Threshold:**
   - **Minimum threshold = 440 points**
   - **Points missing = 440 - 283 = 357 points**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{357}
