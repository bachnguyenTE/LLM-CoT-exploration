**Solution:**

Baldur gets water from a well in the morning and afternoon. Here's the breakdown:

- **Morning:** 5 pails
- **Afternoon:** 6 pails

Each pail contains **5 liters** of water.

**Total Water in the Morning:**
\[
5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters}
\]

**Total Water in the Afternoon:**
\[
6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters}
\]

**Total Water Every Day:**
\[
25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{55 \text{ liters}}
\]
