Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade.

**Given:**
- Tim grows **5 trees**.
- Each year, he collects **6 lemons** from each tree.

**Question:**
How many lemons does Tim get in a **decade** (10 years)?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in a year:**
   \[
   6 \text{ lemons/tree/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year:**
   \[
   5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected over 10 years (a decade):**
   \[
   30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{300}
\]
