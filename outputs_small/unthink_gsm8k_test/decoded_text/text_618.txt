Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many students were in the school auditorium.

1. **Total Seats in the Auditorium:**
   - There are **4 rows** of seats.
   - Each row has **18 seats**.
   - **Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats.**

2. **Seats Occupied by the Administrators:**
   - **One-fourth of the seats** were occupied by the administrators.
   - **Seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) × 72 = 18 seats.**

3. **Remaining Seats:**
   - **Total seats - seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.**

4. **Seats Occupied by the Parents:**
   - **One-third of the remaining seats** were occupied by the parents.
   - **Seats occupied by parents = (1/3) × 54 = 18 seats.**

5. **Seats Occupied by the Students:**
   - **The rest of the seats** were occupied by the students.
   - **Seats occupied by students = Total remaining seats - seats occupied by parents = 54 - 18 = 36 seats.**

6. **Final Answer:**
   - **Number of students in the school auditorium = 36.**

\boxed{36}
