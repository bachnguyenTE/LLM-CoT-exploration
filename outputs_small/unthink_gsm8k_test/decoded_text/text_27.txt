**Solution:**

Cynthia eats **1 serving** of ice cream every night. She buys **15 servings** per carton, costing **\$4.00** per carton.

1. **Calculate servings needed for 60 days:**
   \[
   60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 66 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine how many cartons she needs:**
   \[
   \frac{66 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4.4 \text{ cartons}
   \]
   Since she can't buy a fraction of a carton, she needs to purchase **5 cartons**.

3. **Calculate total cost:**
   \[
   5 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$20.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\$20.00}
