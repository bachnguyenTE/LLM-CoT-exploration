Q: Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces.  How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Lego Set:**
   - **Number of pieces:** 500

2. **Second Lego Set:**
   - This set has **3 times more pieces** than the first one.
   - Calculation: \( 500 \times 3 = 1500 \) pieces

3. **Third Lego Set:**
   - This set has **1/4 the number of pieces** as the first one.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{500}{4} = 125 \) pieces

4. **Total Number of Legos Johnny Picks Up:**
   - Add up all the pieces from the three sets.
   - Calculation: \( 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2175 \) pieces

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2175}
\]
