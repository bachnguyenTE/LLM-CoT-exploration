Q: Shania is designing her own dress, and decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?

**Solution:**

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

1. **Extension by 50%:**
   - The dress is extended by 50% of its original length.
   - **Extended length:** \( x + 0.50x = 1.50x \) cm.

2. **Adding 20 cm with lace trim:**
   - An additional 20 cm is added to the bottom.
   - **Final length:** \( 1.50x + 20 = 140 \) cm.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   \[
   1.50x + 20 = 140
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   1.50x = 140 - 20 \\
   1.50x = 120 \\
   x = \frac{120}{1.50} \\
   x = 78.26 \text{ cm}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{78.26\ \text{cm}}
\]
