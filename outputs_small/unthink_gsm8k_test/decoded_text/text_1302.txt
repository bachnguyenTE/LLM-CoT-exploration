Q: Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. If Matthew would agree to that offer, how much money would he earn?

**Solution:**

Matthew has a total of **12 unique toy soldiers**.

He wants to sell them to a buyer in two groups:
1. **First half:** The buyer is willing to pay **\$5** per toy.
2. **Second half:** The buyer is willing to pay **\$7** per toy.

Since there are **12** soldiers in total, we'll divide them equally into two groups:
- **First group:** 6 soldiers
- **Second group:** 6 soldiers

Now, calculate the total earnings from each group:
- **First group:** \( 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$5/\text{soldier} = \$30 \)
- **Second group:** \( 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$7/\text{soldier} = \$42 \)

**Total earnings:** 
\[
\$30 + \$42 = \$72
\]

**Final Answer:** Matthew would earn **\$72**.
