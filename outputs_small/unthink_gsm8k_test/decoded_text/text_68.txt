**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   
   It's given that there are **twice as many boys as girls** at Dr. Wertz's school. 
   
   - Number of girls = 60
   - Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls = 2 × 60 = 120

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 120 + 60 = 186

3. **Determine the number of teachers:**
   
   It's also given that there are **5 students to every teacher**.
   
   - Number of teachers = Total students ÷ Students per teacher = 186 ÷ 5 = 37.2

   However, since the number of teachers must be a whole number, we need to consider if there's a rounding involved. If the division results in a decimal, it might indicate that there are 37 teachers with 1 student left over, or 38 teachers with 2 students over the limit. But typically, in such contexts, we'd expect a whole number, so it's likely that the problem assumes rounding down.

   - Therefore, the number of teachers is **37**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{37}
