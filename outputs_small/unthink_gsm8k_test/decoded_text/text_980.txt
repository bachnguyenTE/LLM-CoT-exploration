Let's determine the total number of beads Adrianne has step by step.

1. **Mother's Beads:**
   - Adrianne's mother gave her **20 metallic beads**.

2. **Sister's Beads:**
   - Adrianne's sister gave her **10 more beads** than what her mother gave.
   - Calculation: \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

3. **Friend's Beads:**
   - Adrianne's friend gave her **twice as many beads** as what her mother gave.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

4. **Total Beads:**
   - Summing up all the beads:
     \[
     20 \ (\text{mother}) + 30 \ (\text{sister}) + 40 \ (\text{friend}) = 92 \ \text{beads}
     \]

**Final Answer:** Adrianne has a total of \(\boxed{92}\) beads.
