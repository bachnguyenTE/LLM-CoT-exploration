**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - **P Pompei** can lift a mountain **1 inch** high.
   - **Saskay** can lift a mountain **12 times higher** than Pompei.
   - **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain **4 times higher** than Saskay.
   - **Naruto** can lift a mountain **10 times higher** than Kagiyami.

2. **Calculate the height each person can lift:**
   
   - **P Pompei:** 1 inch
   
   - **Saskay:** 12 times higher than Pompei.
     \[
     \text{Height of Saskay} = 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]
   
   - **Kagiyami:** 4 times higher than Saskay.
     \[
     \text{Height of Kagiyami} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]
   
   - **Naruto:** 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
     \[
     \text{Height of Naruto} = 10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Convert inches to feet:**
   
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
     \[
     \text{Height of Naruto in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40 \text{ feet}}
\]
