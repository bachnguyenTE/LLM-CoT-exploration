Q: A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?

To determine how many gallons of water remain to fill the tank, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total capacity of the tank:** 18,0000 gallons
- **First day:**
  - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank.
  - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- **Second day:**
  - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she did on the first day.
  - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she did on the first day.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.**

- **Wanda's first day:**
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18,0000 = 4,5000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
- **Ms. B's first day:**
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4,5000 = 3,4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day.**

- **Wanda's second day:**
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4,5000 = 3,0000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
- **Ms. B's second day:**
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3,4125 = 1,1375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days.**

- **Total water pumped:**
  \[
  4,5000 + 3,4125 + 3,0000 + 1,1375 = 11,0375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
**Step 4: Determine the remaining water needed to fill the tank.**

- **Remaining water:**
  \[
 18,000 - 11,0375 = 6,9625 \text{ gallons}
  \]
  
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6,9625}
\]
