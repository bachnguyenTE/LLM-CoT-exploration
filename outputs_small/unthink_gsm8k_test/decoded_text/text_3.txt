**Solution:**

James runs **3 sprints** a week, and each sprint is **60 meters** long. To find the total distance he runs in a week, multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint.

\[
\text{Total meters} = 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}
\]

**Answer:** James runs a total of **180 meters** a week.
