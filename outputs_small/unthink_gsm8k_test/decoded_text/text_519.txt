Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Rob takes **2 hours** to shingle a house.
- Royce takes **40 minutes more than double** the time Rob takes.

**Step 1: Convert Rob's time to minutes.**
- Rob takes **2 hours**.
- Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate double the time Rob takes.**
- Double of 120 minutes = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

**Step 3: Add 40 minutes to double the time.**
- Royce's time = \(240 + 40 = 284\) minutes.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{284}
\]
