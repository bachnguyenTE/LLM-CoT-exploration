Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has in the end.

1. **Initial Lollipops:**
   - Oscar starts with **24 lollipops**.

2. **Eating on the Way to School:**
   - He eats **2 lollipops**.
   - **Remaining lollipops:** \(24 - 2 = 22\).

3. **Passing Lollipops to Friends:**
   - He gives **14 lollipops** to his friends.
   - **Remaining lollipops:** \(22 - 14 = 8\).

4. **Buying More Lollipops on the Way Home:**
   - He buys **twice as many lollipops** as he gave to his friends.
   - He gave **14 lollipops** to friends, so he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops.
   - **Total lollipops after buying:** \(8 + 28 = 36\).

5. **Eating More Lollipops That Night:**
   - He eats **3 more lollipops**.
   - **Remaining lollipops:** \(36 - 3 = 33\).

6. **Eating Lollipops in the Morning:**
   - He eats **2 more lollipops**.
   - **Final remaining lollipops:** \(33 - 2 = 31\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
