Let's determine the total number of acres Farmer Brown and Farmer Smith have together.

1. **Farmer Brown's Farm:**
   - Given: 200 acres.

2. **Farmer Smith's Farm:**
   - The problem states that Farmer Smith's farm is **100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm**.
   - Let's denote Farmer Brown's farm as \( B \) and Farmer Smith's farm as \( S \).
   - According to the problem:
     \[
     S = 2B + 100
     \]
   - Substituting the known value of \( B \):
     \[
     S = 2 \times 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 510 \text{ acres}
     \]

3. **Total Acres Together:**
   - Add the acres of both farms:
     \[
     B + S = 200 + 510 = 711 \text{ acres}
     \]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{711}
