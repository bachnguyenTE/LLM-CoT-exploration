**Solution:**

Anthony starts with 50 pencils.

1. **Gives 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:**
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils} = 50 - 25 = 25
   \]

2. **Gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:**
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils} = 25 - 15 = 10
   \]

3. **Anthony keeps the remaining pencils:**
   \[
   \text{Pencils Anthony keeps} = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
