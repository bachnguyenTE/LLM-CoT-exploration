To determine how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we'll calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies (1 cent each):**
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01 = \$10.00
   \]

2. **Nickels (5 cents each):**
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times \$0.05 = \$2.000
   \]

3. **Dimes (10 cents each):**
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10 = \$2.000
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills:**
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times \$1.00 = \$40.00
   \]

**Total Amount:**
\[
\$10.00 + \$2.00 + \$2.00 + \$40.00 = \$56.00
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$56.00}
\]
