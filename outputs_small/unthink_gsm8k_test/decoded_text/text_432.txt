Q: Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain.

1. **Prince Thaddeus:**
   - He slew **100 dragons** with his mighty sword.

2. **Prince Arthur:**
   - He used a spear and slew **three quarters** as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - **Three quarters of 100 dragons** is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons}
     \]

3. **Prince Walter:**
   - He used a rusty iron axe and slew **twice** as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - **Twice 75 dragons** is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons}
     \]

4. **Prince Bruce:**
   - He used a nail file and slew **one-fifth** as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - **One-fifth of 150 dragons** is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30.6 \text{ dragons}
     \]
   - However, since you can't have a fraction of a dragon, we'll consider this as **31 dragons** (rounding up).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
