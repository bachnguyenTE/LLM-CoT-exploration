Q: There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. **Shortest tree:** 6 feet.
2. **Second tree:** 5 feet taller than the shortest tree.
3. **Tallest tree:** Twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

**Step 1: Calculate the height of the second tree.**

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree:
\[
\text{Height of second tree} = 6\ \text{feet} + 5\ \text{feet} = 11\ \text{feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.**

\[
\text{Combined height} = 6\ \text{feet} + 11\ \text{feet} = 17\ \text{feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the height of the tallest tree.**

The tallest tree is twice the combined height:
\[
\text{Height of tallest tree} = 2 \times 17\ \text{feet} = 34\ \text{feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{34\ \text{feet}}
\]
