**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of the rentals, we'll calculate the cost for each person separately and then add them together.

1. **Carlos's Canoe:**
   - **Cost per hour:** \$30
   - **Hours used:** 3
   - **Total cost:** \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars

2. **Benji's Banana Boat Raft:**
   - **Cost per hour:** \$18
   - **Hours used:** 5
   - **Total cost:** \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) dollars

3. **Total Cost:**
   - **Carlos's cost:** \$90
   - **Benji's cost:** \$90
   - **Total:** \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) dollars

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{180}\)
