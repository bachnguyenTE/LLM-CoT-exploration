**Solution:**

Let's break down Peter's weekly spending step by step.

1. **Total Money Peter Has:**
   \[
   \$70
   \]

2. **Number of Days in a Week:**
   \[
   7 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Number of Days Peter Spent Money on Wooden Action Figures:**
   - **Sunday through Wednesday:** That's 4 days.

4. **Amount Spent Each Wooden Action Figure:**
   \[
   \$5 \text{ each}
   \]

5. **Total Amount Spent on Wooden Action Figures:**
   \[
   4 \text{ days} \times \$5/\text{figure} = \$20
   \]

6. **Remaining Amount for Plastic Action Figures:**
   \[
   \$70 - \$20 = \$50
   \]

7. **Number of Plastic Action Figures He Can Buy:**
   \[
   \frac{\$50}{\$2/\text{figure}} = 25 \text{ figures}
   \]

8. **Total Number of Action Figures:**
   \[
   4 \text{ wooden} + 25 \text{ plastic} = 29 \text{ figures}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
