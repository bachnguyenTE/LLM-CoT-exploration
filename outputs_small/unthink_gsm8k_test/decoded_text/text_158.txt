**Solution:**

To determine how much Raphael spent on school supplies, we'll calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Number of pens: 4
   - Cost per pen: \$1.50
   - Total cost for pens: \( 4 \times \$1.50 = \$6.00 \)

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Number of notebooks: 2
   - Cost per notebook: \$4.00
   - Total cost for notebooks: \( 2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00 \)

3. **Cost of Rim of Bond Paper:**
   - Number of items: 1
   - Cost per item: \$20.0
   - Total cost for bond paper: \( 1 \times \$20.00 = \$20.00 \)

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Sum of all costs: \( \$6.00 + \$8.00 + \$20.00 = \$34.00 \)

**Final Answer:**
Raphael spent a total of \(\boxed{\$34.00}\) on everything.
