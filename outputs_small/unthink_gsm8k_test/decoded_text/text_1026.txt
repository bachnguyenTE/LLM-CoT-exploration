Q: One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month.

### **Given:**
1. **Dwarf with bare hands:** Mines **12 pounds of ore per day**.
2. **Dwarf with iron pickaxe:** Mines **twice as much** as the dwarf with bare hands.
3. **Dwarf with steel pickaxe:** Mines **50% more** than the iron pickaxe miner.

### **Step 1: Calculate the ore mined by a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.**

- **Iron pickaxe:** Mines twice as much as the dwarf with bare hands.
  
  \[
  \text{Iron pickaxe} = 2 \times 12\ \text{pounds} = 24\ \text{pounds per day}
  \]

### **Step 2: Calculate the ore mined by a dwarf with a steel pickaxe.**

- **Steel pickaxe:** Mines **50% more** than the iron pickaxe miner.
  
  \[
  \text{Steel pickaxe} = 24\ \text{pounds} + 55\% \times 24\ \text{pounds}
  \]
  
  \[
  55\% \times 24 = 0.55 \times 24 = 13.2\ \text{pounds}
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Steel pickaxe} = 24 + 13.2 = 37.2\ \text{pounds per day}
  \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month.**

- **Number of dwarves:** 40
- **Days in a month:** 30

\[
\text{Total ore} = 40 \times 30 \times 37.2\ \text{pounds}
\]
  
  \[
  40 \times 30 = 1200
  \]
  
  \[
  1200 \times 37.2 = 8,\!640\ \text{pounds}
  \]

### **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{8,\!640\ \text{ pounds}}
\]
