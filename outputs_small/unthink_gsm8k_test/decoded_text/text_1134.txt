**Solution:**

Jane saves **\$4** every week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save to reach a total of **\$60**, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount she needs to save beyond her current savings:**
   
   \[
   \$60 - \$4 = \$56
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of weeks required to save the remaining amount:**
   
   \[
   \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per week}} = 13.5 \text{ weeks}
   \]

3. **Since partial weeks aren't possible, round up to the next whole number:**
   
   \[
   13.5 \text{ weeks} \approx 14 \text{ weeks}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
