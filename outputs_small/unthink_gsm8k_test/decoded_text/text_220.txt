It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle. Over the weekend, she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles. To find out how much time she spent playing these games, we can calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Crossword Puzzles:**
   - Time per crossword puzzle: 10 minutes
   - Number of crossword puzzles solved: 3
   - Total time for crossword puzzles: \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \)

2. **Sudoku Puzzles:**
   - Time per sudoku puzzle: 5 minutes
   - Number of sudoku puzzles solved: 8
   - Total time for sudoku puzzles: \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - Add the time spent on crossword and sudoku puzzles:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{70\ \text{minutes}}
\]
