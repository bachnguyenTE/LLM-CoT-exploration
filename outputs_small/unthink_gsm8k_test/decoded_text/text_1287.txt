Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Number of brothers:** 2
- **Number of sisters:** 3
- **Age of each sister:** 16 years (since all sisters are the same age and each is 16 years old, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that.)

**Correction:**
- **Age of each sister:** 16 years (assuming a typo in the original question, as 16 years old seems too old for a child.)

**Given:**
- **One of the brothers is 12 years old.**
- **This brother's age is half the age of the older brother.**

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the age of the older brother:**
   - If one brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, then:
     \[
     \text{Older brother's age} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total age of all brothers:**
   - There are 2 brothers.
   - One brother is 12 years old, and the other is 24 years old.
   \[
   \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total age of all sisters:**
   - There are 3 sisters, each 16 years old.
   \[
   \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Total age of brothers} + \text{Total age of sisters} = 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ years}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
