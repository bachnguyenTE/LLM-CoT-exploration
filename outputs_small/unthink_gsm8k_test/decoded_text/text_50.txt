To determine how much Lloyd makes from his egg farm per week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the weekly egg production:**
   - **Eggs per day:** 252
   - **Days in a week:** 7
   - **Total eggs per week:** \( 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs} \)

2. **Convert eggs to dozens:**
   - **Eggs per dozen:** 12
   - **Dozens of eggs per week:** \( \frac{1764 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozen} \)

3. **Calculate weekly revenue:**
   - **Price per dozen:** \$2
   - **Total revenue per week:** \( 147 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294 \)

**Final Answer:**  
Lloyd makes **\$294** per week from his egg farm.
