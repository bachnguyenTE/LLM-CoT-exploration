**Solution:**

James runs 12 miles every day for 5 days a week. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total miles run in a week:**
   \[
   12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to run 60 miles at a speed of 10 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
