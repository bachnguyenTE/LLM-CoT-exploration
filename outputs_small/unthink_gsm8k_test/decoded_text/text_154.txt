To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, let's break down his schedule:

1. **Weeks with 3-hour classes:**
   - **Mondays:** 3 hours
   - **Wednesdays:** 3 hours
   - **Fridays:** 3 hours
   - **Total per week:** \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\) hours

2. **Weeks with 2-hour classes:**
   - **Tuesdays:** 2 hours
   - **Thursdays:** 2 hours
   - **Total per week:** \(2 + 2 = 4\) hours

3. **Total weeks in a semester:** 16 weeks

4. **Calculate total hours:**
   - **9 hours/week × 16 weeks = 144 hours**
   - **4 hours/week × 16 weeks = 24 hours**
   - **Total:** \(144 + 24 = 168\) hours

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{168}\)
