Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
- Joe sells 20% of his cars.
- Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.
- Robert initially has 20 cars.

**Let’s denote:**
- Let \( R \) be the number of cars Robert has.
- Let \( J \) be the number of cars Joe has.

**Step 1: Determine Robert's initial number of cars.**
Given that \( R = 20 \).

**Step 2: Determine Joe's initial number of cars.**
Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert:
\[
J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]
So, Joe initially has **40 cars**.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe sells.**
Joe sells 20% of his cars:
\[
\text{Cars sold} = 20\% \times J = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother.**
Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold:
\[
\text{Cars given to mother} = 2 \times \text{Cars sold} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with.**
Subtract the cars sold and given to his mother from his initial count:
\[
\text{Cars remaining} = J - (\text{Cars sold} + \text{Cars given to mother}) = 40 - (8 + 16) = 40 - 24 = 20 \text{ cars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
