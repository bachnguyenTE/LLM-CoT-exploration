**Solution:**

We start with **36 penguins** sunbathing in the snow.

1. **One-third of them jump into the ocean:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 2 \text{ penguins}
   \]
   So, **2 penguins** are now in the ocean.

2. **Another one-third go inside the cave:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 2 \text{ penguins}
   \]
   So, **2 penguins** are now in the cave.

3. **Total penguins that have moved:**
   \[
   2 \text{ (ocean)} + 2 \text{ (cave)} = 4 \text{ penguins}
   \]

4. **Penguins still sunbathing:**
   \[
   36 - 4 = 32 \text{ penguins}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
