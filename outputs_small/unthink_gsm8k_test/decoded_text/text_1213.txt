**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Stephen Borrowed:**
   Stephen borrowed **\$300** from his sister.

2. **Interest on the Loan:**
   Stephen promised to return the borrowed amount plus an additional **2%** interest.
   
   - **Interest Calculation:**
     \[
     \text{Interest} = 2\% \text{ of } \$300 = 0.02 \times 300 = \$6.00
     \]
   
   - **Total Amount to be Paid Back:**
     \[
     \$300 + \$6.00 = \$336.00
     \]

3. **Stephen's Monthly Payments:**
   Stephen will give **\$25** per month for **11 months**.
   
   - **Total Amount Paid in 11 Months:**
     \[
     11 \text{ months} \times \$25/\text{month} = \$275.00
     \]
   
   - **Remaining Amount to be Paid on the 12th Month:**
     \[
     \$336.00 - \$275.00 = \$61.00
     \]
     
     (Note: The extra **\$0.00** in the calculation is due to rounding in the interest calculation.)

4. **Final Payment:**
   Stephen will pay **\$61.00** on the **12th month**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$61.00}
\]
