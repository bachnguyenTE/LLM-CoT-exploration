Q: An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the starting temperature.

### **Given:**
1. **Air Conditioner (AC) Cools the room:**
   - **On Low:** Cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - **On High:** Coils the room by 3 degrees per hour.

2. **Without AC:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.

3. **Running Schedule:**
   - **AC ran on low for 3 hours.**
   - **Then, turned up to high for 4 hours.**
   - **Afterward, turned off for 2 hours.**

### **Step 1: Calculate the Temperature Change During Each Period**

1. **AC Running on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - **Temperature Change:** \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)
   - **Assuming the AC was running to cool the room, the temperature decreases by 6 degrees.**

2. **AC Running on High for 4 Hours:**
   - **Temperature Change:** \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \)
   - **Assuming the AC was running to warm the room, the temperature increases by 12 degrees.**

3. **AC Turned Off for 2 Hours:**
   - **Temperature Change:** \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \)
   - **Assuming the AC was turned off, the temperature decreases by 4 degrees.**

### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Temperature Change**

- **Total Cooling (Low):** \( -6 \text{ degrees} \)
- **Total Warmer (High):** \( +12 \text{ degrees} \)
- **Total Cooling (Off):** \( -4 \text{ degrees} \)

- **Net Temperature Change:**
  \[
  -6 + 12 + (-4) = -8 \text{ degrees}
  \]

### **Conclusion:**

The final temperature is **8 degrees lower** than the starting temperature.

\[
\boxed{-8}
\]
