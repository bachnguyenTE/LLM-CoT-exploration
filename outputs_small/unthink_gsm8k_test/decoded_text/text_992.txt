To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down his activities:

1. **Electric Bill Check:**
   - **Frequency:** Once per month.
   - **Per Year:** \(12 \text{ checks}\).

2. **Gas Bill Check:**
   - **Frequency:** Once per month.
   - **Per Year:** \(12 \text{ checks}\).

3. **Church Checks:**
   - **Frequency:** Twice per month.
   - **Per Year:** \(2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}\).

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check:**
   - **Frequency:** Quarterly (every 3 months).
   - **Per Year:** \(4 \text{ checks}\).

**Total Checks per Year:**
\[
12 \text{ (Electric)} + 12 \text{ (Gas)} + 24 \text{ (Church)} + 4 \text{ (Pest and Lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{52}
\]
