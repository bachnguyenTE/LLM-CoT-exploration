**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Letters Sent:**
   - Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.
   - He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
   - **Letters sent:** \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters Sent Each Week:**
   - Each letter is 2 pages long.
   - **Total pages sent per week:** \(3 \text{ letters} \times 2 \text{ pages/letter} = 6 \text{ pages}\).

3. **Letters Responded to:**
   - Mike responds in kind to the remaining 2 people.
   - **Letters responded to:** 2 people.

4. **Total Letters Sent Each Week:**
   - **Letters sent:** 3 pages
   - **Letters responded to:** 2 pages
   - **Total pages sent each week:** \(3 + 2 = 5 \text{ pages}\).

5. **Writing Speed:**
   - Mike writes 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - **Writing rate:** \( \frac{1 \text{ page}}{6 \text{ minutes}} \).

6. **Total Time Spent Writing:**
   - **Total pages written per week:** 5 pages
   - **Time per page:** 6 minutes
   - **Total minutes spent writing:** \(5 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
   - **Convert minutes to hours:** \( \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0.5 \text{ hours}}
\]
