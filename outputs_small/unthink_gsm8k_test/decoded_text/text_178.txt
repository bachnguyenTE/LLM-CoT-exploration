**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bo's Crabs:**
   - It is given that Bo has **40 crabs**.

2. **Monic's Crabs:**
   - Monic has **4 fewer crabs** than Bo.
   - Calculation: \( 40 - 4 = 40 \) crabs.
   - So, Monic has **40 crabs**.

3. **Rani's Crabs:**
   - Rani has **10 more crabs** than Monic.
   - Calculation: \( 40 + 10 = 50 \) crabs.
   - So, Rani has **50 crabs**.

4. **Total Crabs:**
   - Add the crabs of all three: \( 40 + 40 + 50 = 130 \) crabs.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{130}
\]
