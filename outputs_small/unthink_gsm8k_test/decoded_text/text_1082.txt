**Solution:**

James decided to walk to the store, which is **4 miles** away from his home. He walked halfway to the store, which means he walked **2 miles**. However, he forgot something at home and had to walk back the same **2 miles**.

To find the total distance James walked:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}
\]

James walks at a speed of **4 miles per hour**. To find the time it took him to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

**Answer:** It took James **1 hour** to reach the store.
