Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs the friends found.

1. **Total Eggs Hidden:**
   - The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of **100 eggs**.

2. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins:**
   - The Smith twins each found **30 eggs**.
   - Since there are two twins, they found:
     \[
     30 \text{ eggs/twin} \times 2 \text{ twins} = 60 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Eggs Found by Their Friends:**
   - The problem states that **all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends**.
   - This means that **10 eggs** were not found by the Smith twins, and the remaining eggs (excluding these 10) were found by their friends.

4. **Calculating the Friends' Findings:**
   - First, subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins from the total eggs:
     \[
     100 \text{ total eggs} - 60 \text{ eggs (Smith twins)} = 38 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - However, this 38 eggs includes the **10 eggs** that were not found by the Smith twins.
   - Therefore, the number of eggs found by their friends is:
     \[
     38 \text{ eggs} - 10 \text{ eggs} = 28 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The friends found **28 eggs**.

\[
\boxed{28}
\]
