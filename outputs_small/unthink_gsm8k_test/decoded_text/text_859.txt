**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Customers:**
   - There are **40 customers** who gave tips.

2. **Rafaela's Tips:**
   - Each customer gave a **$20 tip**.
   - **Total tips for Rafaela** = Number of customers × Tip per customer
     \[
     40 \text{ customers} × \$20/\text{customer} = \$900
     \]

3. **Julieta's Tips:**
   - Julieta received **10% less** in tips than Rafaela.
   - **Calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips:**
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$900 = 0.10 × \$900 = \$90
     \]
   - **Julieta's tips** = Rafaela's tips - 10% of tips
     \[
     \$900 - \$90 = \$810
     \]

4. **Total Tips Received by Both:**
   - **Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips**
     \[
     \$900 + \$810 = \$1711
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1711}
\]
