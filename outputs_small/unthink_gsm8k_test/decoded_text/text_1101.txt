**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Distance Run by All Three:**
   - Amber, Micah, and Ahito together ran **52 miles**.

2. **Distance Run by Amber:**
   - Amber ran **8 miles**.

3. **Distance Run by Micah:**
   - Micah ran **3.5 times** what Amber ran.
   - **Micah's distance = 3.5 × Amber's distance**
   - **Micah's distance = 3.5 × 8 miles**
   - **Micah's distance = 28 miles**

4. **Total Distance Run by Amber and Micah:**
   - **Total = Amber's distance + Micah's distance**
   - **Total = 8 miles + 28 miles**
   - **Total = 36 miles**

5. **Distance Run by Ahito:**
   - **Total distance run by all three = 52 miles**
   - **Distance run by Ahito = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)**
   - **Distance run by Ahito = 52 miles - 36 miles**
   - **Distance run by Ahito = 16 miles**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{16}
