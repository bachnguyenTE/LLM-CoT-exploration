Q: A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?

To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the option of adding 70 pesos per hour instead of paying for a full 24-hour stay, let's break down the costs step by step.

### **Option 1: Full 24-Hour Stay**
- **Base Price:** 1600 pesos
- **Total Hours:** 24
- **Cost per Hour:** \( \frac{1600}{24} \approx 66.67 \) pesos per hour

### **Option2: Adding 70 pesos per Hour After 12 Hours**
- **Initial 12 Hours:** 1000 pesos
- **Additional Hours:** From 12 pm to 10 am (next morning) = 12 hours
- **Cost for Additional Hours:** \( 12 \times 70 = 840 \) pesos
- **Total Cost:** \( 1000 + 840 = 1840 \) pesos

### **Savings Calculation**
- **Difference in Cost:** \( 1840 - 1600 = 240 \) pesos

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}
