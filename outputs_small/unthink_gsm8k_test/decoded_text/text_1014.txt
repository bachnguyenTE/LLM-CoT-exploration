Q: Jamaar loves fresh fruit and is headed to the store with $10 he earned mowing lawns. Including tax, peaches and pears are $.5 each, apples are $.75 each, kiwis are $1, and plums cost $.25 each. If he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples, how many plums can he buy?

**Solution:**

Jamaar has \$10 to spend at the store. He has already purchased the following items:

- **Peaches:** 3 peaches at \$0.50 each
- **Pears:** 4 pears at \$0.75 each
- **Kiwis:** 2 kiwis at \$1.00 each
- **Apples:** 5 apples at \$0.25 each

First, calculate the total cost of the items already purchased.

1. **Peaches:**
   \[
   3 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.50/\text{peach} = \$1.50
   \]

2. **Pears:**
   \[
   4 \text{ pears} \times \$0.750/\text{pear} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Kiwis:**
   \[
   2 \text{ kiwis} \times \$1.00/\text{kiwi} = \$2.00
   \]

4. **Apples:**
   \[
   5 \text{ apples} \times \$0.25/\text{apple} = \$1.25
   \]

**Total Cost of Purchased Items:**
\[
\$1.50 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 + \$1.25 = \$7.75
\]

**Remaining Amount for Plums:**
\[
\$10.00 - \$7.75 = \$2.25
\]

Each plum costs \$0.25, so the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining \$2.25 is:
\[
\frac{\$2.25}{\$0.25/\text{plum}} = 9 \text{ plums}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
