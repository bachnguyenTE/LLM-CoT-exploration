To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, let's break down the earnings for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- **Truck Tires:** 6 tires repaired at \$60 each.
  \[
  6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360
  \]
- **Car Tires:** 4 tires repaired at \$40 each.
  \[
  4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160
  \]
- **Total Revenue on Thursday:**
  \[
  \$360 + \$160 = \$526
  \]

**Friday:**
- **Car Tires:** 12 tires repaired at \$40 each.
  \[
  12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480
  \]
- **Truck Tires:** 0 tires repaired.
  \[
  0 \text{ tires} \times \$0 = \$0
  \]
- **Total Revenue on Friday:**
  \[
  \$480 + \$0 = \$480
  \]

**Comparing the Two Days:**
- **Thursday's Revenue:** \$526
- **Friday's Revenue:** \$480

To find how much more revenue was earned on Thursday compared to Friday:
\[
\$526 - \$480 = \$46
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{46}
\]
