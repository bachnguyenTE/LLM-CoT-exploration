Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Initial Number of Passengers:**
- **Total passengers on the bus:** 48

**First Stop:**
1. **Passengers get off:**
   - **8 passengers** get off the bus.
   
2. **Passengers get on:**
   - **5 times as many people as the number who got off** from the bus get into the bus.
   - **Number of passengers who got off:** 8
   - **Number of passengers who get on:** \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) passengers

**Passengers Remaining After First Stop:**
- **Passengers on the bus after first stop:** 
  - **Initial passengers:** 48
  - **Passengers get off:** -8
  - **Passengers get on:** +40
  - **Total passengers:** \( 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \)

**Second Stop:**
1. **Passengers get off:**
   - **21 passengers** get off the bus.
   
2. **Passengers get on:**
   - **3 times fewer passengers** get on the bus.
   - **Number of passengers who got off:** 21
   - **Number of passengers who get on:** \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers

**Passengers Remaining After Second Stop:**
- **Passengers on the bus after second stop:** 
  - **Passengers on the bus after first stop:** 88
  - **Passengers get off:** -21
  - **Passengers get on:** +7
  - **Total passengers:** \( 88 - 21 + 7 = 74 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{74}
