Q: Sally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Bank Balance:**
   - **Starting balance:** \$200

2. **Final Bank Balance:**
   - **Ending balance:** \$420

3. **Change in Bank Balance:**
   - **Ending balance - Starting balance = \$420 - \$200 = \$220**

4. **Understanding the Change:**
   - The bank account increased by \$220 during the week.
   - This increase is due to **withholding** some amount from Sally's wage.

5. **Weekly Wage:**
   - **Total wage:** \$300

6. **Calculating Withholding:**
   - The increase in the bank balance (\$220) is the amount withheld from Sally's wage.
   - **Withheld amount = \$220**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{220}
\]
