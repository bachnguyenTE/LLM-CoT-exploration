Q: Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total cases of shingles needed: 250
- Let the number of cases needed by the first house be \( x \).
- The second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house's requirement compared to the first house. So, the second house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \).
- The third house needs double the first house's requirement, which is \( 2x \).

**Setting up the equation:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]

**Simplifying the equation:**
\[
x + 0.5x + 2x = 250
\]
\[
3.5x = 250
\]

**Solving for \( x \):**
\[
x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.428571...
\]

Since the number of cases must be a whole number, let's re-examine the problem to ensure accuracy.

**Re-examining the problem:**
- The second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house's requirement compared to the first house. This might mean the second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house's requirement, not the other way around.
  
**Correct interpretation:**
- Let the first house need \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases.

**Setting up the equation again:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]
\[
3.5x = 250
\]
\[
x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.428571...
\]

**Since the number of cases must be a whole number, let's check if there's a rounding error or if the problem expects an approximate answer.**

**Rounding to the nearest whole number:**
\[
x \approx 71
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}x \approx 35.5
\]
\[
2x \approx 142
\]
\[
Total \approx 71 + 35.5 + 142 = 158.5
\]

This is still not 250. It seems there might be a mistake in interpreting the problem.

**Alternative interpretation:**
- The second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house's requirement.
- The third house needs double the second house's requirement.

**Let's try this:**

Let the first house need \( x \) cases.
- Second house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \).
- Third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \).

**Setting up the equation:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}x + x = 250
\]
\[
2.5x = 250
\]
\[
x = \frac{250}{2.5} = 100
\]

**Calculating the third house's requirement:**
\[
x = 100
\]

**Verification:**
- First house: 100
- Second house: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \)
- Third house: 100
- Total: \( 100 + 55 + 100 = 255 \)

This exceeds the total required (250). Therefore, this interpretation is incorrect.

**Revising the interpretation:**
- The second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the third house's requirement.
- The third house needs double the first house's requirement.

Let the first house need \( x \) cases.
- Second house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \times \) third house's requirement.
- Third house needs \( 2x \).

**Setting up the equation:**
\[
x + \frac{1}{2}(2x) + 2x = 250
\]
\[
x + x + 2x = 250
\]
\[
4x = 250
\]
\[
x = \frac{250}{4} = 62.5
\]

**Since the number of cases must be a whole number, let's check the total:**
- First house:
