**Solution:**

To determine the selling price of each watermelon, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost price per watermelon:**
   
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for \$80.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{\$80}{50} = \$1.60
   \]

2. **Determine the total selling price with a 25% profit:**
   
   A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = 125\% \times \$80 = 1.25 \times \$80 = \$10.00
   \]
   
   (Note: \$1.25 × \$80 = \$100.0)

3. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   
   Divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons.
   
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\$100}{50} = \$1.82
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$1.82}
\]
