**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of tomatoes sold per week:**
   
   - **Daily tomatoes sold:** 500
   - **Days in a week:** 7
   
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes per week} = 500 \times 7 = 3,500 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly cost with the old vendor:**
   
   - **Old price per tomato:** \$0.50
   - **Total weekly cost:** 
     
     \[
     3,500 \times 0.50 = 1,750 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly cost with the new vendor:**
   
   - **New price per tomato:** \$0.40
   - **Total weekly cost:** 
     
     \[
     3,500 \times 0.40 = 1,400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the weekly savings:**
   
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 1,750 - 1,400 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{350}
\]
