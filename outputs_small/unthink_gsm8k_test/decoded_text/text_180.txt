To determine the number of votes the loser received, follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Votes:**
   \[
   \text{Total Votes} = 80
   \]

2. **Votes Received by the Winner:**
   \[
   \text{Winner's Votes} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 66
   \]

3. **Votes Received by the Loser:**
   \[
   \text{Loser's Votes} = \text{Total Votes} - \text{Winner's Votes} = 88 - 66 = 22
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
