Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Slices:**
   - The plate starts with **2 slices** of cake.

2. **Mara Adds Slices:**
   - Mara adds **3 more slices** to the plate.
   - **Total slices after addition:** \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) slices.

3. **Mara Triplets the Slices:**
   - She was getting hungrier, so she **triples** the number of slices she currently has.
   - **Total slices after tripling:** \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) slices.

4. **Mara Ate Slices:**
   - She eats **2 slices**.
   - **Total slices after eating:** \( 15 - 2 = 13 \) slices.

5. **Friend Steals Slices:**
   - While distracted, **5 slices** are stolen.
   - **Total slices after theft:** \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) slices.

**Final Number of Slices Remaining on the Plate:**
\[
\boxed{8}
