Q: Twenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total number of kids:** 20
- **Groups:** Divided into two equal groups of **girls** and **boys**
- **Boys went on a scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each.**
- **Girls brought shells:** The number of shells brought by the boys plus **four times as many seashells as the boys**

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( G \) = number of shells brought by each girl
- Let \( B \) = number of shells brought by each boy

**From the problem:**
- **Boys:** Each boy brought 60 shells.
  \[
  B = 60
  \]
- **Girls:** Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
  \[
  G = B + 4 \times B
  \]
  
**Simplify the equation for \( G \):**
\[
G = B + 4B = 5B
\]
  
**Substitute \( B = 60 \) into the equation:**
\[
G = 5 \times 60 = 300
\]
  
**Therefore, each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells.**
