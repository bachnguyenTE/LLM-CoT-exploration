**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. ** Craig's Spelling:**
   - **Number of Words Spelled:** 20
   - **Letters per Word:** 15
   - **Total Letters Spelled by Craig:** 
     \[
     20 \text{ words} \times 5 \text{ letters/word} = 100 \text{ letters}
     \]

2. **Brother's Spelling:**
   - **Total Letters Spelled by Brother:** 50 more than Craig.
   - **Total Letters Spelled by Brother:**
     \[
     100 \text{ letters} + 50 \text{ letters} = 150 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Total Letters Spelled by Both:**
   \[
   100 \text{ (Craig)} + 150 \text{ (Brother)} = 255 \text{ letters}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{255}
\]
