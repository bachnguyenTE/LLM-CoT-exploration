**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Donations:**
   - Walter collects **\$500** from his neighbors.
   - He collects **\$1500** from a fund he set up online.

2. **Lawyer's Contribution:**
   - Walter's lawyer will donate **three times** as much as everyone else donates.

3. **Additional Donations:**
   - Walter also receives **\$200** from his friend.

**Calculations:**

1. **Total Donations from Walter:**
   \[
   \$500 + \$1500 = \$2000
   \]

2. **Total Donations from Everyone Else (excluding the lawyer):**
   \[
   \$200
   \]

3. **Lawyer's Contribution:**
   - The lawyer donates three times as much as everyone else.
   \[
   3 \times \$200 = \$6000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$6000}
\]
