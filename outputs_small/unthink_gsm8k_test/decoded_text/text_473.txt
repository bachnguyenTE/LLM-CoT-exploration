To determine what percentage of the shark's body length is occupied by the combined length of its remoras, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Total length of the shark:** 10 feet
   - **Length of each remoras:** 6 inches

2. **Convert Units to Be Consistent:**
   - Since the total length is in feet and the remoras length is in inches, convert inches to feet.
   - **1 foot = 12 inches**
   - **6 inches = 6/12 = 0 feet**

3. **Calculate the Combined Length of the Remoras:**
   - **Total remoras length = 2 × 6 inches = 12 inches**
   - Convert to feet: **12 inches = 1 foot**

4. **Determine the Percentage:**
   - **Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Total length of shark) × 100**
   - **Percentage = (1 foot / 10 feet) × 100**
   - **Percentage = 0.1 × 100 = 10%**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{10\%}
