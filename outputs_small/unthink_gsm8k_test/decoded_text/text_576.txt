Q: Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?

To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom, we'll break down the costs into three main components: carpet replacement, padding, and contractor fees. Here's a step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the Area of the Bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 18\, \text{ft} \times 12\,0\text{ft} = 216\,00\, \text{sq ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the Cost of the New Carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of New Carpet} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per Square Foot} = 216\, \text{sq ft} \times \$12/\text{sq ft} = \$2,616
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost of Padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of Padding} = \text{Area} \times \text{Padding Cost per Square Foot} = 216\,00\, \text{sq ft} \times \$2/\text{sq ft} = \$432
   \]

4. **Determine the Contractor Fees:**
   - **Removal Fee:**
     \[
     \text{Removal Fee} = \text{Area} \times \$4/\text{sq ft} = 216\, \text{sq ft} \times \$4/\text{sq ft} = \$864
     \]
   - **Installation Fee:**
     \[
     \text{Installation Fee} = \text{Area} \times \$34/\text{sq ft} = 216\, \text{sq ft} \times \$34/\text{sq ft} = \$7,344
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of New Carpet} + \text{Cost of Padding} + \text{Removal Fee} + \text{Installation Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$2,616 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7,344 = \$11,256
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$11,\!256}
\]
