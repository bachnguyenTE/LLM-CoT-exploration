**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Chenny's Age:**
   - Chenny is 10 years old.

2. **Alyana's Age:**
   - Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny.
   - So, Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
   - Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years = **6 years**

3. **Anne's Age:**
   - Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.
   - So, Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
   - Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years = **8 years**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{8}
