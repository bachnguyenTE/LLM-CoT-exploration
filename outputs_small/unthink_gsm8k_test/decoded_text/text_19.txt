Q: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Marissa has already hiked:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total distance remaining:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time Marissa has spent hiking so far:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Find the total distance she needs to cover in the remaining time to achieve an average speed of 4 mph:**
   
   \[
   \text{Desired total distance} = \text{Desired average speed} \times \text{Desired total time} = 4 \text{ mph} \times t
   \]
   
   However, since we're focusing on the remaining distance, we can directly calculate the required speed for the remaining 6 miles.

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining 6 miles:**
   
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Time available}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{t}
   \]
   
   To achieve an average speed of 4 mph over the entire 12 miles, the total time should be:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Desired average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   Since she has already spent 2 hours, she has 1 hour left to cover the remaining 6 miles.
   
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ mph}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{6 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]
