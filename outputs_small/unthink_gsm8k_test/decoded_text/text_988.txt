**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings:**
   
   Jessica sets aside 25% of her \$2,000.0 monthly paycheck.
   
   \[
   25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2,000.00 = \$500.0
   \]
   
2. **Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year:**
   
   - **Cost per pair of shoes:** \$1,000.0
   - **Total savings in a year:** 
     
     \[
     \$500.00 \times 12 \text{ months} = \$6,600.00
     \]
     
   - **Number of pairs she can buy:**
     
     \[
     \frac{\$6,600.00}{\$1,000.00 \text{ per pair}} = 6.6 \text{ pairs}
     \]
     
   - Since she can't buy a fraction of a pair, she can buy **6 pairs** of shoes in a year.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
