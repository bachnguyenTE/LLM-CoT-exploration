To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Requirement:**
   - Jane needs a total of at least **42 points** across all three tests.

2. **Calculate the Total Points from the First Two Tests:**
   - **First Test:** 15 points
   - **Second Test:** 18 points
   - **Total so far:** \(15 + 18 = 33\) points

3. **Determine the Required Points for the Third Test:**
   - **Total needed:** 42 points
   - **Points already earned:** 33 points
   - **Points needed on third test:** \(42 - 33 = 9\) points

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Jane must score at least **9 points** on her third test to pass.
