**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Houses:**
   - John has **2 houses**.

2. **Bedrooms per House:**
   - Each house has **3 bedrooms**.
   - Total bedrooms = \(2 \text{ houses} \times 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} = 6 \text{ bedrooms}\).

3. **Windows per Bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom has **2 windows**.
   - Total windows in bedrooms = \(6 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

4. **Additional Windows per House:**
   - Each house has **4 additional windows** not connected to bedrooms.
   - Total additional windows = \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

5. **Total Windows in Both Houses:**
   - Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
   - Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
