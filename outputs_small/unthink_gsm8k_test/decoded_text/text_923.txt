Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

1. **Total Cups Available:**
   - Lana has **27 cups** of tea.

2. **Dividing into Rows:**
   - She divides these into **3 rows**.
   - **Equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups** in each row.

3. **Remaining Cups for Cinnamon Tea:**
   - After dividing into rows, **15 cups** are used for **cinnamon tea**.

4. **Calculating Cups in Each Row:**
   - **Total cups used for chamomile and mint tea:** 
     \[
     27 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - **Equal distribution between chamomile and mint tea:**
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2} = 6 \text{ cups of each}
     \]
   - **Cups in each row:**
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 2 \text{ cups per row}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - There are **2 cups of mint tea** in each row.

\[
