To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of books in the library:**  
   \( 50 \) books.

2. **Number of books written in English:**  
   \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the total books.  
   \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) books.

3. **Number of books written in German:**  
   \( 10\% \) of the total books.  
   \( 10\% \) of \( 55 \) is calculated as:  
   \( 0.10 \times 55 = 5.5 \) books.

   Since the number of books must be a whole number, we'll consider \( 5.5 \) as approximately \( 6 \) books for simplicity.

4. **Number of Spanish books:**  
   The remaining books after accounting for English and German books.  
   \( 55 - 25 - 6 = 7 \) books.

**Final Answer:**  
There are \(\boxed{7}\) Spanish books in the library.
