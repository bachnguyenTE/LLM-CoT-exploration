**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the weight of each candy type:**
   - **Candied Apples:** Each candied apple weighs 40 grams.
   - **Chocolate Bars:** Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
     \[
     \text{Weight of each chocolate bar} = 2 \times 40\,g = 80\,g
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of all candies:**
   - **Candied Apples:**
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 80\,000\,g \times 80\,g = 6,400,000\,g
     \]
   - **Chocolate Bars:**
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 25 \times 80\,g = 400\,g
     \]
   - **Total Weight of the Bag:**
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 6,400,000\,g + 400\,g = 6,400,400\,g
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6,\!400,\!400\,g}
\]
