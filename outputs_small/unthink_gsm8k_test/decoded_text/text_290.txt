Q: Ali is a superstar counter. He has won 22 medals for counting super fast. His friend Izzy is also a really good counter and has 5 less medals than Ali. Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many medals have been given out for counting.

1. **Ali's Medals:**
   - Ali has won **22 medals**.

2. **Izzy's Medals:**
   - Izzy has **5 less medals** than Ali.
   - **Izzy's Medals = Ali's Medals - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 medals**.

3. **Total Medals Together:**
   - **Total Medals = Ali's Medals + Izzy's Medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals**.

4. **Understanding "10 times less":**
   - The phrase "together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out" is a bit ambiguous. It could mean:
     - **Total Medals = (1/10) × Total Medals Given Out**
     - Or, **Total Medals Given Out = Total Medals Together × 10**

5. **Calculating Total Medals Given Out:**
   - If "10 times less" means **Total Medals Given Out = Total Medals Together × 10**:
     - **Total Medals Given Out = 39 × 10 = 390 medals**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{390}
\]
