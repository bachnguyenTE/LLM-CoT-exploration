**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the Pen:**
   - Theo bought a pen for **\$2**.

2. **Cost of the Paper:**
   - The paper costs **\$1 less than three times the price of the pen**.
   - First, calculate three times the price of the pen: \( 3 \times \$2 = \$6 \).
   - Then, subtract \$1 from this amount: \( \$6 - \$1 = \$5 \).
   - So, the paper costs **\$5**.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Theo gave the cashier **\$10**.
   - The total cost of the pen and paper is \( \$2 + \$5 = \$7 \).

4. **Amount of Change Received:**
   - Subtract the total cost from the amount given: \( \$10 - \$7 = \$3 \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
