**Solution:**

Jenny has a pizza with **12** slices.

1. **Giving Slices to Bill:**
   - Jenny gives **1/3** of the pizza to Bill.
   - Number of slices given to Bill: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) \) slices.

2. **Giving Slices to Mark:**
   - Jenny gives **1/4** of the pizza to Mark.
   - Number of slices given to Mark: \( \frac{1}{4} \times12 = 3) \) slices.

3. **Total Slices Given Away:**
   - Total slices given to Bill and Mark: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) slices.

4. **Slices Remaining Before Jenny Eats:**
   - Total slices initially: \( 12 \) slices.
   - Slices given away: \( 7 \) slices.
   - Slices remaining: \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) slices.

5. **Slices Eaten by Jenny:**
   - Jenny eats **2** slices.
   - Slices remaining after Jenny eats: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) slices.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
