**Solution:**

Let's determine the total cost of both the red car and the blue car step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - The price of the **blue car** is **\$100**.
   - The **red car** is **40% cheaper** than the blue car.

2. **Calculate the discount on the red car:**
   
   The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

   \[
   \text{Red Car Price} = 60\% \times \text{Blue Car Price} = 0.60 \times \$100 = \$60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cars:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Blue Car Price} + \text{Red Car Price} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$160}
\]
