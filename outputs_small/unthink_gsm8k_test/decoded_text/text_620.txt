To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total capacity of one DVD:**
   - Each DVD can be played **1000 times** before it breaks.

2. **Determine how many times each DVD has already been played:**
   - **First DVD:** 356 times
   - **Second DVD:** 135 times

3. **Calculate the remaining playtime for each DVD:**
   - **Remaining for First DVD:** \(1000 - 356 = 644\) times
   - **Remaining for Second DVD:** \(1000 - 135 = 865\) times

4. **Add the remaining playtime for both DVDs to find the total number of times they can be played together:**
   - **Total Remaining Playtime:** \(644 + 865 = 1509\) times

**Final Answer:**  
Both DVDs can be played a total of \(\boxed{1509}\) times before they break.
