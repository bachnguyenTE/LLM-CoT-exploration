Q: Tim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - He wants to make an extra gallon for Allen, making it 5 gallons in total.

2. **Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - **1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.**
   - **5 gallons of lemonade require:**
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

3. **Convert cups of lemon juice to lemons:**
   - **6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.**
   - **5 cups of lemon juice require:**
     \[
     5 \text{ cups} \div 6 \text{ cups per lemon} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ lemons}
     \]
   - **Since you can't use a fraction of a lemon, Tim will need 1 lemon.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
