Q: On a busy Saturday morning, a hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.  24 guests elected an early checkout and 15 elected for a late checkout.  In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  7 more people checked in after dinner was served.  How many guests does the hotel now have?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many guests are currently in the hotel.

1. **Total Guests on the Morning:**
   - **Total:** 100 guests
   - **Elected Early Checkout:** 24 guests
   - **Elected Late Checkout:** 15 guests
   - **Guests Still in the Hotel:** \( 100 - 24 - 15 = 61 \) guests

2. **Afternoon Check-ins:**
   - **Late Checkout Check-ins:** 15 guests
   - **Afternoon Check-ins:** Twice as many as those who checked in late. 
     - \( 2 \times 15 = 10 \) guests
   - **Additional Check-ins After Dinner:** 7 guests

3. **Total Guests After the Afternoon:**
   - **Current Guests:** 61
   - **Afternoon Check-ins:** 10 + 7 = 17 guests
   - **Total Guests Now:** \( 61 + 17 = 78 \) guests

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{78}\)
