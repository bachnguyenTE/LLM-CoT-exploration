**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of occupied beds:**
   
   - Total capacity of the hospital: 1,000 beds
   - Occupancy rate: \( \frac{1}{5} \) (or 20%)
   
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = 1,000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 200 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of unoccupied beds:**
   
   \[
   \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1,000 - 200 = 780 \text{ beds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of new admissions over 2 weeks:**
   
   - Daily admissions: 50 beds
   - Number of days: 2 weeks = 14 days
   
   \[
   \text{Total admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ beds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total occupied beds} = 220 + 700 = 922 \text{ beds}
   \]

5. **Find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total unoccupied beds} = 1,000 - 922 = 78 \text{ beds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{78}
\]
