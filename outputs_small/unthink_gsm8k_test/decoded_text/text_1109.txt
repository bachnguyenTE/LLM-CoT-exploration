To determine the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of women and their respective heel heights:**
   - **Women wearing 4-inch heels:** 3 women
   - **Women wearing 2-inch heels:** 3 women

2. **Calculate the total number of women:**
   \[
   3 \text{ women (4-inch)} + 3 \text{ women (2-inch)} = 6 \text{ women}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total height of all heels:**
   \[
   (3 \times 4 \text{ inches}) + (3 \times 2 \text{ inches}) = 12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the average height of the heels:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total height of heels}}{\text{Total number of women}} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3 \text{ inches}}
\]
