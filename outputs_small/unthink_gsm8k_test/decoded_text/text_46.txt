Q: Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased.

1. **Initial Post-it Notes:**
   - Candice started with **80** Post-it notes.

2. **Stopping at the Store:**
   - She purchased a package of Post-it notes. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in this package as \( x \).

3. **Purchasing at Work:**
   - At work, she placed **1** Post-it note on each of **220** different cups of coffee.
   - Therefore, she used **220** Post-it notes at work.

4. **Total Post-it Notes Used:**
   - Total Post-it notes used = Notes from the store + Notes used at work
   - Total used = \( x + 220 \)

5. **Post-it Notes Remaining:**
   - Candice had **23** Post-it notes remaining overall.

6. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Initial Post-it notes - Total used = Remaining Post-it notes
   - \( 80 - (x + 220) = 23 \)

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - \( 80 - x - 220 = 23 \)
   - \( -x - 140 = 23 \)
   - \( -x = 23 + 140 \)
   - \( -x = 163 \)
   - \( x = -163 \)

Wait, this doesn't make sense because the number of Post-it notes can't be negative. Let's check our setup again.

**Re-evaluating the Problem:**

- **Initial Post-it Notes:** 80
- **Post-it Notes Purchased:** \( x \)
- **Post-it Notes Used at Work:** 220
- **Post-it Notes Remaining:** 23

The correct equation should be:

\[
80 + x - 220 = 23
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 23 + 220 -80
\]
\[
x = 23 + 140
\]
\[
x = 163
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{163}
\]
