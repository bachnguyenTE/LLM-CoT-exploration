**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Ali has:**
   
   - **Four $10 bills:**  
     \( 4 \times \$10 = \$40 \)
   
   - **Six $20 bills:**  
     \( 6 \times \$20 = \$120 \)
   
   - **Total money:**  
     \( \$40 + \$120 = \$164 \)

2. **Ali gives half of the total money to his sister:**
   
   - **Half of \$164:**  
     \( \frac{1}{2} \times \$164 = \$82 \)
   
   - **Remaining money after giving to sister:**  
     \( \$164 - \$82 = \$82 \)

3. **Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:**
   
   - **Amount used for dinner:**  
     \( \frac{3}{5} \times \$82 = \$49.20 \)

4. **Calculate the remaining money after buying dinner:**
   
   - **Remaining money:**  
     \( \$82 - \$49.20 = \$32.80 \)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\$32.80}
