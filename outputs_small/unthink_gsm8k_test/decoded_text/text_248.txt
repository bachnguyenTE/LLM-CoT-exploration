**Solution:**

To determine how much the chef spent on buying the onions, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Find the total weight of the onions:**
   
   The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   The cost per pound of onions is \$1.50.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$300}
\]
