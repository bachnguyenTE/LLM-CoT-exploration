Q: 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?

To determine the height of the human pyramid, we'll calculate the total height contributed by each level and then convert the total inches to feet.

1. **Bottom Level (4 girls):**
   - Each girl is 64 inches tall.
   - Total height = \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.

2. **Second Level (3 girls):**
   - Each girl is 60 inches tall.
   - Total height = \(3 \times60 = 180\) inches.

3. **Top Level (1 girl):**
   - The shortest girl is 60 inches tall.
   - Total height = \(1 \times66 = 66\) inches.

4. **Total Height of the Pyramid:**
   - Sum of all levels: \(256 + 180 +66 = 508\) inches.

5. **Convert Inches to Feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Total height in feet = \(\frac{508}{12} = 46.333...\) feet.

\(\boxed{46.33\text{ feet}}\)
