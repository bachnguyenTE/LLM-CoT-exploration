Violetta wants to buy new crayons and has prepared \$20 for this purchase. Each crayon costs \$2. To find out how much change she will get, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of crayons Violetta can buy:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per crayon}} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ crayons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 crayons:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ crayons} \times \$2/\text{crayon} = \$20
   \]

3. **Find the change Violetta will receive:**
   
   Since Violetta spent all her money on the crayons, she will receive no change.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
