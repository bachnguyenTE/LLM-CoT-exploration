**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Chase and Rider** ride their bikes.
   - **They ride thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - **On two other days**, they ride **twice the times** they do on usual days.
   - **We need to find out how many times they ride their bikes in a week.**

2. **Calculating Usual Rides:**
   - They ride thrice a day for **5 days**.
   - **Usual rides per day:** 3 times
   - **Usual rides in 5 days:** \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) times

3. **Calculating Rides on Two Other Days:**
   - On **two other days**, they ride **twice the usual times**.
   - **Rides per usual day:** 3 times
   - **Rides on two days:** \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) times

4. **Total Weekly Rides:**
   - **Usual rides in 5 days:** 15 times
   - **Rides on two days:** 6 times
   - **Total rides in a week:** \( 15 + 6 = 21 \) times

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
