**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of people:**
   - Howie is buying cupcakes for himself.
   - His **teacher**.
   - **25 classmates**.

   **Total people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.**

2. **Determine the number of cupcakes per person:**
   - Howie wants **2 cupcakes** for himself.
   - He wants **2 cupcakes** for his teacher.
   - He wants **2 cupcakes** for each of his **25 classmates**.

   **Total cupcakes per person = 2 + 2 + (25 × 2) = 2 + 2 + 50 = 56 cupcakes per person.**

3. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:**
   - **Total cupcakes = Number of people × Cupcakes per person**
   - **Total cupcakes = 27 × 56 = 1,512 cupcakes.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1512}
