**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Candy:**
   - Both Ginger and Amy start with **100 pieces of Halloween candy**.

2. **Candy Eaten Over Time:**
   - **Ginger's Consumption:**
     - **Eats 4 pieces a day.**
     - **Over 2 weeks (14 days):**
       \[
       4 \,000 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56,000 \text{ pieces}
       \]
   - **Amy's Consumption:**
     - **Eats 3 pieces a day.**
     - **Over 2 weeks (14 days):**
       \[
       3 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 14 \,000 \text{ pieces}
       \]

3. **Candy Remaining:**
   - **Ginger's Remaining Candy:**
     \[
     100,000 - 56,000 = 44,000 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - **Amy's Remaining Candy:**
     \[
     100,000 - (3 \times 14) = 100,000 - 42 = 58,000 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Difference in Candy:**
   - **Amy's Candy - Ginger's Candy:**
     \[
     58,000 - 44,000 = 14,000 \text{ pieces}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14,000}
\]
