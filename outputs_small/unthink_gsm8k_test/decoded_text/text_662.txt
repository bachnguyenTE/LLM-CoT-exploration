**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Gus spent on the **apple pie**.

1. **Total Amount Spent by Gus:**  
   Gus spent a total of **\$20.00** at the grocery store.

2. **Breakdown of Purchases:**
   - **Bag of Chips:** \$2.000 each  
     Gus bought **2 bags of chips**, so the cost is:  
     \[
     2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00
     \]
   - **Bucket of Fried Chicken:** \$8.00  
     Gus bought **1 bucket of fried chicken**, so the cost is:  
     \[
     \$8.00
     \]
   - **Bottle of Soda:** \$1.00  
     Gus bought **1 bottle of soda**, so the cost is:  
     \[
     \$1.00
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Spent on the First Three Items:**  
   Add the costs of the chips, fried chicken, and soda:  
   \[
   \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.10
   \]

4. **Determine the Cost of the Apple Pie:**  
   Subtract the total spent on the first three items from the overall total spent:  
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.10 = \$6.90
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The apple pie cost **\$6.90**.

\[
\boxed{\$6.90}
