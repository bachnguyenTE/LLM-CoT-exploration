Q: Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?

Let's determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

**Given:**
- **Marie's total payment:** \$50
- **Cost of each pizza:** \$8.50
- **Number of chicken meals:** 1, costing \$12 each
- **Number of milk packs:** 5, costing \$3 each
- **Number of apples:** 4, costing \$1.50 each

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of other items.**

1. **Chicken meal:**
   \[
   1 \times \$12 = \$12
   \]
   
2. **Milk packs:**
   \[
   5 \times \$3 = \$15
   \]
   
3. **Apples:**
   \[
   4 \times \$1.50 = \$6.00
   \]
   
**Step 2: Sum the costs of these items.**
\[
\$12 + \$5 + \$6.00 = \$23.00
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost of other items from the total payment to find the cost of pizza.**
\[
\$50 - \$23.00 = \$27.00
\]

**Step 4: Determine the number of pizza boxes.**
\[
\frac{\$27.00}{\$8.50 \text{ per box}} = 3.2
\]

Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a pizza box, we'll consider the whole number of boxes she could have ordered.

**Final Answer:**
Marie ordered **3 boxes of pizza**.
