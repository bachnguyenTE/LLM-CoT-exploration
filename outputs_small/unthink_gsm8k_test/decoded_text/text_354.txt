**Solution:**

1. **Total Cost of the Phone:**
   \[
   \$400
   \]

2. **Amount Annabelle Already Has:**
   \[
   \$80
   \]

3. **Amount Saved from the First Job:**
   \[
   20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200
   \]

4. **Amount Saved from the Second Job:**
   \[
   15 \text{ hours} \times \$5/\text{hour} = \$75
   \]

5. **Total Amount Saved:**
   \[
   \$80 + \$200 + \$75 = \$358
   \]

6. **Amount Still Needed to Save:**
   \[
   \$400 - \$358 = \$42
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$42}
