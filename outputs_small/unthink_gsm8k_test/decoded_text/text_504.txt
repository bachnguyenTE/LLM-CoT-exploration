Q: Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much each pack of **strawberry gum** cost.

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Suzie bought **4 packs** of gum in total.
   - She liked **strawberry gum** and bought **2 packs** of it.
   - She bought **1 pack** of **grape gum** for \$2.
   - She paid **half as much** for a **green apple gum** pack compared to the grape gum.

2. **Determine the cost of the green apple gum:**
   - The grape gum costs \$2.
   - The green apple gum costs half of that: 
     \[
     \text{Cost of green apple gum} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$2 = \$1
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the known items:**
   - **Strawberry gum:** 2 packs at an unknown price per pack (let's call it \( x \)).
   - **Grape gum:** 1 pack at \$2.
   - **Green apple gum:** 1 pack at \$1.
   - **Total cost:** \$7.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   2x + 2 + 1 = 7
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 3 = 7 \\
   2x = 7 - 3 \\
   2x = 4 \\
   x = \frac{4}{2} \\
   x = 2
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Each pack of **strawberry gum** cost **\$2**.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
