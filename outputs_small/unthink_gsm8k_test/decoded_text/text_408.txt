To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pages in the Book:**
   \[
   45 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. **Words per Page:**
   \[
   200 \text{ words/page}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words}
   \]

3. **Reading Speed:**
   \[
   300 \text{ words per minute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time to Read the Book} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total Time Needed:**
   \[
   \text{Time to Get to Airport} + \text{Time to Read the Book} = 10 + 30 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time Available:**
   \[
   60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Early by:**
   \[
   60 - 40 = 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
