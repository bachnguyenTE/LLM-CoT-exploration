**Solution:**

John runs a total of **60 miles** in one week. He runs **3 days** a week. 

- **First day:** He runs **3 hours**.
- **Second and third days:** He runs half as much as the first day.

Let's break down the total miles and find out how fast he runs.

1. **Total Miles:**
   \[
   \text{Total Miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **First Day:**
   \[
   \text{First Day Miles} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Second and Third Days:**
   \[
   \text{Each of the other two days} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Miles Run:**
   \[
   \text{Total Miles} = \text{First Day} + 2 \times \text{Other Days} = 3 + 2 \times 1.5 = 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Miles per Hour:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Miles}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]
