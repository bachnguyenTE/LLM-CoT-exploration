**Solution:**

To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the distance around the Earth, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - **Alfie's daily flight distance:** 400 kilometers.
   - **Circumference of the Earth:** 40,000 kilometers.

2. **Calculate half the circumference of the Earth:**
   \[
   \text{Half of Earth's circumference} = \frac{40,\!000}{2} = 20,\!000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days required to fly 20,000 kilometers at 400 kilometers per day:**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,\!000}{400} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
