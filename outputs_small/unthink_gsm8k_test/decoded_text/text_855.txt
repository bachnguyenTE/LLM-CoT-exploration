Q: I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old you are.

**Let's define the variables:**
- Let \( I \) be your age.
- Let \( B \) be your brother's age.
- Let \( S \) be your sister's age.
- Let \( M \) be your mom's age.

**Given information:**
1. You are three years younger than your brother:
   \[
   I = B - 3
   \]
2. You are two years older than your sister:
   \[
   I = S + 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S = I - 2
   \]
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
   \[
   M = 3B - 1
   \]
4. The sum of all your ages is 87:
   \[
   I + B + S + M = 87
   \]

**Step 1: Substitute the expressions for \( I \) and \( S \) into the total age equation.**

From equation 1:
\[
I = B - 3
\]
From equation 2:
\[
S = I - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5
\]

Now, substitute \( I \) and \( S \) into the total age equation:
\[
(B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + M = 87
\]
Simplify:
\[
B - 3 + B + B - 5 + M = 87
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
3B - 8 + M = 87
\]
Solve for \( M \):
\[
M = 87 - 3B + 8 = 95 - 3B
\]

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for \( M \) into the equation for \( M \).**

From earlier:
\[
M = 3B - 1
\]
Set equal to the expression from the total age:
\[
3B - 1 = 95 - 3B
\]
Solve for \( B \):
\[
3B + 3B = 95 + 1
\]
\[
6B = 96
\]
\[
B = 16
\]

**Step 3: Find your age \( I \).**

From equation 1:
\[
I = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
