**Solution:**

To determine how many windows Hannah smashed, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of students' cars with windows:**
   - There are **64 students' cars**.
   - Each car has **4 windows**.
   - **Total windows on students' cars:** \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

2. **Calculate the number of teachers' cars with windows:**
   - There are **32 teachers' cars**.
   - Each car has **2 windows**.
   - **Total windows on teachers' cars:** \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

3. **Determine the total number of windows Hannah smashed:**
   - Hannah smashes **1/4** of the students' car windows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows}
     \]
   - She smashes **3/4** of the teachers' car windows:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows}
     \]
   - **Total smashed windows:** \( 64 + 48 = 112 \) windows.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{112}
\]
