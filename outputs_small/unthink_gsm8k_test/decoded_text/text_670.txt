**Solution:**

To determine how much candy each person would have after pooling and sharing equally, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of candy:**
   \[
   \text{Total candy} = 3\ \text{pounds} + 5\ \text{pounds} + 4\ \text{pounds} = 12\ \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of people sharing the candy:**
   \[
   \text{Number of people} = 3 \text{ (Robert, Cindy, Aaron)}
   \]

3. **Divide the total candy equally among the three:**
   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = \frac{12\ \text{pounds}}{3} = 4\ \text{pounds}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4\ \text{pounds}}
\]
