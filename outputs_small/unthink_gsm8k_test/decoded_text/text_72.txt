**Solution:**

Tommy is raising money by selling brownies and cheesecakes. Here's how to calculate the total amount he raises:

1. **Calculate the money from brownies:**
   - **Price per brownie:** \$3
   - **Number sold:** 43
   - **Total from brownies:** \( 43 \times 3 = \$129 \)

2. **Calculate the money from cheesecakes:**
   - **Price per cheesecake:** \$4
   - **Number sold:** 23
   - **Total from cheesecakes:** \( 23 \times 4 = \$92 \)

3. **Calculate the total money raised:**
   - **Total from brownies:** \$129
   - **Total from cheesecakes:** \$92
   - **Total money raised:** \( 129 + 92 = \$221 \)
