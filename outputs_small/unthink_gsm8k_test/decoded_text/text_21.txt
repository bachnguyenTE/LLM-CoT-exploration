**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Samantha's Age:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Calculate the Time Since Samantha was Born:**
   - Since Samantha is 31 now, she was born 31 years ago.

3. **Determine Raymond's Age:**
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, if Samantha is 31, Raymond is \(31 + 6 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine When Raymond's Son Was Born:**
   - Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23.
   - Since Raymond is now 37, the son was born \(37 - 23 = 14\) years ago.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Raymond's son was born **14 years ago.**

\boxed{14}
