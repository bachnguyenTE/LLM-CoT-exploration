Q: The local firefighters are doing a “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.  For how many hours do they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, assuming an equal amount raised in every hour?

**Solution:**

We need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to raise \$6,300, given that they have already raised \$2,100 in the first 3 hours and plan to raise an equal amount each hour.

1. **Calculate the remaining amount to be raised:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \$6,300 - \$2,100 = \$4,200
   \]

2. **Determine the amount raised per hour:**
   
   \[
   \text{Amount per Hour} = \frac{\$2,100}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$700 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional hours needed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Additional Hours} = \frac{\$4,200}{\$700 \text{ per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Find the total number of hours required:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 3 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
