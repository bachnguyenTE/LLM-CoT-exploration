Q: Carl’s favorite food is cheese. He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. How many slices of cheese did he use?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lunch:**
   - Carl eats a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich uses **2 slices of cheese**.
   - **Total cheese used for lunch:** \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast:**
   - Carl eats **cheese and egg omelets** for breakfast 3 days.
   - Each omelet uses **1 more slice of cheese** than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses **2 slices**, each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices} \).
   - **Total cheese used for breakfast:** \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl makes a **big dish of macaroni and cheese** for several dinners.
   - He uses **8 slices of cheese** in it.

4. **Total Cheese Used:**
   - **Lunch:** 14 slices
   - **Breakfast:** 9 slices
   - **Macaroni and Cheese:** 8 slices
   - **Total:** \( 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \text{ slices} \)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{31}
