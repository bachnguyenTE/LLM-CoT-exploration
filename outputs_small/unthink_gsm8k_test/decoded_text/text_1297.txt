To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - **Passion Fruit:** 2 pounds × \$6 per pound = \$12
   - **Jackfruit:** 1.5 pounds × \$8 per pound = \$12
   - **Honey:** 2 pounds × \$10 per pound = \$20
   - **Total Cost per Jar:** \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = **\$24**

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - **Total Cost:** 10 jars × \$24 per jar = **\$240**

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - **Total Revenue:** 10 jars × \$50 per jar = **\$500**

4. **Determine the profit:**
   - **Profit:** Total Revenue - Total Cost = \$500 - \$240 = **\$260**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{266}
