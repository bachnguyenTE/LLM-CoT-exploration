**Solution:**

To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, follow these steps:

1. **Convert all heights to the same unit:**
   - **Xavier's original height:** 4 feet.
     - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, Xavier's original height is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - **Cole's original height:** 50 inches.

2. **Add the growth to each person's original height:**
   - **Xavier's new height:** \(48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}\).
   - **Cole's new height:** \(50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}\).

3. **Calculate the difference in their heights:**
   - **Difference:** \(52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}\).

**Final Answer:**  
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch.
