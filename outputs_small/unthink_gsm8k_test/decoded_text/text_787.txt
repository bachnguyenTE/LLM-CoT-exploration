Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total TVs sold: 40
- Fraction of smart TVs: \( \frac{1}{4} \)
- Fraction of analog TVs: \( \frac{1}{8} \)
- The rest are OLED TVs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of smart TVs sold.**
\[
\text{Smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of analog TVs sold.**
\[
\text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of smart and analog TVs sold.**
\[
\text{Total Smart and Analog TVs} = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold.**
\[
\text{OLED TVs} = \text{Total TVs} - \text{Total Smart and Analog TVs} = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
