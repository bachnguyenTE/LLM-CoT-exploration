To find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we'll add the number of blue birds in each tree:

1. **First set of trees:** Each of the 3 trees has 7 blue birds.
   \[
   3 \text{ trees} \times 7 \text{ birds/tree} = 21 \text{ birds}
   \]

2. **Second set of trees:** Each of the 2 trees has 4 blue birds.
   \[
   2 \text{ trees} \times 4 \text{ birds/tree} = 8 \text{ birds}
   \]

3. **Final tree:** This tree has 3 blue birds.
   \[
   1 \text{ tree} \times 3 \text{ birds/tree} = 3 \text{ birds}
   \]

4. **Total blue birds:**
   \[
   21 \text{ birds} + 8 \text{ birds} + 3 \text{ birds} = 32 \text{ birds}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{32}\)
