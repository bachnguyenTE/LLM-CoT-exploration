A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of bugs Nancy saw.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Nancy saw **90 spiders**.

2. **Millipedes:**
   - The number of millipedes is **1/3** of the number of spiders.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \) millipedes.

3. **Stink Bugs:**
   - The number of stink bugs is **twice the number of millipedes minus 12**.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 54 \) stink bugs.

4. **Total Number of Bugs:**
   - Add the number of millipedes and stink bugs together.
   - Calculation: \( 30 + 54 = 84 \) bugs.

**Final Answer:** Nancy counted a total of \(\boxed{84}\) bugs.
