Q: Four books are arranged on a shelf. The first book is 31 mm thick while the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. What is the total thickness of the four books?

To find the total thickness of the four books, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **First Book:**  
   The first book is **31 mm** thick.

2. **Second Book:**  
   The second book is **50 mm** thick.

3. **Third Book:**  
   The third book is **5 mm** less thick than the second book.  
   \[
   \text{Thickness of third book} = 50\, \text{mm} - 5\,0\, \text{mm} = 45\, \text{mm}
   \]

4. **Fourth Book:**  
   The fourth book is **twice as thick** as the first book.  
   \[
   \text{Thickness of fourth book} = 2 \times 31\, \text{mm} = 62\, \text{mm}
   \]

5. **Total Thickness:**  
   Now, add up the thicknesses of all four books.  
   \[
   \text{Total thickness} = 31\, \text{mm} + 50\, \text{mm} + 45\, \text{mm} + 62\, \text{mm} = 190\, \text{mm}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{196\, \text{mm}}
\]
