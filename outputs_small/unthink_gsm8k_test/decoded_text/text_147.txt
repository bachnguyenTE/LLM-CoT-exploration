Q: Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours.

1. **First 6 Hours:**
   - **30 bees** leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 Hours:**
   - **1/2 that many** (i.e., \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees) return to the hive.
   - **15 bees** return.

3. **Next 6 Hours:**
   - **Two times as many** as the first 6 hours (i.e., \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees) return.
   - **66 bees** return.

4. **Next 6 Hours:**
   - **Every bee that left before that** (i.e., the 30 bees) hasn't already returned, so they return again.
   - **30 bees** return.

**Total Bees Returning in the Last 6 Hours:**
\[
15 \text{ (from second 6 hours)} + 66 \text{ (from third 6 hours)} + 30 \text{ (from fourth 6 hours)} = 111 \text{ bees}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1111}
\]
