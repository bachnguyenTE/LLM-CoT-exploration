Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many children are following the ice cream truck after it has traveled through three streets.

1. **First Street:**
   - **Children on the truck:** 5
   - **Children chasing the truck:** 5
   - **Total children following the truck:** \(5 + 5 = 10\)

2. **Second Street:**
   - **Children on the truck:** 10 (from the first street)
   - **Children joining the truck:** Each child is joined by another child.
   - **Total children joining the truck:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
   - **Total children following the truck:** \(10 + 20 = 30\)

3. **Third Street:**
   - **Children on the truck:** 30 (from the second street)
   - **Children joining the truck:** Each child is joined by another 2 children.
   - **Total children joining the truck:** \(30 \times 2 = 60\)
   - **Total children following the truck:** \(30 + 60 = 90\)

4. **Children Leaving:**
   - **Original 5 children leave.**
   - **Total children following the truck after leaving:** \(90 - 5 = 85\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{85}\)
