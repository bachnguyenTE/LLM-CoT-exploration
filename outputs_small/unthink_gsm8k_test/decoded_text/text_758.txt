**Solution:**

To determine the final price after a 5% discount on a \$140 item, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 5\% \times \$140 = 0.05 \times 140 = \$7.00
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**
   
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \$140 - \$7.00 = \$136.90
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$136.90}
\]
