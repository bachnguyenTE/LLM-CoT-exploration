**Solution:**

We start with the initial temperature of **2 degrees Celsius**.

1. **Drop of 8 degrees Celsius overnight:**
   \[
   2^\circ \text{C} - 8^\circ \text{C} = -6^\circ \text{C}
   \]
   
2. **Increase of 3 degrees Celsius in the morning:**
   \[
   -6^\circ \text{C} + 3^\circ \text{C} = -3^\circ \text{C}
   \]

**Final Temperature in the Morning:**
\[
\boxed{-3^\circ \text{C}}
\]
