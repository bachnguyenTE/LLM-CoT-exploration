Q: A store offers sandwiches in 3 different package sizes: the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the second with 4 sandwiches for $6, and a third with 8 sandwiches, but the price is not indicated. Knowing that the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?

To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we'll analyze the pricing pattern based on the given information.

1. **First Package:**
   - **Number of Sandwiches:** 2
   - **Cost:** \$3

2. **Second Package:**
   - **Number of Sandwiches:** 4
   - **Cost:** \$6

3. **Third Package:**
   - **Number of Sandwiches:** 8
   - **Cost:** ? (To be determined)

**Step 1: Identify the Pricing Pattern**

Notice that the number of sandwiches doubles from the first to the second package, and the cost also doubles (\$3 to \$6). This suggests a proportional pricing pattern.

**Step 2: Calculate the Cost for 8 Sandwiches**

Since the cost doubles every time the number of sandwiches doubles, we can apply this pattern:

- **2 sandwiches:** \$3
- **4 sandwiches:** \$6 (double of \$3)
- **8 sandwiches:** \$12 (double of \$6)

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\$12}
