**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hair Care:**
   - Iris spent \$400 on her hair.

2. **Manicure:**
   - The cost of the manicure is **1/4** of the hair cost.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 440 = 110
     \]
   - So, she spent \$111 on the manicure.

3. **Pedicure:**
   - The cost of the pedicure is **3/4** of the manicure cost.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 111 = 83.25
     \]
   - So, she spent \$83.25 on the pedicure.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Now, add up all the expenses:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 440 (\text{Hair}) + 111 (\text{Manicure}) + 83.25 (\text{Pedicure}) = 634.25
     \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{634.25}
\]
