**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   
   James buys 10 new CDs, each costing \$15.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times \$15 = \$150
   \]

2. **Apply the discount:**
   
   The CDs are on sale for 40% off.
   
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 40\% \times \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$66
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost After Discount} = \$150 - \$66 = \$150 - \$66 = \$84
   \]
   
   (Note: There was a calculation error in the original solution. The correct total after discount is \$84.)

3. **Determine the number of CDs sold:**
   
   James doesn't like 5 CDs and sells the remaining.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs Sold} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Sales Amount} = 5 \times \$40 = \$200
   \]

4. **Calculate the final amount James is out:**
   
   Subtract the total sales from the total cost after discount.
   
   \[
   \text{Final Amount Out} = \$84 - \$200 = -\$116
   \]
   
   (The negative sign indicates a loss.)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{-116}
\]
