**Solution:**

To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, follow these steps:

1. **Daily Earnings:**
   - Damien finds **10 bottle caps** each day.
   - Each bottle cap is worth **\$0.250** (assuming a typo, as currency typically uses a decimal like \$0.25 or \$0.25).

2. **Monthly Earnings:**
   - Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month.
   - **Total = 10 bottle caps/day × \$0.25/day × 30 days**

3. **Calculation:**
   - **Total = 10 × 0.25 × 30 = 75**

**Answer:**  
Damien makes **\$75.00** in a 30-day month.
