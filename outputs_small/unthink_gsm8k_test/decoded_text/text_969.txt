**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people:**
   - John
   - His 2 kids
   - His wife
   - **Total: 4 people**

2. **Determine the pricing structure:**
   - The first phone is full price.
   - The next two phones (after the first two) are half price.
   - The fourth phone is full price.

3. **Calculate the cost for each phone:**
   - **First phone:** \$600 (full price)
   - **Second phone:** \$600 / 2 = \$300 (half price)
   - **Third phone:** \$300 (half price)
   - **Fourth phone:** \$600 (full price)

4. **Sum up the costs:**
   - **Total cost:** \$600 + \$300 + \$300 + \$600 = **\$1890**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{1890}
