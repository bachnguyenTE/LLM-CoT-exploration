**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of water bottles needed for all guests:**
   
   \[
   70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy:**
   
   \[
   140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles available} = 92 \text{ additional bottles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{92}
\]
