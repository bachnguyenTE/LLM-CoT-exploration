Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend.

1. **Total Emails Sent Daily:**
   - Robyn sends **16 emails** a day.

2. **Emails to Work:**
   - She sends **7 emails** to work.

3. **Remaining Emails:**
   - After sending **7 emails** to work, the remaining emails are:
     \[
     16 \text{ emails}
     \]
     (since \(16 - 7 = 9\), wait, let me correct that.)

   - **Total emails after work:** \(16 - 7 = 9\) emails.

4. **Emails to Family:**
   - Two-thirds of the **remaining emails** are sent to family.
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
     \]
     (since \(9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6\).)

5. **Emails to boyfriend:**
   - One-third of the **other emails** (which are not to work or family) are sent to her boyfriend.
     - **Emails to boyfriend:** 
       \[
       \frac{1}{3} \times (9 - 6) = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email}
       \]
       (since \(9 - 6 = 3\), and \(3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1\).)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
