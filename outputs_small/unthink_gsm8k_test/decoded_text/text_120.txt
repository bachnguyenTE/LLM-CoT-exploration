**Solution:**

Miguel uses **2 pads of paper** every week. Each pad contains **30 sheets** of paper.

To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we can multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:

\[
2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
\]

Since there are **4 weeks** in a month:

\[
60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{240}
\]
