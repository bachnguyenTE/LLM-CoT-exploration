Q: A simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. How many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid?

To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need **2 pieces of paper**. Here's how:

1. **First Piece:**
   - **Step 1:** Fold the paper vertically and unfold it.
   - **Step 2:** Print page 1 on the left back and page 2 on the left front.
   - **Step3:** Fold the paper vertically again and unfold it.
   - **Step4:** Print page 32 on the right back and page 31 on the right front.

2. **Second Piece:**
   - **Step1:** Take the second piece of paper.
   - **Step2:** Fold it vertically and unfold it.
   - **Step3:** Print page 32 on the left back and page 31 on the left front.

By folding and unfolding the paper twice, you can create a tabloid with 32 pages.
