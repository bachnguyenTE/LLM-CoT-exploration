**Solution:**

We are given that the ratio of men to women on a bus is **5:9**. The total number of passengers on the bus is **84**. Additionally, **20 women alight from the bus** at the next stop. We need to determine how many women remain on the bus.

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   
   The ratio **5:9** represents the number of men to women on the bus. This means for every **5** men, there are **9** women.

2. **Total Parts in the Ratio:**
   
   The total number of parts in the ratio is:
   \[
   5 \text{ (men)} + 9 \text{ (women)} = 14 \text{ parts}
   \]

3. **Determining the Value of Each Part:**
   
   The total number of passengers is **84**. Each part of the ratio represents:
   \[
   \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]
   
   So, each part equals **6** passengers.

4. **Calculating the Number of Women:**
   
   Since there are **9** parts for women:
   \[
   9 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 54 \text{ women}
   \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Men:**
   
   Similarly, for men:
   \[
   5 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 30 \text{ men}
   \]

6. **Verifying the Total Passengers:**
   
   Adding men and women:
   \[
   30 \text{ men} + 54 \text{ women} = 84 \text{ passengers}
   \]
   
   This matches the given total, confirming our calculations are correct.

7. **Determining the Remaining Women:**
   
   After **20 women** alight, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
   \[
   54 \text{ women} - 20 \text{ women} = 34 \text{ women}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
