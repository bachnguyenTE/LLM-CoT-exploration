To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we'll analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Children per Row:**
   - Each group of children stands in **8 children in a row**.

2. **Number of Rows:**
   - There are **7 rows** for each school.

3. **Schools:**
   - There are **5 different schools** participating.

**Calculations:**

- **Children per School:**
  \[
  \text{Children per School} = \text{Children per Row} \times \text{Number of Rows} = 8 \times 7 = 56 \text{ children}
  \]

- **Total Children:**
  \[
  \text{Total Children} = \text{Children per School} \times \text{Number of Schools} = 56 \times 5 = 280 \text{ children}
  \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{280}
\]
