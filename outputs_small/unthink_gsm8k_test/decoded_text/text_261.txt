**Solution:**

To determine the total dollar amount in a stack containing two-thirds of the 9,300 pennies in the cup, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:**
   
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 6,200 \text{ pennies}
   \]

2. **Convert pennies to dollars:**
   
   Since 100 pennies = 1 dollar,
   
   \[
   6,200 \text{ pennies} = 6,200 \div 100 = 62.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{62.00}
\]
