Q: When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour.  On his first anniversary at work, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour.  Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was.  If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally after working 20 hours.

### **Billy's Earnings:**
1. **Initial Salary:**
   - **First Month:** \$10.00 per hour.
   - **After 2 Months:** \$0.50.00 per hour (raise of \$0.50.00).
   - **First Anniversary Raise:** \$1.0.0 per hour.

2. **Total Hours Worked:**
   - **20 Hours.**

3. **Calculating Earnings:**
   - **First Month:** 
     \[
     10.00 \,00 \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 20.0.0 \,00
     \]
   - **Next 2 Months (4 months total):**
     \[
     0.50.00 \times 20 \,00 = 10.00 \,00
     \]
   - **First Anniversary:**
     \[
     1.00.00 \times 20 \,00 = 20.00 \, \text{Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let's recalculate.}
     \]
     Actually, the raise is applied to the new hourly rate, not the total amount. So, the correct calculation is:
     \[
     1.00.00 \times 20 \,00 = 22.00.00
     \]
   - **Total Earnings:**
     \[
     20.00.00 + 10.00.00 + 22.00.00 = 52.00.00
     \]

### **Sally's Earnings:**
1. **Starting Salary:**
   - **Sally's Starting Salary:**
     \[
     \text{Billy's Starting Salary} + 0.50.00 = 10.00.00 + 0.50.00 = 10.50.00
     \]
   - **Sally's Hourly Rate:**
     \[
     10.50.00 + 0.50.00 = 11.00.00 \, \text{per hour}
     \]
2. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   11.00.00 \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 220.00.00
   \]

### **Difference in Earnings:**
\[
\text{Billy's Earnings} - \text{Sally's Earnings} = 52.00.00 - 220.00.00 = -168.00.00
\]

Wait, this result doesn't make sense because Billy should earn more. Let's re-examine the calculations.

**Correcting Billy's Earnings:**

1. **First Month:**
   \[
   10.00.00 \times 20 = 200.00.00
   \]
2. **Next 2 Months (4 months total):**
   \[
   0.50.00 \times 20 = 100.00.00
   \]
3. **First Anniversary:**
   \[
   1.00.00 \times 20 = 220.00.00
   \]
4. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   200.00.00 + 100.00.00 + 220.00.00 = 520.00.00
   \]

**Correcting Sally's Earnings:**

1. **Starting Salary:**
   \[
   10.50.00 \times 20 = 210.00.00
   \]
2. **Total Earnings:**
   \[
   11.00.00 \times 20 = 220.00.00
   \]
3. **Difference:**
   \[
   520.00.00 - 220.00.00 = 300.00.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{300.000}
\]
