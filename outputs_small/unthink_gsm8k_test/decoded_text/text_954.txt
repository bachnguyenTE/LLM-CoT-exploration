**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cups.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of measuring spoons.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Jonathan has **two dozen cups**. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cups.
     \[
     C = 24
     \]
   - Jonathan has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**. This translates to:
     \[
     M = \frac{2}{3}C
     \]
   - He gifts Pedro **6 measuring spoons**.

3. **Calculate the Number of Measuring Spoons:**
   \[
   M = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
   \]
   So, Jonathan initially has **16 measuring cups** and **16 measuring spoons**.

4. **After Gifting:**
   - Measuring cups remaining:
     \[
     16 - 6 = 10
     \]
   - Measuring spoons remaining:
     \[
     16 - 6 = 10
     \]

5. **Total Number of Utensils Remaining:**
   \[
   \text{Total Utensils} = \text{Measuring Cups} + \text{Measuring Spoons} = 10 + 10 = 20
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
