To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Time Hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from **5 PM to 9 PM**, which is **4 hours**.

2. **Free Time:**
   - He gets **1 hour** free.

3. **Paid Hours:**
   - Subtract the free time from the total time:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ paid hours}
     \]

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The first paid hour costs **\$15**.
   - Each subsequent paid hour costs **twice the cost** of the previous one.

   Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
   - **First hour:** \$15
   - **Second hour:** \$15 × 2 = \$30
   - **Third hour:** \$30 × 2 = \$60

5. **Total Payment:**
   - Add up the costs of all paid hours:
     \[
     \$15 + \$30 + \$60 = \$105
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{105}
\]
