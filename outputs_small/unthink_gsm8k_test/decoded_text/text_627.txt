To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled **10 cars** each day.
   - **Total for first three days:** \( 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \)

2. **Remaining Days:**
   - After the first three days, the tow truck pulled **4 fewer cars** each day.
   - Let's assume there are **7 days** in a week.
   - **Remaining days:** \( 7 \text{ days} - 3 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ days} \)
   - **Cars towed each day for the remaining days:** \( 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \)
   - **Total for remaining days:** \( 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \)

3. **Total Cars Towed in the Week:**
   - **Total = First three days + Remaining days**
   - \( 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{54}\)
