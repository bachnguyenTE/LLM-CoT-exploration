**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of streetlights per intersection:**
   - Each pole has **4 streetlights**.
   - There are **6 poles** at each intersection.
   - **Streetlights per intersection = 4 (streetlights per pole) × 6 (poles) = 24 streetlights.**

2. **Calculate the total number of streetlights for all intersections:**
   - There are **4 intersections**.
   - **Total streetlights = 24 (streetlights per intersection) × 4 (intersections) = 96 streetlights.**

3. **Find the number of functioning streetlights:**
   - **20 streetlights are not working.**
   - **Functioning streetlights = Total streetlights - Non-working streetlights = 96 - 20 = 74 streetlights.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{74}
