To determine the total number of chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Tuesday:**  
   They make **125 chimichangas**.

2. **Wednesday:**  
   They also make **125 chimichangas**.

3. **Friday:**  
   They make **twice as many as on Tuesday**, which means:  
   \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \) chimichangas.

4. **Total for the Three Days:**  
   Add the chimichangas made on each day:  
   \( 125 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 125 \,3 \,5 \,5 \,5 \,5 \,5 \,5 \, (\text{Wednesday}) + 250 \,3 \,5 \, (\text{Friday}) \)  
   \( = 125 + 125 + 250 = 505 \) chimichangas.

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{555}
