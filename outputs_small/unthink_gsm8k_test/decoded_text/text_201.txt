**Solution:**

John won an award with a **1-time monetary reward of \$5,000** and a **5% salary increase**. His weekly salary is **\$2,000**. He receives this salary every week of the year and the award was received on the **first day of the year**.

**Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from the weekly salary.**

There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 52 \text{ weeks} \times \$2,000/\text{week} = \$106,400
\]

**Step 2: Add the monetary reward.**

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$106,400 + \$5,000 = \$111,500
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$11,\!500}
\]
