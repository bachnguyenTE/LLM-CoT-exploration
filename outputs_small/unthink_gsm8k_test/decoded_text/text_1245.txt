Q: Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( S \) = number of strawberry ice cubes
- \( B \) = number of blueberry ice cubes

**Given:**
1. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.
   \[
   B = 5S - 4
   \]
2. The total number of ice cubes is 116.
   \[
   S + B = 116
   \]

**Substitute the expression for \( B \) into the total equation:**
\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

**Combine like terms:**
\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]

**Add 4 to both sides:**
\[
6S = 120
\]

**Divide both sides by 6:**
\[
S = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

**Now, find \( B \):**
\[
B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 106
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{106}
\]
