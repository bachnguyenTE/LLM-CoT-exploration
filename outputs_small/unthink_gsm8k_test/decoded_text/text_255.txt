**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - There are **10 stalls** (assuming a typo, as the original problem mentions "ten stalls," but we'll proceed with 100 stalls for clarity).
   - Each stall has **20 cows**.
   - Total cows initially: \(10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}\).

2. **Mr. Sylas's Purchase:**
   - He buys **40 cows** (assuming a typo, as the original problem mentions "40 cows," but we'll proceed with 40 cows for clarity).
   - He divides these **40 cows** equally among the **10 stalls**.
   - Cows per stall after purchase: \( \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{10 \text{ stalls}} = 4 \text{ cows/stall} \).

3. **Total Cows in 8 Stalls:**
   - After adding the new cows, each stall has \(20 + 4 = 26\) cows.
   - For **8 stalls**, the total number of cows is: \(8 \text{ stalls} \times 26 \text{ cows/stall} = 144 \text{ cows}\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{144}
\]
