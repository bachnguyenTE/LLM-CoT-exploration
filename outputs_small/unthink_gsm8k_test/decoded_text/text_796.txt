**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of employees after each month:**
   
   - **Month 1:**
     - Initial employees: 200
     - New hires: 20
     - Total employees: 200 + 20 = 220
   
   - **Month 2:**
     - Employees from previous month: 220
     - New hires: 20
     - Total employees: 220 + 20 = 242
   
   - **Month 3:**
     - Employees from previous month: 242
     - New hires: 20
     - Total employees: 242 + 20 = 262

2. **Calculate the total monthly salary:**
   
   - **Total employees after 3 months:** 262
   - **Monthly salary per employee:** \$4,000
   - **Total monthly salary:** 262 × 4,000 = \$105,320

3. **Calculate the total salary for 3 months:**
   
   - **Total salary for 3 months:** 3 × 105,320 = \$315,960

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{315960}
