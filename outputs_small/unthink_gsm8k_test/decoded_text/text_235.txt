To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Friends:** There are 20 friends.

2. **Slices per Friend:** Each friend wants 4 slices.

3. **Total Slices Needed:** 
   \[
   20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices per Pizza:** Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

5. **Number of Pizzas Needed:**
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

**Final Answer:** John needs to order \boxed{10} pizzas.
