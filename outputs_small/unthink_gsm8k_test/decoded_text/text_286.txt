**Solution:**

First, let's determine the total amount of money Kelly has.

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 5 \times 25 = 125 \) cents.

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Kelly has 2 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) cents.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has:**
   - Total money = Value of quarters + Value of dimes
   - Total money = \( 125 + 20 = 145 \) cents.

4. **Determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying the can of pop:**
   - The can of pop costs 55 cents.
   - Money left = Total money - Cost of can of pop
   - Money left = \( 145 - 55 = 90 \) cents.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{90}
