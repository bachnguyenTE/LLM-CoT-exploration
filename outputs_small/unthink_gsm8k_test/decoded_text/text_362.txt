A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds.

To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Rottweiler Bed:**
   - Takes **8 pounds** of stuffing.

2. **Chihuahua Bed:**
   - Takes **2 pounds** of stuffing.

3. **Collie Bed:**
   - Takes the **average** amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler Bed and a Chihuahua Bed.
   - **Average** = \(\frac{8 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, let's calculate the total stuffing needed for the specified beds:

- **4 Chihuahua Beds:**
  - \(4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds/bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}\)

- **3 Collie Beds:**
  - \(3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

Finally, add the stuffing needed for all beds together:

- **Total Stuffing Needed:**
  - \(8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}\)

**Answer:** Mark needs **23 pounds** of stuffing.
