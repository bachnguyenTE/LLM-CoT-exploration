Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

**Find:**
Jean's age.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Jan's age:**
   - Jan is 30 years old.

2. **Calculate Jan's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 30 years.

3. **Set up the equation based on the second statement:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Let Mark's age two years ago be \( M \).
   - According to the statement:
     \[
     M = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jan's age two years ago} + 5
     \]
   - Substitute Jan's age:
     \[
     M = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
     \]
   - So, Mark was 20 years old two years ago.

4. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Mark's current age = 20 + 2 = 22 years.

5. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Jean's current age = 22 + 2 = 24 years.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
