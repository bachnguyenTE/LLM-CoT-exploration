Q: Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

To determine how long the winner will wait at their house before the loser finishes the race, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Steve's details:**
  - Distance from school: 3 miles
  - Biking speed: 440 feet per minute
- **Tim's details:**
  - Distance from school: 2 miles
  - Skateboarding speed: 264 feet per minute

### **Step 1: Convert Miles to Feet**
Since the speeds are given in feet per minute, it's easier to work with feet.

- **Steve's distance:** 3 miles = \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet
- **Tim's distance:** 2 miles = \(2 \times 5280 = 10584\) feet

### **Step 2: Calculate Time to Reach School**
Time is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed.

- **Steve's time:**
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
  
- **Tim's time:**
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10584}{264} = 40.27 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### **Step 3: Determine the Winner and the Waiting Time**
- **Steve's time:** 36 minutes
- **Tim's time:** 40.27 minutes

Since **Steve** arrives faster, he will be the winner. The waiting time is the difference between their arrival times.

\[
\text{Waiting Time} = \text{Tim's time} - \text{Steve's time} = 40.27 - 36 = 4.27 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Final Answer**
\[
\boxed{4.27 \text{ minutes}}
\]
