Q: Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?

To determine how many dollars Shawnda made that day, let's break down the inflating service for each type of vehicle:

1. **Bicycles (5 people):**
   - Each person needs 2 tires.
   - Total tires needed: \(5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\).

2. **Tricycles (3 people):**
   - Each person needs 3 tires.
   - Total tires needed: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\).

3. **Unicycles (1 person):**
   - Each person needs 1 tire.
   - Total tires needed: \(1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\).

**Total Tires Inflated:**
\[
10 \text{ (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}
\]

Since each tire costs **25 cents**, the total earnings for the day are:
\[
20 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} = \$5.00
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$5.00}
\]
