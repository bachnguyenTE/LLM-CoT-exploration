**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of times Gary does laundry in a year:**
   
   - Gary does laundry **2 times a week**.
   - There are **52 weeks** in a year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total laundry times per year} = 2 \times 52 = 104
   \]

2. **Calculate the total water usage for laundry in a year:**
   
   - Each load of laundry uses **20 gallons** of water.
   
   \[
   \text{Total water usage} = 104 \times 20 = 2080 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the water:**
   
   - A gallon of water costs **\$0.15**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2080 \times 0.15 = 312 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{312}
\]
