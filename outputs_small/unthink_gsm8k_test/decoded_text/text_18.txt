Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of omelets Claire eats in a day:**
   - She makes 1 omelet every morning.
   - Therefore, she eats **1 egg** per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks:**
   - There are **7 days** in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) days.
   - Since she eats 1 egg each day, she eats \( 28 \times 1 = 28 \) eggs in 4 weeks.

3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - To find out how many dozens, divide the total number of eggs by 12.
   - \( \frac{28}{12} = 2 \frac{4}{12} = 2 \frac{1}{3} \) dozens.

**Final Answer:**
Claire will eat **2 and 1/3** dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

\boxed{2 \frac{1}{3}}
