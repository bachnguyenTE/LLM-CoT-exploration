**Solution:**

Ella earns money by walking dogs at a constant rate. To find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate.

1. **Calculate the hourly rate:**
   
   Ella earned **\$33** for walking dogs for **3 hours**.
   
   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine earnings for 12 hours:**
   
   If her hourly rate is **\$11**, then for **12 hours**, she would earn:
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{132}
\]
