To determine the total amount of money Carolyn's delivery service company paid to its employees in May and June, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Hours Worked by Each Employee in May**

- **Number of employees hired in May:** 40
- **Hours per week:** 40
- **Wage per hour:** \$15

\[
\text{Total hours per employee in May} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

\[
\text{Total pay per employee in May} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$200
\]

\[
\text{Total pay for all employees in May} = 40 \text{ employees} \times \$200/\text{employee} = \$8,000
\]

### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Employees Exired in June**

- **1/4 of the contracts expired in June.**

\[
\text{Number of employees expired} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
\]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Hours Worked by the Exired Employees in June**

\[
\text{Total hours per expired employee in June} = 40 \text{ hours/week}
\]

\[
\text{Total pay per expired employee in June} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600
\]

\[
\text{Total pay for expired employees in June} = 10 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{employee} = \$6,600
\]

### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Payment for Both Months**

\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \$8,000
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \$6,600
\]

\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \$8,000 + \$6,600 = \$14,600
\]

\[
\boxed{\$14,\!600}
\]
