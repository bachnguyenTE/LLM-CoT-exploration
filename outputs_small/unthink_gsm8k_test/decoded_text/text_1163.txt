**Solution:**

Tyrion uses a face mask two times every time he goes out. He goes out three times a day.

1. **Face masks per day:**
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/day} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

2. **Face masks over 2 days:**
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
