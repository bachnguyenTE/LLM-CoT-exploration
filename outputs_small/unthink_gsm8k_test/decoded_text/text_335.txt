**Solution:**

To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we'll calculate the sugar required for each type of batch separately and then add them together.

1. **Sugar for Suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires **30 ounces** of sugar.
   - For **8 batches** of suckers:
     \[
     8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces/batch} = 240 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Sugar for Fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires **70 ounces** of sugar.
   - For **1 batch** of fudge:
     \[
     1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces/batch} = 77 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Total Sugar Needed:**
   - Add the sugar required for both batches:
     \[
     240 \text{ ounces} + 77 \text{ ounces} = 317 \text{ ounces}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{317 \text{ ounces}}
\]
