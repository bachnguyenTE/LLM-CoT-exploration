Q: Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?

**Solution:**

We are given that Mark's second-story window is **20 feet** high. A beanstalk starts at **4 feet** and doubles in height every day. We need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than the window.

Let's denote:
- **Initial height of the beanstalk** (\( h_0 \)) = 4 feet
- **Height of the window** = 20 feet
- **Height of the beanstalk on day \( n \)** = \( h_n \)
- **Number of days** = \( n \)

Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[
h_n = h_0 \times 2^n
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
h_n = 4 \times 2^n
\]
We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[
h_n > 20
\]
Substituting the expression for \( h_n \):
\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
2^n > 5
\]
Now, we'll solve for \( n \) by testing integer values:

- **For \( n = 2 \):**
  \[
  2^2 = 4 \quad (\text{Not greater than } 5)
  \]
  
- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  2^3 = 8 \quad (\text{Greater than } 5)
  \]
  
Therefore, it will take **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
