Q: Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald originally.
- Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to diet.
- Lee's time with the improved diet is **38 seconds**.

**Find:**
- Gerald's new time with the improved diet.

**Let's define variables:**
- Let \( G \) be Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
- Therefore, Lee's original time is \( G - 2 \) seconds.

**After Gerald's diet improvement:**
- His new time is \( G - 2 - 10\% \) of \( G \).

**Given that Lee's time with the improved diet is 38 seconds:**
\[
(G - 2) - 0.10G = 38
\]

**Simplify the equation:**
\[
G - 2 - 0.10G = 38
\]
\[
(1 - 0.10)G - 2 = 38
\]
\[
0.90G - 2 = 38
\]

**Solve for \( G \):**
\[
0.90G = 38 + 2
\]
\[
0.90G = 40
\]
\[
G = \frac{40}{0.90}
\]
\[
G \approx 44.44 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Now, calculate Gerald's new time with the 10% improvement:**
\[
\text{New Time} = G - 0.10G = 0.90G
\]
\[
\text{New Time} = 0.90 \times 44.44 \approx 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
