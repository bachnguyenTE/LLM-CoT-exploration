**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of episodes:**
   - Each episode is **20 minutes long**.
   - The total number of episodes is **half as many as the total minutes per episode**.

   Let \( E \) represent the number of episodes.

   According to the problem:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]
   So, there are **10 episodes** in total.

2. **Calculate the total watching time:**
   - If John watches every episode, the total time spent will be:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Number of Episodes} \times \text{Duration per Episode} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{200}
\]
