**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the daily recommended cups of coffee:**
   
   - Let \( C \) represent the **daily recommended cups of coffee**.

2. **Octavia's coffee consumption:**
   
   - Octavia drinks **half the daily recommended cups**.
   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{C}{2} \) cups per day.

3. **Juan's coffee consumption:**
   
   - Juan drinks **10 times the amount** of coffee that Octavia drinks.
   - So, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{C}{2} = 5C \) cups per day.

4. **Current situation:**
   
   - Juan is currently drinking \( 5C \) cups per day, but his doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to the **daily recommendation of 4 cups**.

5. **Calculate the reduction needed:**
   
   - **Reduction required** = **Current consumption** - **Desired consumption**
   - Reduction = \( 5C - 4 \) cups per day.

6. **Final Answer:**
   
   - Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by **\( 5C - 4 \) cups**.

**Answer:**  
\boxed{5C - 4}
