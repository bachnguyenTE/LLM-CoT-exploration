To determine how many students are good at math, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of students in the class:** 20

2. **Students good at math only:** 5

3. **Students good at English only:** 8

4. **Students good at both math and English:** Let's denote this number as \( x \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of students:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Math only} + \text{English only} + \text{Both}
\]

\[
20 = 5 + 8 + x
\]

\[
20 = 13 + x
\]

\[
x = 20 - 13
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of students good at both math and English is **9**.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math (including those who are good at both):

\[
\text{Total math students} = \text{Math only} + \text{Both}
\]

\[
\text{Total math students} = 5 + 9
\]

\[
\text{Total math students} = 14
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{14}\)
