To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total work time:**
   - **Writing:** 4 hours
   - **Recording:** Half of the writing time, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - **Editing:** 90 minutes

   **Convert all times to the same unit (hours):**
   - **Recording:** 2 hours
   - **Editing:** \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

   **Total work time:**
   \[
   4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage spent editing:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Editing Time}}{\text{Total Work Time}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100\% = 0.2 \times 100\% = 20\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]
