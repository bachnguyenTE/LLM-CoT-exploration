Q: Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total distance the horse runs:**
   
   - **Speed of the horse:** 32 miles per hour (MPH)
   - **Time the horse runs:** 30 minutes
   
   First, convert the time from minutes to hours:
   
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   Now, calculate the distance:
   
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay needed:**
   
   - **Hay consumption:** 1/2 bail per mile
   - **Total hay needed:** 
     
     \[
     \text{Hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
     \]
   
   - **Cost of hay:** Each bail costs \$3.
     
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3/\text{bail} = \$24
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of money Michael has:**
   
   - **Number of \$5 bills:** 6
   
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30
   \]

4. **Calculate the change Michael receives:**
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$6}
\]
