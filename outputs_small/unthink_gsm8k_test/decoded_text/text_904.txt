To determine the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Tickets Purchased:**
   
   - There are **9** Fast and Furious movies.
   - Deepa has seen each movie **3 times**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Tickets} = 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times} = 27 \text{ tickets}
   \]

2. **Total Amount Spent:**
   
   - Deepa spent a total of **\$216**.

3. **Average Price per Ticket:**
   
   To find the average price per ticket, divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.

   \[
   \text{Average Price per Ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} = \$8 \text{ per ticket}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$8}
\]
