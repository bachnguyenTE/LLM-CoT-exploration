Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Chris's Trees:**
   - Chris has 6 trees in his yard.

2. **Ferdinand's Trees:**
   - Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
   - Ferdinand has **3 trees**.

3. **Harry's Trees:**
   - Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
   - Calculation:
     - Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
     - Add 5: \( 6 + 5 = 11 \)
   - Harry has **11 trees**.

4. **Difference Between Harry's and Ferdinand's Trees:**
   - Calculation: \( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{8}
