Q: On a certain day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per balloon on the original day:**
   
   - Total cost for 20 balloons: \$900
   - Number of balloons: 20
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45
   \]

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   
   - Price increase: \$20
   
   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 170 \times \$65 = \$10,050
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$10,050}
\]
