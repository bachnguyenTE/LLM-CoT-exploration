**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation:**
   
   - **Sunscreen usage per hour:** 1 ounce
   - **Hours outside per day:** 4 hours
   - **Days of vacation:** 8 days

   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen usage} = 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \,000 \, \text{hours} = 40,00 \, \text{ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles needed:**
   
   - **Bottle size:** 8 ounces
   - **Total sunscreen needed:** 40,00 ounces

   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{40,00 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 5 \, \text{bottles}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{5}\) bottles of sunscreen.
