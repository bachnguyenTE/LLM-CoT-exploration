**Solution:**

To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in the new shoes, follow these steps:

1. **Total Walking Time:**  
   It takes **240 minutes** of walking to break in the shoes.

2. **Number of Days in Three Weeks:**  
   There are **3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days**.

3. **Walking Days Per Week:**  
   Jason can walk **4 days** a week.

4. **Total Walking Days in Three Weeks:**  
   \( 4 \text{ days/week} × 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \).

5. **Walking Time Per Day:**  
   \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \).

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{20}
