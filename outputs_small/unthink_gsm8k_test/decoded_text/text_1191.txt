**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we'll break down the costs step by step.

1. **Color Cost:**
   - The color costs a flat rate of \$400.

2. **Haircut Cost:**
   - The cost depends on the length of the hair. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - **Change in length:** \( 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \)
   - The cost per inch is \$30.
   - **Total haircut cost:** \( 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - **Color cost + Haircut cost:** \( \$400 + \$60 = \$464 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$464}
\]
