Q: Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Dana's running speed is **4 times faster** than her walking speed.
- Her skipping speed is **half** of her running speed.
- **Skipping speed** is **3 miles per hour**.
- She spends **one-third of the time** running and **two-thirds of the time** walking.
- **Total time** is **6 hours**.

**Step 1: Determine Dana's Walking Speed**

Let \( v_w \) be Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.

- **Running speed** = \( 4 \times v_w \).
- **Skipping speed** = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4v_w = 2v_w \).

Given that **skipping speed** is **3 mph**:
\[
2v_w = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_w = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Running and Walking Speeds**

- **Walking speed** = \( 1.5 \) mph.
- **Running speed** = \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) mph.

**Step 3: Determine the Time Spent Running and Walking**

Total time = 6 hours.

- **Time running** = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
- **Time walking** = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

**Step 4: Calculate Distances Covered**

- **Distance running** = \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.
- **Distance walking** = \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) miles.

**Step 4: Calculate Total Distance**

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
\[
12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
