**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Liam's Earnings:**
   - Liam claims he made \$63 one weekend.

2. **Mitchell's Earnings:**
   - Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at \$4 each.
   - To find his total earnings, multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade:
     \[
     21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4/\text{lemonade} = \$84
     \]

3. **Comparing Earnings:**
   - To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam:
     \[
     \$84 - \$63 = \$21
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
