</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total tons of grapes produced per year:**
   
   - Josie has a 10-acre farm.
   - Each acre produces **5 tons** of grapes per year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total tons of grapes} = 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons}
   \]

2. **Convert tons of grapes to barrels of wine:**
   
   - Each ton of grapes makes **2 barrels** of wine.
   
   \[
   \text{Total barrels of wine} = 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 110 \text{ barrels}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
