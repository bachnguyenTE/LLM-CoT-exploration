**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.
   - Her mom picked **20 apples**.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked:**
   - Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate her apples as:
     \[
     \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mom's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ apples}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both:**
   - Add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = \text{Mom's apples} + \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
