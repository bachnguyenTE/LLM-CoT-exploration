To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Monday:**  
   32 classes visited.

2. **Tuesday:**  
   Twice as many classes visited as on Monday.  
   Calculation: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) classes.

3. **Wednesday:**  
   Three times as many classes visited as on Monday.  
   Calculation: \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \) classes.

4. **Thursday:**  
   Another 30 classes visited.  
   Calculation: 30 classes.

5. **Friday:**  
   25 classes visited.

Now, let's add up all the classes that visited from Monday to Friday:

\[
32 \, 64, 96, 30, 25
\]

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 162
\]

\[
162 + 30 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 25 = 217
\]

**Total classes that visited the Science Center last week:** \(\boxed{217}\)
