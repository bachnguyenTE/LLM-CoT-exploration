Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Number of blue blocks = 4
- Number of yellow blocks = 2 × (number of blue blocks) = 2 × 4 = 8
- Let the number of red blocks = \( R \)
- Total number of blocks = 32

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
\[
\text{Total blue and yellow blocks} = 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} = 12
\]

**Step 2:** Subtract the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks.
\[
R = 32 \text{ (total)} - 12 \text{ (blue and yellow)} = 20
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
