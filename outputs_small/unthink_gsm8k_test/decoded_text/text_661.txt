Q: Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the cost per pound of the more expensive brand of coffee:**
   
   - Original price per pound: \$5
   - Increase: 20%
   
   \[
   \text{Increased price} = 5 + (5 \times 0.20) = 5 + 1 = \$6 \text{ per pound}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total coffee needed for a week:**
   
   - Usage per day: 1 pound
   - Days in a week: 7
   
   \[
   \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \times 7 = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Compute the total cost for the coffee:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total coffee cost} = 7 \times 6 = \$42
   \]

4. **Add the cost of the donut:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
