Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Initial Counts:**
- **Male Guppies:** 4
- **Female Guppies:** 7
- **Male Goldfishes:** 3
- **Female Goldfishes:** 5

**After Tate Buys:**
- **Male Guppies:** 4 + 2 = **6**
- **Female Guppies:** 7 + 1 = **8**
- **Male Goldfishes:** 3 + 2 = **5**
- **Female Goldfishes:** 5 + 3 = **8**

**Total Female Fishes:** 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = **16**

**Total Male Fishes:** 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = **11**

**Difference:** 16 (female) - 11 (male) = **5**

**Final Answer:** \boxed{5}
