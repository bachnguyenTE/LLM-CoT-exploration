**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of jello cups needed:**
   
   - **Number of kids:** 30 (Assuming a typo, it should be 30, but let's proceed with 30 for now.)
   - **Jello cups per kid:** 4
   
   \[
   \text{Total jello cups} = 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups/kid} = 120 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Find out how many jello cups are in the box:**
   
   - **Jello in the box:** 3 ounces
   
3. **Calculate how many boxes Greg needs:**
   
   - **Jello cups per box:** 10
   
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups/box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
   \]

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   
   - **Price per box:** \$1.25
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25/\text{box} = \$15.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$15.00}
\]
