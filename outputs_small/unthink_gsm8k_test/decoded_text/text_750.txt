To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we'll calculate the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate chairs rented during weekdays in one month.**
- **Weekday chairs per day:** 60 chairs
- **Weekdays in a month:** 5 days
- **Total weekday chairs in one month:** \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) chairs

**Step 2: Calculate chairs rented during weekends in one month.**
- **Weekend chairs per day:** 100 chairs
- **Weekends in a month:** 2 days
- **Total weekend chairs in one month:** \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) chairs

**Step 3: Calculate chairs rented in one 4-week month.**
- **Total chairs in one month:** \( 375 + 200 = 575 \) chairs

**Step 4: Calculate chairs rented in two 4-week months.**
- **Total chairs in two months:** \( 575 \times 2 = 1150 \) chairs

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1150}
\]
