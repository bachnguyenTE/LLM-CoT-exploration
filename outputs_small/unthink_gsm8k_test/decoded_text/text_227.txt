Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Chad still needs to pay after using his gift card.

1. **Base Burrito:**  
   The base burrito costs **\$6.50**.

2. **Additional Items:**
   - **Extra Meat:** \$2.00  
   - **Extra Cheese:** \$1.00  
   - **Avocado:** \$1.0  
   - **2 sauces:** Each sauce is \$0.25, so 2 sauces cost \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).

   **Total Additional Items Cost:**  
   \[
   \$2.000 + \$1.00 + \$1.00 + \$0.50 = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Upgraded Meal:**  
   Chad decides to upgrade his meal for an extra **\$3.00**, which includes **chips** and **a drink**.

4. **Gift Card:**  
   Chad has a gift card worth **\$5.00** that he uses at check out.

5. **Calculating Total Cost:**
   - **Base Burrito:** \$6.50  
   - **Additional Items:** \$5.00  
   - **Upgraded Meal:** \$3.00  
   - **Gift Card:** \$5.00  

   **Total Cost:**  
   \[
   \$6.50 + \$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$5.00 = \$19.00
   \]

6. **Amount Paid Using Gift Card:**  
   Chad uses his gift card worth **\$5.00**, so the amount he effectively pays is **\$5.00**.

7. **Amount Still Owning:**  
   \[
   \$19.00 - \$5.00 = \$14.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{\$14.00}
\]
