A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total money John has after selling the lego sets:**
   
   - **Number of lego sets sold:** 13
   - **Selling price per lego set:** \$15
   
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = \$65
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   
   - **Number of video games bought:** 8
   - **Cost per video game:** \$20
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for video games} = 8 \times 20 = \$160
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount of money John had initially:**
   
   - **Money left after buying video games:** \$5
   - **Total money spent on video games:** \$165 (from lego sets) + \$160 (on video games) = \$225
   
   \[
   \text{Total initial money} = \text{Money spent on video games} + \text{Money left}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total initial money} = 225 + 5 = \$230
   \]

4. **Find out how many lego sets John still has:**
   
   - **Total lego sets initially:** 13
   - **Lego sets sold:** 13
   
   Since John sold all his lego sets, he has **0 lego sets** left.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
