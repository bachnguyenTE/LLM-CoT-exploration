**Solution:**

Mark currently has \$50 in his bank account. He earns \$10 per day from his job. He wants to buy a bike that costs \$300.

1. **Calculate the total amount Mark needs to save:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Savings Needed} = \text{Cost of Bike} - \text{Current Amount}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total Savings Needed} = \$300 - \$50 = \$245
   \]

2. **Determine how many days Mark needs to work to save the required amount:**
   
   Mark saves \$10 per day.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Days} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Needed}}{\text{Daily Savings}}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Days} = \frac{\$245}{\$1/\text{day}} = 245 \text{ days}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Mark needs to save for **245 days** to afford the bike.
