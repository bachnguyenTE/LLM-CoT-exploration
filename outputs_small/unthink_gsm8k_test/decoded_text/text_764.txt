To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck, let's break down each person's purchases and calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Leila's Purchase:**
   - **Cucumbers:** 3 cucumbers at \$2 each.
   - **Cost Calculation:** \( 3 \text{ cucumbers} \times \$2/\text{cucumber} = \$6 \).

2. **Jack's Purchase:**
   - **Tomatoes:** 5 tomatoes at \$1 each.
   - **Cost Calculation:** \( 5 \text{ tomatoes} \times \$1/\text{tomato} = \$5 \).

3. **Chase's Purchase:**
   - **Lettuce:** 1 head of lettuce at \$3 each.
   - **Cost Calculation:** \( 1 \text{ lettuce} \times \$3/\text{lettuce} = \$3 \).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Summing Up:** \( \$6 + \$5 + \$3 = \$14 \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{14}\)
