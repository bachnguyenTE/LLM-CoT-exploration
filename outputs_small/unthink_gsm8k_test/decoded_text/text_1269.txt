**Solution:**

Let's break down Elvis's journey step by step.

1. **First Part of the Journey:**
   - **Distance:** Elvis drives west for 5 hours.
   - **Speed:** 18 mph.
   - **Distance Covered:**  
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \,000 \times 5 = 90 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Direction:** West.

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - **Distance:** Elvis turns around and drives east for 8 hours.
   - **Speed:** 18 mph.
   - **Distance Covered:**  
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 18 \,000 \times 8 = 144 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Direction:** East.

3. **Final Position Relative to the Starting Point:**
   - Elvis has driven 90 miles west and then 144 miles east.
   - Since he's going back east, we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance:
     \[
     144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - **Direction:** East.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{54 \text{ miles east}}
\]
