To determine the total cost of each uniform, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hat:**
   - The hat costs **\$25**.

2. **Cost of the Jacket:**
   - The jacket costs **three times as much as the hat**.
   - **Cost of Jacket** = 3 × **Cost of Hat** = 3 × \$25 = **\$150**.

3. **Cost of the Pants:**
   - The pants cost **the average of the costs of the hat and jacket**.
   - **Average Cost** = (Cost of Hat + Cost of Jacket) / 2 = (\$25 + \$150) / 2 = \$175 / 2 = **\$87.50**.

4. **Total Cost of the Uniform:**
   - **Total Cost** = **Cost of Hat** + **Cost of Jacket** + **Cost of Pants** = \$25 + \$150 + \$87.50 = **\$262.50**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$262.50}
\]
