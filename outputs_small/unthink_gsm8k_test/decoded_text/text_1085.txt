**Solution:**

To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years at the given rate, follow these steps:

1. **Find the annual growth rate:**
   
   The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Growth Rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the growth over 13 years:**
   
   Multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years.
   
   \[
   \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{26}
\]
