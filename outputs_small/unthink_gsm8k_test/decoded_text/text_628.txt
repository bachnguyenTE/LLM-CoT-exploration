To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the requirements:**
   - **Minimum height to ride:** 4 feet
   - **Current height of Adam:** 40 inches
   - **Growth rate:** 2 inches per year

2. **Convert the required height to inches:**
   - 4 feet = 48 inches

3. **Calculate the difference in height:**
   - 48 inches (required) - 40 inches (Adam's current height) = 8 inches

4. **Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches at a rate of 2 inches per year:**
   - \( \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{4}
