**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total milk production per day:**
   - The farmer has 3 cows.
   - Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day.
   - Total milk production = Number of cows × Milk per cow per day
   - Total milk production = 3 cows × 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

2. **Determine the additional milk needed:**
   - The farmer needs a total of 25 liters of milk per day.
   - Additional milk needed = Total required milk - Current production
   - Additional milk needed = 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

3. **Determine the number of additional cows needed:**
   - Each additional cow produces 5 liters of milk per day.
   - Number of additional cows = Additional milk needed / Milk per cow per day
   - Number of additional cows = 10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

**Final Answer:**
The farmer needs to add \(\boxed{2}\) more cows to produce 25 liters of milk daily.
