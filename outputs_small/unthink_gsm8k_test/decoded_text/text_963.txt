Q: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( A \) = number of Pokemon Alex has caught
- \( S \) = number of Pokemon Stan has caught
- \( D \) = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught

**Given:**
1. Together, they have caught a total of 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

**Step 1:** Express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( D \).

From equation (2):
\[
A = S + 5
\]

From equation (3):
\[
S = 4D - 13
\]

Substitute \( S \) into equation (2):
\[
A = (4D - 13) + 5 = 4D - 8
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

\[
A + S + D = 339
\]
\[
(4D - 8) + (4D - 13) + D = 339
\]

**Step 3:** Combine like terms.

\[
4D - 8 + 4D - 13 + D = 339
\]
\[
(4D + 4D + D) + (-8 -13) = 339
\]
\[
9D - 21 = 339
\]

**Step 4:** Solve for \( D \).

\[
9D = 339 + 21
\]
\[
9D = 360
\]
\[
D = \frac{360}{9} = 40
\]

**Step 5:** Find \( S \) using \( D = 40 \).

\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 157
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{157}
\]
