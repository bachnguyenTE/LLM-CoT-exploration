**Solution:**

To determine how much change the electronics seller will receive, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone} = 5 \times \$7000 = \$35,000
   \]

2. **Subtract the amount given by the buyer from the total cost to find the change:**
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Amount Given} = \$35,000 - \$4,000 = \$31,000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$31,\!000}
\]
