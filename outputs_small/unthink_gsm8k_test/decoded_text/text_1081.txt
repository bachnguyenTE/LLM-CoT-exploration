Let's break down the problem step by step to find Frankie's score.

**Given:**
- Binkie's score = 90
- Frankie's score = 15 more than twice Binkie's score

**Step 1:** Calculate twice Binkie's score.
\[
2 \times 90 = 180
\]

**Step 2:** Add 15 to the result to find Frankie's score.
\[
180 + 15 = 195
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{195}
\]
