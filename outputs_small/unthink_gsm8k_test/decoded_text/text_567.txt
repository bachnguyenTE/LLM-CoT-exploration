Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - Sharon received **\$5.00** for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Tooth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received **\$1.00** per tooth.
   - **Total for three teeth:** \( 3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00 \)

3. **Last Two Tooth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount received for the first tooth.
   - **Amount per tooth:** \( \frac{\$5.00}{2} = \$2.50 \)
   - **Total for two teeth:** \( 2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00 \)

4. **Total Money Left by the Tooth Fairy:**
   - **First Tooth:** \$5.00
   - **Next Three Tooth:** \$3.00
   - **Last Two Tooth:** \$5.00
   - **Total:** \( \$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$5.00 = \$13.00 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{13.000}\)
