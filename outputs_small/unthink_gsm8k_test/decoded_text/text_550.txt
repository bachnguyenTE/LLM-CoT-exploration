Q: A shop sells school supplies. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the quantities and prices:**
   - **Notebook:** \$1.50 each
   - **Pen:** \$0.25 each
   - **Calculator:** \$12.00 each
   - **Geometry Set:** \$10.00 each

2. **Calculate the total cost for each item:**
   
   - **Notebooks:**
     \[
     5 \text{ notebooks} \times \$1.50 = \$7.50
     \]
   
   - ** Pens:**
     \[
     2 \text{ pens} \times \$0.25 = \$0.50
     \]
   
   - **Calculator:**
     \[
     1 \text{ calculator} \times \$12.00 = \$12.00
     \]
   
   - **Geometry Set:**
     \[
     1 \text{ geometry set} \times \$10.0 = \$10.00
     \]

3. **Sum up all the costs:**
   \[
   \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$29.50
   \]

4. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$29.50 = \$2.95
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = \$29.50 - \$2.95 = \$26.55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$26.55}
\]
