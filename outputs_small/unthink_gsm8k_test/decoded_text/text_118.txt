**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - **Containers imported:** 2
   - **Vehicles per container:** 5
   - **Total vehicles on the first day:** \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles

2. **Second Day:**
   - **Total vehicles after second day:** 30
   - **Total vehicles after first day:** 10
   - **Vehicles imported on the second day:** \(30 - 10 = 20\) vehicles

3. **Containers imported on the Second Day:**
   - Since each container holds 5 vehicles:
   \[
   \text{Containers} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
   \]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{4}\)
