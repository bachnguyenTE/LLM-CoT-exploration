To determine the number of kids in Soda, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Total Population**:  
   Soda has **23,786** inhabitants.

2. **Men and Women**:  
   - **Men**: 8,417  
   - **Women**: 9,092  

3. **Calculate Total Children**:  
   Subtract the number of men and women from the total population to find the number of children.

   \[
   \text{Number of Children} = \text{Total Population} - (\text{Number of Men} + \text{Number of Women})
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of Children} = 23,\!786 - (8,\!417 + 9,\!092)
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:  
   First, add the number of men and women:

   \[
   8,\!417 + 9,\!092 = 17,\!509
   \]

   Now, subtract this sum from the total population:

   \[
   23,\!786 - 17,\!509 = 6,\!267
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   There are **6,267** kids in Soda.

\[
\boxed{6,\!267}
