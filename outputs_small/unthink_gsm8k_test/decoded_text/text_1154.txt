**Solution:**

To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we'll break down his eating habits into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Mason eats **4 carrots** each day.
   - There are **5 weekdays** in a week.
   - **Total carrots on weekdays:** \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \)

2. **Weekend (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Mason eats **5 carrots** each day.
   - There are **2 weekend days**.
   - **Total carrots on weekends:** \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \)

3. **Total Carrots in a Week:**
   - **Weekdays total** + **Weekend total** = \( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
