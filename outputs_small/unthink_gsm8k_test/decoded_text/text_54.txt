It seems like there might be a bit of confusion in your question. Let's break it down step by step to find the correct answer.

**Given:**
- **Doubtfire sisters** are driving home with **7 kittens**.
- **Ad adopte** from the local animal shelter: **2 cats**.
  - **Patchy** has had **3 times the number of adopted kittens**.
  - **Trixie** has had **12 adopted kittens**.

**Question:**
How many kittens does the **Doubtfire family** now have?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Kittens from Adopted Cats:**
   - Patchy has had **3 times the number of adopted kittens**.
   - Trixie has had **12 adopted kittens**.
   - Let’s denote the number of adopted kittens as **x**.
   - According to the problem, **3x = 12**.
   - Solving for **x**:
     \[
     x = \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]
   - So, **Patchy** has had **3x = 3 \times 4 = 12** adopted kittens**.

2. **Total Kittens from Adopted Cats:**
   - **Patchy** has had **12** adopted kittens.
   - **Trixie** has had **12** adopted kittens.
   - **Total**:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24
     \]

3. **Total Kittens for the Doubtfire Family:**
   - The **Doubtfire sisters** are driving home with **7 kittens**.
   - **Total Kittens**:
     \[
     24 \text{ (from adopted cats)} + 7 \text{ (Doubtfire sisters)} = 31
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
