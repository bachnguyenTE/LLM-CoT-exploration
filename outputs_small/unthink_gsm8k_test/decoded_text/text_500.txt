Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi: 43
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
- Then, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- Since David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

**Set up the equation:**
\[
D \ (\text{David}) + (D + 7) \ (\text{Lily}) + 2D \ (\text{Bodhi}) = 43
\]

**Simplify the equation:**
\[
D + D + 7 + 2D = 43
\]
\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

**Solve for \( D \):**
\[
4D = 43 - 7
\]
\[
4D = 36
\]
\[
D = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

**Find the number of insects Lily found:**
\[
\text{Lily} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
