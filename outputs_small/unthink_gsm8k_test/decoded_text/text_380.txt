To determine how much Karan has to pay each month, we'll calculate the total amount to be repaid and then divide it by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the Total Interest:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \$3,650 \times 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \$75.42
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \$3,650 + \$75.42 = \$3,725.42
   \]

3. **Calculate the Monthly Payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{\$3,725.42}{5} = \$745.08
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$745.08}
\]
