Let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after spending.

**Given:**
- **Maggie** spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her money.
- **Riza** spent \( \frac{1}{3} \) of her money.
- **Both** had \$60 initially.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent by Maggie.**

Maggie spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \$60.

\[
\text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining money with Maggie.**

\[
\text{Remaining money with Maggie} = 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount spent by Riza.**

Riza spent \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \$60.

\[
\text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining money with Riza.**

\[
\text{Remaining money with Riza} = 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step5: Calculate the total money left with both Maggie and Riza.**

\[
\text{Total money left} = 45 + 40 = 85 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{85}
\]
