**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
   - Let \( P \) represent the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
   - Rose bought **12 onions** and **4 potatoes**.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
     \[
     \text{Onions bought by Rose} = 4S = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{Potatoes bought by Rose} = 4P = 4
     \]

4. **Solve for \( S \) and \( P \):**
   - For onions:
     \[
     4S = 12 \implies S = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For potatoes:
     \[
     4P = 4 \implies P = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]

5. **Total Number of Vegetables Sophia Bought:**
   \[
   S + P = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
