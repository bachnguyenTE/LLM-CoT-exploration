To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, let's break down the requirements step by step.

1. **Total number of seniors:** 44

2. **Cost per picture frame:** \$20

3. **Additional cost for etching:** 20% of the frame cost.

   - **Total cost per frame:** \$20 + (20% of \$20) = \$20 + \$4.80 = **\$24.80**

4. **2 seniors will receive pins:** Each pin costs \$5.

   - **Total cost for pins:** 2 × \$5 = **\$10.00**

5. **1/4 of the seniors are officers:** Each officer needs a cord costing \$12.

   - **Number of officers:** 44 × (1/4) = **11**
   - **Total cost for cords:** 11 × \$12 = **\$132.00**

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - **Total cost for picture frames:** 44 × \$24.80 = **\$1,083.20**
   - **Total cost for pins:** \$10.00
   - **Total cost for cords:** \$132.00

   - **Total expenditure:** \$1,083.20 + \$10.00 + \$132.00 = **\$1,325.20**

**Final Answer:** \boxed{\$1,325.20}
