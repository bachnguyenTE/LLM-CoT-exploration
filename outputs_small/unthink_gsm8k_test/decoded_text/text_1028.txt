Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Tom has to pay per month.

1. **Initial Cost of the Bedroom Set:**
   - Tom buys a bedroom set for **\$3,000** (assuming a typo, it's likely \$3,000).

2. **Selling His Old Bedroom:**
   - Tom sells his old bedroom for **\$1,000**.
   - **Amount Received:** \$1,000

3. **Amount Left to Pay for the Bedroom Set:**
   - Total cost: \$3,000
   - Amount received: \$1,000
   - **Remaining Amount to Pay:** \$3,000 - \$1,000 = **\$2,000**

4. **Monthly Payment for the Bedroom Set:**
   - Tom has to pay **10%** (10%) a month for the bedroom set.
   - **Monthly Payment:** 10% of \$2,000
   - **Calculation:** 0.10 × \$2,000 = **\$2,300**

5. **Final Amount to Pay Per Month:**
   - **Answer:** Tom has to pay **\$2,300** per month.

\boxed{2300}
