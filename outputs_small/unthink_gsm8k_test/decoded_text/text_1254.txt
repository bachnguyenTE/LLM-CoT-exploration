Q: Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?

To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry with the new varnish, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Old Varnish:**
     - Time to apply: 7 minutes per painting.
     - Time to dry: 7 minutes per painting.
   - **New Varnish:**
     - Time to apply: 12 minutes per painting.
     - Time to dry: 12 minutes per painting.

2. **Calculate the Total Drying Time for 6 Paintings with the Old Varnish:**
   - **Time per painting:** 7 minutes.
   - **Total time:** \( 6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the Total Drying Time for 6 Paintings with the New Varnish:**
   - **Time per painting:** 12 minutes.
   - **Total time:** \( 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Determine the Difference in Drying Time:**
   - **Difference:** \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

**Final Answer:** It will take **30 minutes longer** for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.
