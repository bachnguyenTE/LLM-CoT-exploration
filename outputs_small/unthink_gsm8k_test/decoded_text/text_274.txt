**Solution:**

To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan spent on buying the vegetable seeds, we'll calculate the cost of each type of seed separately and then sum them up.

1. **Tomato Seeds:**
   - Number of packets: 20
   - Cost per packet: \$40
   - Total cost for tomato seeds: \( 20 \times 40 = \$800 \)

2. **Celery Seeds:**
   - Number of packets: 80
   - Cost per packet: \$30
   - Total cost for celery seeds: \( 80 \times 30 = \$2400 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of both costs: \( \$800 + \$2400 = \$3280 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$3280}
\]
