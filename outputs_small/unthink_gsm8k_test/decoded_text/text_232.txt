**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Number of **Ants** = 50
   - Number of **Bugs** = Half the number of ants

2. **Calculate the number of bugs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects:**
   \[
   \text{Total Insects} = \text{Number of Ants} + \text{Number of Bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
