Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people think horse #12 will win.

1. **Total number of people:** 500

2. **People who think horse #2 will win:**
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 110 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Remaining people after horse #2:**
   \[
   500 - 110 = 390 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **People who think horse #7 will win from the remaining:**
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 390 = 0.60 \times 390 = 234 \text{ people}
   \]

5. **Remaining people after horse #7:**
   \[
   390 - 234 = 156 \text{ people}
   \]

6. **People who think horse #12 will win from the remaining:**
   \[
   100\% \text{ of } 156 = 1.00 \times 156 = 156 \text{ people}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{156}
\]
