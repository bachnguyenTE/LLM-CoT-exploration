Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.
- Martha bought 5 more notebooks, making the total number of notebooks she has 7.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( M \) be the number of notebooks Martha originally had.
- Therefore, Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

**After Martha bought more notebooks:**
- Martha bought 5 more notebooks.
- Total notebooks Martha has now: \( M + 5 = 7 \).

**Step 1: Find the original number of notebooks Martha had.**
\[
M + 5 = 7 \\
M = 7 - 5 \\
M = 2
\]

**Step 2: Determine Joseph's original number of notebooks.**
\[
\text{Joseph} = 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph.**
\[
\text{Martha's notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
