   - **Email Invitations:** 100 people.

2. **Friends Invited:**
   - **10 of her friends** are called to invite **their friends**.
   - **8 of them** say they will be bringing their **spouses**.

3. **Calculating Total Invitations:**

   - **Friends Invited:** 10 people.
   - **Spouses Invited:** 8 people.
