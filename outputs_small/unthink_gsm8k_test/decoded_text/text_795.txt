Q: Mike needed a new pair of jeans.  When he got to the mall he saw that his favorite jeans were advertised 25% off.  The original price of the jeans was $40.  How much money will Mike have left over if he pays with a $50.00 bill?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the discount amount:**
   
   The original price of the jeans is \$40, and there's a 25% discount.
   
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 25\% \times \$40 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.25
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the discounted price:**
   
   Subtract the discount from the original price.
   
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \$40 - \$10.25 = \$39.75
   \]
   
3. **Find out how much money Mike will have left:**
   
   Mike pays with a \$50 bill.
   
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \$55 - \$39.75 = \$15.25
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$15.25}
\]
