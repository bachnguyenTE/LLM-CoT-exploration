**Solution:**

Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Steve's Age:**
   - Steve is **60 years old**.

2. **Steve's Wife's Age:**
   - Steve's wife is **4 years older** than Steve.
   - **Wife's Age = Steve's Age + 4 years**
   - **Wife's Age = 60 + 4 = 68 years**

3. **Steve's Son's Age:**
   - The **son is currently half as old as his mom**.
   - **Son's Age = (1/2) * Wife's Age**
   - **Son's Age = (1/2) * 68 = 34 years**

4. **Steve's Son's Wife's Age:**
   - The **wife is 3 years younger** than her husband.
   - **Wife's Age = Son's Age - 3 years**
   - **Wife's Age = 34 - 3 = 31 years**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{31}
