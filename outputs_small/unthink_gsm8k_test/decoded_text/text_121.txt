**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morisette's Fruits:**
   - **Apples:** 5
   - **Oranges:** 8

2. **Kael's Fruits:**
   - **Apples:** Kael brought twice the number of apples Morisette did.
     - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) apples
   - **Oranges:** Kael brought half the number of oranges Morisette did.
     - \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) oranges

3. **Total Fruits:**
   - **Apples:** \( 5 + 10 = 15 \)
   - **Oranges:** \( 8 +4 = 12 \)
   - **Total Fruits:** \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{27}\)
