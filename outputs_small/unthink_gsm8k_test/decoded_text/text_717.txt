**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 6 pencils:**
   - Each pencil costs \$0.50.
   - For 6 pencils: 
     \[
     6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of 8 erasers:**
   - Each eraser costs \$0.25.
   - For 8 erasers:
     \[
     8 \times \$0.25 = \$2.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of pencils and erasers:**
   \[
   \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00
   \]

4. **Subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:**
   \[
   \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$4.75
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$4.75}
\]
