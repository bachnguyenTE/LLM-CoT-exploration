**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of coupon:**
   - **Small coupons:** Anthony wants to send out **700** small coupons.
   - **Big coupons:** He wants twice as many big coupons as small coupons. 
     \[
     \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for each type of coupon:**
   - **Cost per small coupon:** 5 cents.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - **Cost per big coupon:** 15 cents.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Find the total postage cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total postage cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]
   - **Convert cents to dollars:** 
     \[
     24500 \text{ cents} = \frac{24550}{100} = 245.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{245.50}
\]
