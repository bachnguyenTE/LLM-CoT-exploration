To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Candies in the Bag:**
   \[
   232 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Red Candies:**
   \[
   54 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Orange Candies:**
   \[
   \text{Twice the amount of red candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Yellow Candies:**
   \[
   \text{Half as many as red candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Total Non-Pink Candies:**
   \[
   \text{Red} + \text{Orange} + \text{Yellow} = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pink Candies:**
   \[
   \text{Total Candies} - \text{Non-Pink Candies} = 232 - 189 = 43 \text{ pieces}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{43}
\]
