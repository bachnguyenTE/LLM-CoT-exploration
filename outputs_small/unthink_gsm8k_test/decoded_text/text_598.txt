**Solution:**

Colby wants to buy gumballs that cost **a nickel** (5 cents) each. He has the following coins:

- **8 quarters** (25 cents each)
- **6 dimes** (10 cents each)
- **14 nickels** (5 cents each)
- **15 pennies** (1 cent each)

To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then see how many nickels he can purchase with that amount.

1. **Calculate the total value of each type of coin:**

   - **Quarters:** \( 8 \times \$0.25 = \$2.00 \)
   - **Dimes:** \( 6 \times \$0.10 = \$0.660 \)
   - **Nickels:** \( 14 \times \$0.050 = \$7.70 \)
   - **Pennies:** \( 15 \times \$0.01 = \$0.15 \)

2. **Add up all the values to find the total amount of money:**

   \[
   \$2.00 + \$0.660 + \$7.70 + \$0.15 = \$10.45
   \]

3. **Determine how many gumballs (each costing 5 cents) Colby can buy with \$10.45:**

   \[
   \frac{\$10.45}{\$0.05 \text{ per gumball}} = 20 \text{ gumballs}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Colby can buy \(\boxed{22}\) gumballs.
