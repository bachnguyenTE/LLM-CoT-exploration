Q: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old Bill was when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.

1. **Comet Halley's Orbital Period:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every **75 years**.

2. **Father's Age When Comet Was First Seen:**
   - Let \( F \) be the father's age when Comet Halley was first seen.
   - Since Comet Halley orbits every 75 years, the next time it will be seen is in **75 years**.

3. **Bill's Ages When Comet Was Seen:**
   - **First Time:** Bill was **30 years old** when Comet Halley was first seen.
   - **Second Time:** Bill saw Comet Halley again when he was **three times the age** his father was when he first saw it.

4. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw Comet Halley for the second time.
   - According to the problem, \( B = 3F \).

5. **Total Time Between Seeing the Comet Twice:**
   - The first time was when the father was \( F \) years old.
   - The second time was when the father was \( F + 75 \) years old.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 75 \) years.

6. **Relating Bill's Ages:**
   - The first time: Bill was \( 30 \) years old.
   - The second time: Bill was \( B \) years old.
   - The difference in their ages is \( B - 30 = B - 30 \) years.

7. **Equating the Two Expressions for the Age Difference:**
   - \( B - 30 = 75 \)
   - \( B = 75 + 30 \)
   - \( B = 105 \)

8. **Finding the Father's Age When Comet Was First Seen:**
   - Since \( B = 3F \), and \( B = 105 \):
   - \( 105 = 3F \)
   - \( F = \frac{105}{3} \)
   - \( F = 35 \)

9. **Verifying the Ages:**
   - First sighting: Father was \( 35 \) years old, Bill was \(30\).
   - Second sighting: Father was \(35 + 75 = 110\) years old, Bill was \(105\).

10. **Conclusion:**
    - Bill was **30 years old** when he saw Comet Halley for the first time.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{30}\)
