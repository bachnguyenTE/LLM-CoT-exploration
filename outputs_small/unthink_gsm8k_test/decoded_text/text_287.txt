To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Stars on the Flag:** 76 stars.
2. **Structure of the Flag:**
   - **First Row:** 8 stars.
   - **Second Row:** 6 stars.
   - **Third Row:** 5 stars.
   - **Fourth Row:** 5 stars.
   - **Fifth Row:** 5 stars.

3. **Calculating the Total Stars:**
   - **First Row:** 8 stars.
   - **Second Row:** 6 stars.
   - **Third Row:** 5 stars.
   - **Fourth Row:** 5 stars.
   - **Fifth Row:** 5 stars.

   Adding these together:
   \[
   8 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 29 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. **Comparing with the Total Stars:**
   - The flag has a total of 76 stars.
