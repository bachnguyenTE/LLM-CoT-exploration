**Solution:**

Mike plays ping pong for a total of **40 minutes**. The scoring is broken down into two equal parts:

1. **First 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores **4 points**.

2. **Second 20 minutes:**
   - He scores **25% more points** than in the first 20 minutes.
   - **25% of 4 points** is calculated as:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points scored:**
   - Adding both parts together:
     \[
     4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
