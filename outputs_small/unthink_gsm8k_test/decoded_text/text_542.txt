Let's calculate Verna's change step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of each type of fruit:**
   - **Apples:** 
     \[
     3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50/\text{apple} = \$4.50
     \]
   - **Oranges:**
     \[
     5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80/\text{orange} = \$4.00
     \]
   - **Peaches:**
     \[
     6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75/\text{peach} = \$4.50
     \]

2. **Add up the total cost:**
   \[
   \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Verna gave:**
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$6.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{\$6.00}
