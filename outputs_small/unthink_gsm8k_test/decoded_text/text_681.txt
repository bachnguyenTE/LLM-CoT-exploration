Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Katarina has 68 cookies.

**Step 1: Determine how many cookies Max has.**

We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Let's denote:
- \( K \) = number of cookies Katarina has
- \( M \) = number of cookies Max has

From the first statement:
\[ K = M - 5 \]

We are given that \( K = 68 \), so:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies the Cookie Monster has.**

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Let's denote:
- \( C \) = number of cookies the Cookie Monster has

From the second statement:
\[ M = C + 12 \]

We found that \( M = 73 \), so:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many cookies Summer has.**

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. From the third statement:
\[ S = M + 23 \]

We found that \( M = 73 \), so:
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies.**

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68
- Max: 73
- Cookie Monster: 61
- Summer: 96

\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 238 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{238}
\]
