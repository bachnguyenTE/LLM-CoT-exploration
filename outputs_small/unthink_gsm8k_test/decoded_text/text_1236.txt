Q: Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of grapes at the beginning.

1. **Madeline's Grapes:**
   - Madeline ate **6 grapes**.

2. **Her Brother's Grapes:**
   - Her brother used **5 times** as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice.
   - **Grapes used by brother** = \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) grapes.

3. **Total Grapes Used for Juice:**
   - **Total grapes used** = Grapes eaten by Madeline + Grapes used by brother
   - **Total grapes used** = \( 6 + 30 = 36 \) grapes.

4. **Remaining Grapes for Pies:**
   - After making juice, the remaining grapes were used to make **4 pies**.
   - **Grapes per pie** = 12 grapes.
   - **Total grapes for pies** = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) grapes.

5. **Total Grapes at the Beginning:**
   - **Total grapes** = Grapes eaten by Madeline + Grapes used for juice + Grapes for pies
   - **Total grapes** = \( 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \) grapes.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{84}\)
