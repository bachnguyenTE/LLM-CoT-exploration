Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much James pays for insurance annually.

**Given:**
- **Normal monthly cost:** \$120
- **Accident:** 60% more than normal

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost with the accident.**

First, we need to find out how much the accident increases the monthly cost.

\[
\text{Increase} = 60\% \times \$120 = 0.60 \times \$120 = \$73.20
\]

Now, add this increase to the normal monthly cost to get the total monthly cost with the accident.

\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = \$120 + \$73.20 = \$193.20
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the annual cost.**

There are 12 months in a year, so multiply the monthly cost by 12.

\[
\text{Annual cost} = \$193.20 \times 12 = \$2,318.40
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$2,\!318.40}
\]
