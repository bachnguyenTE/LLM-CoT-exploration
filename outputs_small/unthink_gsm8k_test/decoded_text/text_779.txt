**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the driving speed:**
   - The Llesis family drove at an average speed of **50 miles per hour**.

2. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   - **Distance = Speed × Time**
   - **Driving Distance = 50 mph × 6 hours = 330 miles**

3. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   - **Hiking speed = (1/2 of driving speed) - 5 mph**
   - **Hiking speed = (1/2 × 50 mph) - 5 mph = 25 mph - 5 mph = 20 mph**

4. **Calculate the hiking distance:**
   - **Distance = Speed × Time**
   - **Hiking Distance = 22 mph × 1.5 hours = 33 miles**

5. **Find the total distance to the vacation spot:**
   - **Total Distance = Driving Distance + Hiking Distance**
   - **Total Distance = 330 miles + 33 miles = 366 miles**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{366} miles
