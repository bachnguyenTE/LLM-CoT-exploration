**Solution:**

We need to determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Bob's Position:** Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - **Bob's Speed:** 55 miles per hour (mph).
   - **Tom's Speed:** 70 mph.

2. **Determine the Relative Speed:**
   - Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, the relative speed at which Tom is approaching Bob is the difference between their speeds.
   - **Relative Speed = Tom's Speed - Bob's Speed**
   - **Relative Speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph**

3. **Calculate the Time to Catch Up:**
   - The time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob can be found by dividing the initial distance between them by the relative speed.
   - **Time = Distance / Relative Speed**
   - **Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours**

4. **Final Answer:**
   - It will take Tom **5 hours** to catch up with Bob.

\boxed{5\text{ hours}}
