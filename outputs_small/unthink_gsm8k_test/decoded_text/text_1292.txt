Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how tall Jackie was before summer.

1. **Albert's Height:**
   - Albert is given as **36 inches** tall.

2. **Anne's Height:**
   - Anne is **twice the size** of Albert.
   - **Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height**
   - **Anne's height = 2 × 36 inches = 72 inches**

3. **Jackie's Height Before Summer:**
   - Jackie is **2 inches shorter** than Anne.
   - **Jackie's height before summer = Anne's height - 2 inches**
   - **Jackie's height before summer = 72 inches - 2 inches = 70 inches**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{70\text{ inches}}
\]
