Q: Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the relay race.

**Given:**
- **Aaron** runs each mile twice as fast as **Vanessa**.
- **Vanessa** runs **twice as far** as Aaron did.
- **Vanessa** ran **4 miles**.
- **Aaron** completed his part of the race in **16 minutes**.

**Let’s define some variables to make this clearer:**

- Let \( V \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
- Then, **Aaron's speed** would be \( 2V \) since he runs twice as fast.

**First, determine the distance each person ran:**

- **Vanessa** ran **4 miles**.
- **Aaron** ran **twice as far** as Vanessa, so **Aaron ran** \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) miles.

**Next, calculate the time each person took to complete their part of the race:**

- **Aaron** completed his 8 miles in **16 minutes**.
- **Vanessa** completed her 4 miles in \( T \) minutes.

**Since speed is distance divided by time, we can set up the following equations:**

For **Aaron**:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \Rightarrow 2V = \frac{8}{16} \quad \text{(since 16 minutes is } \frac{16}{60} \text{ hours, but let's keep it in minutes for simplicity)}
\]

Wait, actually, let's correct that. The units need to be consistent. Let's convert everything to minutes.

- **Aaron's speed** is \( 2V \) miles per minute.
- **Aaron's time** is 16 minutes.
- **Aaron's distance** is 8 miles.

So, using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \Rightarrow 2V = \frac{8}{16}
\]
\[
2V = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow V = 0.25 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

**Now, find Vanessa's time:**

- **Vanessa's speed** is \( V = 0.25 \) miles per minute.
- **Vanessa's distance** is 4 miles.
- **Vanessa's time** \( T \) is:
\[
T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{0.25} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
