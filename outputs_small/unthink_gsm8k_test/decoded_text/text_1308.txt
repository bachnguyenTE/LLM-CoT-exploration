</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Basket:**
   - Number of eggs = 10

2. **Second Basket:**
   - It says there are **twice as many eggs** in the second basket as in the first one.
   - So, the number of eggs in the second basket = 2 × 10 = 20

3. **Total Eggs in Both Baskets:**
   - Total = Number of eggs in first basket + Number of eggs in second basket
   - Total = 10 + 20 = 32

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32}
