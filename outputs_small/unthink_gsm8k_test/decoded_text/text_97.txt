**Solution:**

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   
   - Total sauce produced: 32 ounces.
   - Canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the volume of tomatoes used is twice the volume of the sauce.
   
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes used} = 2 \times 32\,000 \text{ ounces} = 64,000 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes used:**
   
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Number of tomatoes = Total tomatoes used / Tomatoes per can.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of tomatoes} = \frac{64,000}{3} \approx 21,333
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   
   Freda used approximately **21,333 tomatoes**.

\[
\boxed{21,\!333}
\]
