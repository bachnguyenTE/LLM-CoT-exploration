**Solution:**

To determine what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time needed to clean all classrooms:**
   
   - **Number of classrooms:** 80
   - **Time per classroom:** 15 minutes
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 400 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the total cleaning time into hours:**
   
   \[
   440 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 7.333\ldots \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7.333\ldots}{8} \right) \times 100\% \approx 91.67\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{91.67\%}
\]
