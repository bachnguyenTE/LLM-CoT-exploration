To determine the profit the merchant can make by choosing between the two purchase plans, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Purchase Amounts:**
   - **Jewelry:** \$5,000
   - **Electronic Gadgets:** \$8,000

2. **Determine the Market Performance:**
   - **Jewelry Market:** Increases by 2.5%
   - **Electronic Gadgets Market:** Increases by 1.2%

3. **Calculate the Profit for Each Option:**
   
   - **For Jewelry:**
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Purchase Amount} \times \text{Market Increase} = 5,000 \times 2.5\% = 5,000 \times 0.025 = 125
     \]
     So, the profit from jewelry is **\$125**.

   - **For Electronic Gadgets:**
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Purchase Amount} \times \text{Market Increase} = 8,000 \times 1.2\% = 8,000 \times 0.012 = 96
     \]
     So, the profit from electronic gadgets is **\$96**.

4. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   
   Comparing the profits:
   - Jewelry: \$125
   - Electronic Gadgets: \$96

   The merchant can make a **maximum profit of \$125** by choosing the jewelry purchase plan.

\boxed{125}
