**Solution:**

We are given that Katy uses a ratio of **7:13** for sugar to water. This means for every **7 parts** of sugar, she uses **13 parts** of water.

Let’s denote:
- The number of parts of sugar as **7x**.
- The number of parts of water as **13x**.

The total parts used are:
\[
7x + 13x = 20x
\]

We are told that the total amount of sugar and water used is **120** parts. Therefore:
\[
20x = 120
\]

Solving for **x**:
\[
x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

Now, the number of parts of sugar is:
\[
7x = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{42}
\]
