**Solution:**

To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large face masks, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the material required per small and large mask:**

   - **Small masks:** Jo uses 2 yards of material to make 4 small masks.
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
     \]
   
   - **Large masks:** Jo uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 large masks.
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks:**
   \[
   20 \text{ small masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks:**
   \[
   8 \text{ large masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
   \]

4. **Add the materials together to find the total required:**
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ yards}}
\]
