To determine how many people John lost to in arm wrestling, follow these steps:

1. **Total number of people John arm wrestled:** 20

2. **Percentage of people John won:** 80%

3. **Calculate the number of people John won:**

   \text{Number of wins} = 20 \times \frac{80}{100} = 20 \times 0.8 = 16
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of people John lost:**

   \text{Number of losses} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of wins} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

**Final Answer:** John lost to \boxed{4} people.
