Q: Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?

To determine the total time Richard will take to set off all the soda fountains, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Soda Bottles:**
   - Richard wants to place a bottle of diet soda every **3 feet** along a **24-foot** wide driveway.
   - **Number of soda bottles** = Total width / Distance between bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet = **8 bottles**.

2. **Time to Set Off Each Soda Fountain:**
   - After starting at the first bottle, it takes **5 seconds** to go from one soda bottle to the next.
   - Since there are **8 bottles**, the number of intervals between bottles is **7** (e.g., from bottle 1 to 2, 2 to 3, ..., 7 to 8).
   - **Total time** = Number of intervals × Time per interval = 7 × 5 seconds = **35 seconds**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{35\ \text{seconds}}
\]
