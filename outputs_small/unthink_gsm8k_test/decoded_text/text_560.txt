**Solution:**

We need to determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop. The pet shop has two types of cages:

1. **Cages with Hamsters:**
   - Number of cages: 3
   - Number of hamsters per cage: 10
   - Total hamsters: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

2. **Cages with Guinea Pigs:**
   - Number of cages: 3
   - Number of guinea pigs per cage: 5
   - Total guinea pigs: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

3. **Total Rodents:**
   - Total hamsters + Total guinea pigs = \( 30 + 15 = 45 \)

**Answer:** \(\boxed{45}\)
