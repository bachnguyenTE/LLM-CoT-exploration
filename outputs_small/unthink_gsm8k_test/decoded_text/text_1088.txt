To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of classes John has:**
   - Normally, there are 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - **Total classes = 6 + 2 = 8 classes.**

2. **Determine the total time spent in class each week:**
   - Each class is **40 minutes** long.
   - John attends **5 days a week** in class.
   - **Total class time = 8 classes × 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes.**

3. **Convert the total class time into hours:**
   - **Total class time in hours = 320 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour ≈ 5.333 hours.**

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends **1/16 of his weekly minutes** on Saturday and Sunday.
   - **Extra learning time = 5.333 hours × (1/16) ≈ 0.0555 hours.**

5. **Find the total weekly learning time:**
   - **Total weekly learning time = 5.333 hours + 0.0555 hours ≈ 5.388 hours.**

6. **Convert the total time into hours:**
   - **Total weekly learning time ≈ 5.388 hours.**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{5.388} \text{ hours per week}
