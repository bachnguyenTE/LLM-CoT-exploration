Let's determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest step by step.

1. **Diamonds:**
   - **Given:** 175 diamonds.

2. **Rubies:**
   - **Given:** There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     \text{Rubies} = \text{Diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
     \]
   - **Total Rubies:** 140.

3. **Emeralds:**
   - **Given:** There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     \text{Emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280
     \]
   - **Total Emeralds:** 280.

4. **Total Gems:**
   - **Summing up all gems:**
     \[
     \text{Total Gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 600
     \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{600}\)
