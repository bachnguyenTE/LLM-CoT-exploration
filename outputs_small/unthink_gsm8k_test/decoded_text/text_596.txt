Q: George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?

To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Implants:**
   - Each implant costs \$2000.
   - Total for two implants: \( 2 \times \$2000 = \$4000 \).

2. **Additional Cost for a Crown:**
   - The crown costs an extra \$500.
   - Total cost for dental work: \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

3. **Deposit:**
   - Deposit paid: \$600.
   - Remaining amount to be covered: \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3850 \).

4. **Earnings from Work:**
   - Hourly wage: \$15 per hour.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hours needed to work.
   - Total earnings: \( 15h \).

5. **Equation to Find Hours:**
   \[
   15h = 3850
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{3850}{15} = 257
   \]

**Final Answer:** George needs to work \(\boxed{257}\) hours.
