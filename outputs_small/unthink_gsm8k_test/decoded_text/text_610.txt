**Solution:**

To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost for Monica's street:**
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{Monica}} = \text{Cost per meter} \times \text{Length of Monica's street}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{Monica}} = \$194 \times 150 \, \text{m} = \$29,340
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for Lewis' street:**
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{Lewis}} = \text{Cost per meter} \times \text{Length of Lewis' street}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{Lewis}} = \$194 \times 490 \,00 \, \text{m} = \$96,060
   \]

3. **Find the difference in cost:**
   \[
   \Delta \text{Cost} = \text{Cost}_{\text{Lewis}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Monica}}
   \]
   \[
   \Delta \text{Cost} = \$96,060 - \$29,340 = \$66,60
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$66.60}
\]
