Q: Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?

To determine how many shells the **Gogetters** found, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Shells Found:**  
   There are **700 shells** in total.

2. **Team Alphas:**  
   They found **40%** of the shells.  
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.4 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells}
   \]

3. **Remaining Shells After Alphas:**  
   Subtract the shells found by the Alphas from the total.  
   \[
   700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells}
   \]

4. **Team The Finders:**  
   They found **60%** of the remaining shells.  
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.6 \times 420 = 253.2 \text{ shells}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a shell, we'll consider this as **253 shells**.

5. **Shells Left for Team Gogetters:**  
   Subtract the shells found by the The Finders from the remaining shells.  
   \[
   420 - 253 = 167 \text{ shells}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{167}
\]
