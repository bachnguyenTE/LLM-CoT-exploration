**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total amount Johnny had before investing:**
   
   - **Initial allowance:** \$20
   - **Extra money added:** \$10
   
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \$20 + \$10 = \$30
   \]

2. **Determine the amount after the investment:**
   
   - **Investment triples the amount:**
     
     \[
     \text{Investment amount} = 3 \times \$30 = \$90
     \]

3. **Final amount after one year:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{\$90}
   \]
