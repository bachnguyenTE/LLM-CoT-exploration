**Solution:**

1. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries.
   - Total monthly expenditure: \$400.

2. **Madeline's Share:**
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Calculation: \( 60\% \) of \$400.
   - \( 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Keenan's Share:**
   - Since the total is \$400 and Madeline pays \$240, Keenan pays the remaining.
   - Calculation: \$400 - \$240 = \$156.

4. **Weekly Cost:**
   - The month is four weeks long.
   - Weekly cost for Keenan: \( \frac{156}{4} = 39 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
Keenan spends **\$39** per week.
