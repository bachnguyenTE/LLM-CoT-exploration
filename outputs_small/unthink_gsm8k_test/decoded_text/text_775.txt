To determine how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles the toys, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:**
   - Each car requires 4 wheels.
   - Henry needs to assemble **57** cars.
   - **Total wheels for cars** = \( 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels/car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:**
   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
   - Henry needs to assemble **73** motorcycles.
   - **Total wheels for motorcycles** = \( 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all toys:**
   - **Total wheels needed** = \( 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \).

4. **Determine the number of wheels left in the box:**
   - **Total wheels in the box** = \( 650 \text{ wheels} \).
   - **Wheels left** = \( 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{276}\)
