**Solution:**

Let's denote:
- \( W \) as Mark's initial weight.
- Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.
- His final weight is 70 pounds.

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\text{Initial Weight} - (\text{Weight Loss per Month} \times \text{Number of Months}) = \text{Final Weight}
\]

Plugging in the known values:

\[
W - (10 \times 3) = 70
\]

\[
W - 30 = 70
\]

To find \( W \), add 30 to both sides:

\[
W = 70 + 30
\]

\[
W = 107
\]

**Answer:** Mark's initial weight was \(\boxed{107}\) pounds.
