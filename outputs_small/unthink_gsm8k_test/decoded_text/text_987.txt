To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total soil available:** 30 pounds
- **Roses needed per rose:** 1 pound
- **Carnations needed per carnation:** 1.5 pounds
- **Sunflowers needed per sunflower:** 3 pounds
- **Number of sunflowers planted:** 4
- **Number of carnations planted:** 10

**Step 1: Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations.**

\[
\text{Soil used for sunflowers} = 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Soil used for carnations} = 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total soil used} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining soil available for roses.**

\[
\text{Remaining soil} = 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining soil.**

\[
\text{Number of roses} = \frac{3 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ pound/rose}} = 3 \text{ roses}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
