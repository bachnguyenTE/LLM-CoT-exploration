To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we can break down the information provided:

1. **Number of Vacations:**
   - Gene has been on **four vacations a year**.
   - He has been **23 years old** when he started.
   - He is now **34 years old**.

2. **Calculating the Number of Years:**
   - **Years of Service:** \( 34 - 23 = 11 \) years.

3. **Total Quilt Blocks:**
   - Since he has one shirt (quilt block) from each vacation he has been on, and he has been on **four vacations a year** for **11 years**, the total number of quilt blocks is:
     \[
     4 \text{ blocks/year} \times 11 \text{ year} = 44 \text{ blocks}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
