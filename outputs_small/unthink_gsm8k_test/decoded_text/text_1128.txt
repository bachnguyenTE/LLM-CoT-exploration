Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Liam is currently 16 years old.
- Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( L \) be Liam's current age.
- Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.

**From the problem:**
1. **Liam's current age:**
   \[
   L = 16
   \]
2. **Two years ago:**
   - Liam's age was \( L - 2 \).
   - Vince's age was \( V - 2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( L - 2 = 2(V - 2) \).

**Substitute \( L = 16 \) into the equation:**
\[
16 - 2 = 2(V - 2)
\]
\[
4 = 2V - 4
\]

**Solve for \( V \):**
\[
4 + 4 = 2V
\]
\[
8 = 2V
\]
\[
V = 4
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
