Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- On **Monday**, Walt walked **4 miles**.
- On **Tuesday**, he walked **6 times** as many miles as he did on Monday.
- The **total mileage** from **Monday** through **Wednesday** was **41 miles**.

**Let’s define:**
- Let \( M \) represent the miles walked on Monday.
- Let \( T \) represent the miles walked on Tuesday.
- Let \( W \) represent the miles walked on Wednesday.

**Step 1: Calculate the miles walked on Tuesday.**
\[
T = 6 \times M = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 2: Set up the equation for the total mileage from Monday to Wednesday.**
\[
M + T + W = 41
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
4 + 24 + W = 41
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( W \).**
\[
28 + W = 41 \\
W = 41 - 28 \\
W = 13 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
