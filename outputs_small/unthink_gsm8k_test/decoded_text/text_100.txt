The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Friend:**
   - Pressed **20 times**.

2. **Second Friend:**
   - Pressed **1/4 times more** than the first friend.
   - Calculation: \(20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5\)
   - Total presses: \(20 + 5 = 25\)

3. **Fourth Friend:**
   - Pressed **60 times**.

4. **Third Friend:**
   - Pressed **10 times more** than the fourth friend.
   - Calculation: \(60 \times 10 = 600\)

5. **Total Doorbell Rings:**
   - Sum of all presses: \(20 + 25 + 60 + 60 = 153\)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{153}\)
