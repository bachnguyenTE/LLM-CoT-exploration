**Solution:**

James wants to buy birthday candles for his two sons. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Age of the Sons:**
   - **Son 1:** 12 years old
   - **Son 2:** 4 years younger than Son 1, so \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old

2. **Number of Candles Needed:**
   - Each son needs 1 candle.
   - **Total Candles:** \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - A pack of 5 candles costs \$3.
   - Number of packs needed: \(\frac{20}{5} = 4.4\) packs. Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, James needs to buy 5 packs.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Each pack costs \$3, so \(5 \times 3 = \$15\)

**Final Answer:**  
James spends **\$15** on candles.
