Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. How old is his son?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the son's age.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the son's age.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     45 = 2S - 5
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     45 + 5 = 2S
     \]
     \[
     50 = 2S
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{50}{2}
     \]
     \[
     S = 25
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The son is **25 years old**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
