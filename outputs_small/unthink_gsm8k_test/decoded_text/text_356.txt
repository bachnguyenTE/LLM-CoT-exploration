**Solution:**

1. **Initial Money:**
   - Dean starts with **\$28**.

2. **Cost of Items:**
   - **6 toy cars:** Each costs **\$2**.
     - Total cost for toy cars = \(6 \times \$2 = \$12\).
   - **5 teddy bears:** Each costs **\$1**.
     - Total cost for teddy bears = \(5 \times \$1 = \$5\).

3. **Total Expenditure:**
   - Total money spent = \$12 (toy cars) + \$5 (teddy bears) = **\$17**.

4. **Money After Purchase:**
   - Money left after buying toys = Initial money - Total expenditure = \$28 - \$17 = **\$11**.

5. **Additional Money Given:**
   - Dean's mother gives him an extra **\$10**.
   - Total money after receiving the gift = \$11 + \$1 = **\$12**.

6. **Final Amount:**
   - **\$12** is the amount of money Dean has left.

**Answer:** \(\boxed{12}\)
