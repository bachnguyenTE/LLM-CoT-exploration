**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Green Food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs **\$25**.
   - If you buy **3 baskets** of green food, the total cost is:
     \[
     3 \times \$25 = \$15
     \]

2. **Cost of Red Food:**
   - Each basket of red food costs **\$18**.
   - If you buy **3 baskets** of red food, the total cost is:
     \[
     3 \times \$18 = \$54
     \]

3. **Total Cost Before Discount:**
   - Add the cost of green food and red food:
     \[
     \$15 + \$54 = \$69
     \]

4. **Discount:**
   - You get **\$2 off** for each basket of red food.
   - Since you bought **3 baskets** of red food, the total discount is:
     \[
     3 \times \$2 = \$6
     \]

5. **Total Cost After Discount:**
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount:
     \[
     \$69 - \$6 = \$63
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$63}
\]
