Q: Boris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?

**Solution:**

Boris produces chocolate bars over four weeks. Let's break down his production each week:

1. **First Week:**
   - **Production:** 8,000 bars
   - **Total Production:** 8,000 bars

2. **Second Week:**
   - **Production:** Half of the first week
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
   - **Total Production:** 4,000 bars

3. **Third Week:**
   - **Production:** Three times the first week
   - **Calculation:** \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars
   - **Total Production:** 24,000 bars

4. **Fourth Week:**
   - **Production:** We need to determine this based on the pattern established in the first three weeks.
   - **Pattern Analysis:**
     - Week 1: 8,000
     - Week2: 4,000 (which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} \))
     - Week3: 24,000 (which is \( 8,000 \times 3 \))
   - **Observation:** The production pattern alternates between halving and tripling from the previous week.
   - **Following the Pattern:**
     - Week4: \( 24,000 \times 2 = 48,000 \) bars

**Final Answer:**

Boris produces **48,000** chocolate bars in the fourth week.

\[
\boxed{48,\!000}
\]
