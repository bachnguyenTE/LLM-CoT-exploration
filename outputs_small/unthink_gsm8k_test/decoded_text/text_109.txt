**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at the gas station:**
   
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00
   \]

2. **Determine the cashback rewards:**
   
   - Cashback rate: 20%
   - Cashback amount:
     
     \[
     20\% \times \$30.00 = 0.20 \times \$30.00 = \$6.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount after cashback rewards:**
   
   \[
   \$30.00 - \$6.00 = \$24.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$24.00}
\]
