Let's determine how many more beads one sister has than the other.

**Given:**
- **Each pack** contains **20 beads**.
- **Elizabeth** bought:
  - 1 pack of **red beads**.
  - 2 packs of **clear beads**.
- **Margareth** bought:
  - 3 packs of **blue beads**.
  - 4 packs of **red beads**.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.**

- **Elizabeth's beads:**
  \[
  \text{Total} = (\text{Red packs} \times 20) + (\text{Clear packs} \times 20) = (1 \times 20) + (2 \times 20) = 20 + 40 = 68 \text{ beads}
  \]

- **Margareth's beads:**
  \[
  \text{Total} = (\text{Blue packs} \times 20) + (\text{Red packs} \times 20) = (3 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}
  \]

**Step 2: Determine the difference in the number of beads.**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Margareth's beads} - \text{Elizabeth's beads} = 140 - 68 = 72 \text{ beads}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{72}
\]
