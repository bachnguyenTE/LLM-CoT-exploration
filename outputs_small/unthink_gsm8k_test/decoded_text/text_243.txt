Q: Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Phone Minutes Available:**
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Minutes Used Daily:**
   - **With Boss:** 15 minutes per day
   - **Other People:** Let's assume this is a separate category. However, the problem doesn't specify how many minutes Jason spends on other people. For the sake of this problem, we'll consider that the 300 extra minutes are already accounted for, and we'll focus on the minutes used with his boss.

3. **Minutes Used Daily with Boss:**
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

4. **Total Minutes Used Daily:**
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Minutes Left:**
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes} - 450 \text{ minutes} = 550 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{550}
\]
