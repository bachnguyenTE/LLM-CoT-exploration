**Solution:**

Martha collects **1 shell** every month starting from when she turned **5 years old**. We need to determine how many shells she will have collected by her **10th birthday**.

1. **Calculate the number of years between turning 5 and 10:**
   
   \[
   10 \text{ years} - 5 \text{ years} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of months in 5 years:**
   
   \[
   5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of shells collected:**
   
   Since she collects **1 shell** each month:
   
   \[
   60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
