**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Equipment Purchased:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = \$40,0000
   \]
   (Note: The amount is written as \$40,000 to represent 400000.)

2. **Faulty Equipment:**
   \[
   \text{Faulty} = 40\% \text{ of Total} = 0.40 \times 40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Faulty} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 164,000
   \]

3. **Functional Equipment:**
   \[
   \text{Functional} = \text{Total} - \text{Faulty} = 400,000 - 164,000 = 236,000
   \]

4. **Total Amount Spent on Restoring Functional Equipment:**
   \[
   \text{Total Spent} = \text{Functional} = \$236,000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$236,\!000}
\]
