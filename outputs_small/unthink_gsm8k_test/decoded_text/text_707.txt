To determine what percent of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total Water from the Colorado River:**
   - Let's assume the total water from the Colorado River is **100%** for simplicity.

2. **Water Used by the City:**
   - Colorado City uses **40%** of the total water from the river.

3. **Water Used for Industrial Purposes:**
   - **80%** of the water used by the city is for **industrial purposes**.
   - Therefore, the water used for **industrial purposes** is:
     \[
     40\% \times 88\% = 35.2\%
     \]

4. **Water Used for Non-Industrial Purposes:**
   - The total water used by the city is **40%** (from step 2).
   - Subtract the water used for industrial purposes (from step 3) to find the water used for non-industrial purposes:
     \[
     40\% - 35.2\% = 8.8\%
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, **8.8%** of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for **non-industrial purposes**.

\[
\boxed{8.8\%}
\]
