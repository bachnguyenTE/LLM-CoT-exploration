To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - A small sunflower has **3 dozen seeds**.
   - 1 dozen = 12 seeds.
   - So, 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = **36 seeds**.

2. **Determine the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - The large sunflower has **50% more seeds** than the small one.
   - 55% of 36 seeds = 0.55 × 36 = **19.8 seeds**.
   - Since you can't have a fraction of a seed, round to the nearest whole number: **20 seeds**.

3. **Find the total number of seeds:**
   - Small sunflower: 36 seeds
   - Large sunflower: 20 seeds
   - Total seeds = 36 + 20 = **56 seeds**

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{56}
