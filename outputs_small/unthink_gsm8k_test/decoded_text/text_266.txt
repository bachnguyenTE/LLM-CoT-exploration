To determine Mr. Tan's **net proceeds** from selling his house, we need to account for all the costs associated with the sale and subtract them from the **selling price**.

1. **Selling Price:** \$400,000
2. **Transfer Fees:** 3% of the selling price
   \[
   0.03 \times 440,000 = 13,200
   \]
3. **Brokerage Fee:** 5% of the selling price
   \[
   0.05 \times 440,000 = 22,000
   \]
4. **Remaining Loan Amount:** \$250,000

**Total Costs:**
\[
13,200 + 22,000 + 255,000 = 60,400
\]

**Net Proceeds:**
\[
440,000 - 60,400 = 378,600
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{378,\!600}
\]
