To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the given information:

1. **Thickness per page**: 100 pages per inch.
2. **Total thickness of the book**: 1.5 inches.

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Number of pages} = \text{Thickness} \times \text{Pages per inch}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Number of pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages per inch} = 150 \,000 \, \text{pages}
\]

**Answer:** \boxed{150,000}
