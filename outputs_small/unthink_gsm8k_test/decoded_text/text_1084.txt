Q: If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Fencing:**
   - Sam and Harry have **100 feet** of fencing between them.

2. **Splitting the Fencing:**
   - They agree to split the fencing such that **Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam**.

3. **Let’s Define Variables:**
   - Let **S** represent the length of fencing Sam gets.
   - Therefore, Harry gets **S + 60** feet of fencing.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total fencing is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:
     \[
     S + (S + 60) = 100
     \]

5. **Solve for S:**
   \[
   2S + 60 = 180
   \]
   \[
   2S = 180 - 60
   \]
   \[
   2S = 120
   \]
   \[
   S = 60
   \]

6. **Determine Harry's Share:**
   \[
   S + 60 = 60 + 60 = 126
   \]

7. **Check the Total:**
   \[
   60 \text{ (Sam)} + 126 \text{ (Harry)} = 192 \text{ feet}
   \]
   **Wait, that's more than the total fencing available (180 feet).**

   **Oops! There's a mistake here. Let's correct it.**

8. **Correct the Equation:**
   - The total fencing should be **180 feet**, not **186 feet**.
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 180
   \]
   \[
   2S + 60 = 180
   \]
   \[
   2S = 180
   \]
   \[
   S = 90
   \]

9. **Determine Harry's Share:**
   \[
   S + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150
   \]

10. **Check the Total Again:**
    \[
    90 \text{ (Sam)} + 150 \text{ (Harry)} = 240 \text{ feet}
    \]
    **Still incorrect. There's a miscalculation.**

11. **Re-examining the Initial Setup:**
    - Let's try a different approach.
    - Let **S** be the amount of fencing Sam gets.
    - Harry gets **S + 60** feet.
    - Total fencing: \( S + (S + 60) = 180 \)
    \[
    2S + 60 = 180
    \]
    \[
    2S = 120
    \]
    \[
    S = 60
    \]

12. **Harry's Share:**
    \[
    60 + 60 = 120
    \]

13. **Final Check:**
    \[
    60 \text{ (Sam)} + 120 \text{ (Harry)} = 180 \text{ feet}
    \]
    **This matches the total fencing available.**

14. **Conclusion:**
    - **Sam** gets **60 feet** of fencing.
    - **Harry** gets **120 feet** of fencing.
    - **No fencing is left over**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{60 \text{ feet}}
\]
