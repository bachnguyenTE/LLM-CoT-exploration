To determine the total number of students at the grade level, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer.**
2. **200 students do not have desktop computers.**

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \).

Since three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, the remaining one-fourth do not. Therefore, the number of students without desktop computers is:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 200
\]

To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 200 \times 4 = 800
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{800}\)
