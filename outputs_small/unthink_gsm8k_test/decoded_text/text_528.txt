Q: Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that they have.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Ophelia has **20 sofas**.
- Jenna has **2 fewer sofas than Ophelia**.
- Jenna has **3 times as many chairs as Ophelia**.

**Step 1: Determine the number of sofas Jenna has.**

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia:
\[
\text{Jenna's sofas} = \text{Ophelia's sofas} - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has.**

Let’s denote:
- \( O_s \) = number of sofas Ophelia has
- \( O_c \) = number of chairs Ophelia has
- \( J_s \) = number of sofas Jenna has
- \( J_c \) = number of chairs Jenna has

From the problem:
\[
J_s = O_s - 2
\]
\[
J_c = 3 \times O_c
\]

We know \( O_s = 20 \), so:
\[
J_s = 20 - 2 = 18
\]

**Step 3: Find the number of chairs Ophelia has.**

We need another equation to find \( O_c \). However, the problem doesn't provide a direct relationship between \( O_c \) and \( J_c \). Assuming that the number of chairs and sofas are related in a way that can be inferred from the given information, we can proceed.

Since the problem doesn't specify a direct relationship between chairs and sofas, we can only calculate the total number of sofas and chairs based on the given information.

**Total number of sofas:**
\[
\text{Total sofas} = O_s + J_s = 20 + 18 = 38
\]

**Total number of chairs:**
\[
\text{Total chairs} = O_c + J_c
\]
\[
J_c = 3 \times O_c
\]
\[
\text{Total chairs} = O_c + 3O_c = 4O_c
\]

However, without knowing the exact number of chairs Ophelia has, we cannot determine the exact total number of chairs. Therefore, we can only calculate the total number of sofas.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{38}
\]
