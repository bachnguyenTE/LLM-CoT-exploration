**Solution:**

Mary has a total of **30 sheep**.

- **First half of the sheep:** She gets **1 kg of milk** every day.
- **Second half of the sheep:** She gets **2 kg of milk** every day.

**Calculating the total milk collected daily:**

\text{Total milk} = (\text{Milk from first half}) + (\text{Milk from second half}) = 1\, \text{kg} + 2\, \text{kg} = 3\, \text{kg}
\]

**Answer:**

Mary collects **3 kg of milk** every day.
