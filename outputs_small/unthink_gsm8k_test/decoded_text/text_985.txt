**Solution:**

Edgar eats 18 pretzels every day. To find out how many he eats in a week, we need to calculate the total number of pretzels he consumes over 7 days.

1. **Calculate daily consumption:**
   \[
   18 \text{ pretzels/day}
   \]

2. **Multiply by the number of days in a week:**
   \[
   18 \text{ pretzels/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ pretzels/week}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{126}
\]
