Q: Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the information provided:

1. **5-year-old tree:** Produces **50 fruits**.
2. **6-year-old tree:** Produces **3 times the initial amount**. 
   - **Initial amount** = 50 fruits.
   - **6-year-old production** = 3 × 50 = **150 fruits**.
3. **7-year-old tree:** Produces **7 times the initial amount**.
   - **7-year-old production** = 7 × 55 = **385 fruits**.
4. **8-year-old tree:** Produces **200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree**.
   - Let’s denote the **10-year-old production** as **X**.
   - **8-year-old production** = X - 200.
5. **10-year-old tree:** Produces **20 times the initial amount**.
   - **10-year-old production** = 20 × 55 = **1100 fruits**.

Now, let's calculate the total production over the 10 years:

- **5 years:** 50 fruits
- **6 years:** 150 fruits
- **7 years:** 385 fruits
- **8 years:** X - 200 fruits
- **9 years:** 0 fruits (no production)
- **10 years:** 1100 fruits

Adding these together:

\[
\text{Total} = 50 + 150 + 385 + (X - 200) + 0 + 1100
\]

Simplify:

\[
\text{Total} = 50 + 150 + 385 + X - 200 + 1100
\]
\[
\text{Total} = (50 + 150 + 385) + (X - 200) + 1100
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 685 + X - 200 + 1100
\]
\[
\text{Total} = X + 1585
\]

However, since the **10-year-old production** is given as **1100 fruits**, we can set:

\[
X = 1100
\]

Therefore, the total production is:

\[
\text{Total} = 1100 + 1585 = 2685 \text{ fruits}
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{2685}\)
