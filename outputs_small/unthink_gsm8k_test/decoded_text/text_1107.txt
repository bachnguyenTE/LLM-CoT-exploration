To determine the number of girls in the school, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 40% of the school population are boys.
   - The number of boys is 240.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \( T \) represent the total number of students in the school.
   \[
   0.40 \times T = 240
   \]

3. **Solve for \( T \):**
   \[
   T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 576
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   Since 40% are boys, the remaining 56% are girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 0.56 \times 576 = 322.56
   \]
   However, since the number of students must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 323
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{323}
\]
