Q: Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Let:**
- \( R \) = number of red chickens
- \( W \) = number of white chickens

**Given:**
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs/day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs/day.
3. Total eggs collected daily = 42.
4. Number of white chickens = Number of red chickens + 2.

**Equations:**
1. \( 3R + 5W = 42 \) (Total eggs)
2. \( W = R + 2 \) (Two more white chickens than red chickens)

**Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:**
\[
3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
\]
\[
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R + 10 = 42
\]
\[
8R = 42 - 10
\]
\[
8R = 32
\]
\[
R = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

**Answer:**
Jerry has \(\boxed{4}\) red chickens.
