Q: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. **Seth gives half of his stickers to Luis:**
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of stickers Seth had initially.
   - He gives \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers to Luis.

2. **Luis uses half of the stickers and gives the rest to Kris:**
   - Luis receives \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers from Seth.
   - He uses half of these stickers, so he uses \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
   - The remaining \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers are given to Kris.

3. **Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 stickers to Rob:**
   - Kris keeps 9 stickers.
   - He gives 7 stickers to Rob.

Now, let's analyze the total number of stickers each person has:

- **Seth:**
  - Gave \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers to Luis.
  - Kept \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
  - **Total:** \( \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = S \) stickers.

- **Luis:**
  - Received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers from Seth.
  - Used \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
  - Kept \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
  - **Total:** \( \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{4} = \frac{3S}{4} \) stickers.

- **Kris:**
  - Kept 9 stickers.
  - Gave 7 stickers to Rob.
  - **Total:** \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.

- **Rob:**
  - Received 7 stickers from Kris.
  - **Total:** 7 stickers.

Now, let's consider the total number of stickers in the system:

- **Total stickers:** \( S \) (Seth) + \( \frac{3S}{4} \) (Luis) + 16 (Kris) + 7 (Rob) = \( S + \frac{3S}{4} + 23 = \frac{7S}{4} + 23 \).

However, since all the stickers are accounted for, the total should equal the initial number of stickers \( S \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{7S}{4} + 23 = S
\]

Solving for \( S \):

\[
\frac{7S}{4} - S = -23
\]
\[
\frac{3S}{4} = -23
\]
\[
3S = -84
\]
\[
S = -28
\]

Wait, this doesn't make sense because the number of stickers cannot be negative. It seems there might be a mistake in the setup. Let's re-examine the problem.

Upon re-reading, it appears that the problem might be misinterpreted. Let's try a different approach by working backward from the final amounts.

1. **Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob:**
   - Total given to Rob: 7 stickers.
   - Total given to Kris: 9 stickers.
   - **Total given away:** \( 7 + 9 = 16 \) stickers.

2. **Luis kept \( \frac{S}{4} \) and gave \( \frac{S}{4} \) to Kris:**
   - The \( \frac{S}{4} \) given to Kris is part of the 16 stickers.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 7 \) (since Kris gave 7 to Rob and kept 9).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     \frac{S}{4} = 7
     \]
     \[
     S = 7 \times 4 = 28
     \]

3. **Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis:**
   - If \( S = 28 \), then \( \frac{S}{2} = 14 \) stickers.
   - Luis received 14 stickers from Seth.
   - Luis used half of these, which is 7 stickers, and gave the remaining 7 to Kris.

4. **Luis kept \( \frac{S}{4} = 7 \) stickers and gave 7 to Kris:**
   - This matches the problem statement.

5. **Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob:**
   - Total given to Rob: 7 stickers.
   - Total given to Kris:
