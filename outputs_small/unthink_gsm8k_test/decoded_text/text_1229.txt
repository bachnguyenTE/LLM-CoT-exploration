**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   - The toy was priced at \$40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   - The price increased by **80%**.
   - To find the increase: \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \)
   - New price after increase: \( 44 + 32 = 76 \) (Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let's correct it.)

   **Correct Calculation:**
   - **80% of 44** is \( 44 \times 0.80 = 35.20 \)
   - **New price in December:** \( 44 + 35.20 = 79.20 \)

3. **Price Decrease in January:**
   - The price decreased by **50%**.
   - **50% of 79.20** is \( 79.20 \times 0.55 = 43.56 \)
   - **New price after decrease:** \( 79.20 - 43.56 = 35.64 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{35.64}
