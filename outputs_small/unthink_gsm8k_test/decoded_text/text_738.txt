Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
3. Clara has 20 books.

**Step 1: Determine how many books Steven has.**

Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.

\[
\text{Clara's books} = 2 \times S
\]

Given that Clara has 20 books:

\[
20 = 2 \times S
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( S \).**

\[
S = \frac{22}{2} = 11
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many books Alice has.**

Alice has 6 more books than Steven.

\[
\text{Alice's books} = S + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17
\]

**Step 4: Find how many more books Clara has than Alice.**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 22 - 17 = 5
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
