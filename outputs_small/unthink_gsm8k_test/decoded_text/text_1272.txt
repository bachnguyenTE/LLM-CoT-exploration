Q: Helen went on a trip through Germany. She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for **3 nights**.
   - The cost per night at the hotel is **\$80**.
   - **Total cost for the hotel** = Number of nights × Cost per night
     \[
     3 \text{ nights} \times \$80/\text{night} = \$240
     \]

2. **Bus Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus **7 times**.
   - Each bus trip costs **10%** of the hotel cost per night.
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8.80
     \]
   - **Total cost for bus trips** = Number of trips × Cost per trip
     \[
     7 \text{ trips} \times \$8.80/\text{trip} = \$61.60
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - **Total amount Helen paid** = Total hotel cost + Total bus cost
     \[
     \$240 + \$61.60 = \$301.60
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$301.60}
\]
