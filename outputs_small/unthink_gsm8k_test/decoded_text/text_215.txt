**Solution:**

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that costs **\$320.00** and a matching belt that costs **\$32.00**. 

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   \[
   \$320.0 + \$32.00 = \$354.00
   \]

2. **Determine how much Lori earns per hour:**
   \[
   \$8.00 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the purchase:**
   \[
   \frac{\$354.00}{\$8.00 \text{ per hour}} = 44.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

Since Lori can't work a fraction of an hour, she needs to work **45 hours** to have enough money to make the purchase.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
