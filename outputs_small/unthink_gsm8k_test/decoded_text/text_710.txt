To determine Marcus' total bill with the 10% discount, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of each item:**
   - **Croissants:** \(5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
   - **Cinnamon Rolls:** \(4 \text{ rolls} \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
   - **Mini Quiches:** \(3 \text{ quiches} \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
   - **Blueberry Muffins:** \(13 \text{ muffins} \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

2. **Sum up all the costs:**
   \[
   \$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$40.20
   \]

3. **Apply the 10% loyalty discount:**
   \[
   \$40.20 \times 0.10 = \$4.02
   \]
   \[
   \$40.20 - \$4.20 = \$39.98
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$39.98}
\]
