Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Tim has **7 blue shoe boxes** and **9 red shoe boxes**.
- He uses **3 blue shoeboxes** and **1/3 of his red shoeboxes** to go fishing.

**Step 1: Determine the number of red shoeboxes used.**
- Tim uses **1/3** of his **9 red shoeboxes**.
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \) red shoeboxes.

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes.**
- Total red shoeboxes: 9
- Used red shoeboxes: 3
- Remaining red shoeboxes: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes.**
- Tim uses **3 blue shoeboxes**.
- Total blue shoeboxes: 7
- Remaining blue shoeboxes: \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)

**Final Answer:**
- **Remaining blue shoeboxes:** 4
- **Remaining red shoeboxes:** 6

\boxed{4 \text{ blue shoeboxes and } 6 \text{ red shoeboxes}}
