**Solution:**

To determine how much James saved by picking blueberries himself instead of buying at the store, we'll compare the total costs of both options.

1. **Cost of Picking Blueberries:**
   - **Go Picking Cost:** \$20
   - **Cost per Pound:** \$1.5
   - **Pounds Picked:** 30 pounds

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$20 + (30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5/\text{pound}) = \$20 + \$45 = \$65
   \]

2. **Cost of Buying at the Store:**
   - **Price per Pound:** \$2.5
   - **Pounds Purchased:** 30 pounds

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5/\text{pound} = \$75
   \]

3. **Savings:**
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost at Store} - \text{Cost of Picking} = \$75 - \$65 = \$10
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$10}
\]
