**Solution:**

To determine how much William spent in total, we'll calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

1. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Each notebook costs \$1.50.
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 × \$1.50 = \$7.50.

2. **Cost of Ballpen:**
   - Each ballpen costs \$0.50.
   - William bought 1 ballpen.
   - Total cost for ballpen = 1 × \$0.50 = \$0.50.

3. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Add the cost of notebooks and the ballpen.
   - Total = \$7.50 + \$0.50 = \$8.00.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$8.00}
