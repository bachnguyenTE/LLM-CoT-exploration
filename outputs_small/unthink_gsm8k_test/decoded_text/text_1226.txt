Q: A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Nail Manicure:**
   - **Cost of a basic manicure:** \$35

2. **Pedicure:**
   - **Cost of a pedicure:** \$40
   - **Discount for both:** 20% off
   - **Discount amount:** 20% of \$40 = 0.20 × 40 = \$8.80
   - **Cost after discount:** \$40 - \$8.80 = \$31.20

3. **Nail Art:**
   - **Cost per nail:** \$3
   - **Number of nails:** 1 (assuming one nail per finger)
   - **Total cost for nail art:** 1 × \$3 = \$3

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Total = manicure + pedicure + nail art**
   - **Total = \$35 + \$31.20 + \$3 = \$69.20**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$69.20}
