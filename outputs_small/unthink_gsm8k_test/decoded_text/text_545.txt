**Solution:**

1. **Distance to Jeff's Work:**
   - Jeff walks **3 miles** to work.

2. **Distance for a Round Trip:**
   - He walks **3 miles** to work and **3 miles** back home.
   - **Total distance per day** = \(3 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance for 5 Days:**
   - He works **5 times a week**.
   - **Total distance** = \(6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{30 \text{ miles}}
\]
