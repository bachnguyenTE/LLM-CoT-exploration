Q: A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Bridge Capacity:** 5000 pounds
   - **Driver and Empty Truck Weight:** 3755 pounds
   - **Weight of Each Box:** 15 pounds

2. **Calculate the Remaining Weight Capacity for the Boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Weight} = \text{Bridge Capacity} - \text{Driver and Truck Weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining Weight} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Number of Boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining Weight}}{\text{Weight per Box}} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{83}
   \]
