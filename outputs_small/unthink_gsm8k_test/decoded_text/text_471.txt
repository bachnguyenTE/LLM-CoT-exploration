Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

1. **Total Number of Students and Initial Pencils:**
   - There are **30 students** in Marissa’s class.
   - Each student started with **10 pencils**.
   - **Total initial pencils in the class:** \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils} \).

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - **1/5 of the total pencils** were used.
   - **Pencils used:** \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils} \).

3. **Remaining Pencils After Two Months:**
   - **Total pencils after two months:** \( 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils} \).

4. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - **1/3 of the remaining pencils** were left.
   - **Pencils left:** \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils} \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{80}\)
