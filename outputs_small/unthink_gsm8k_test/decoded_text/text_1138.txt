**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Animals:**
   - **Cows:** 50
   - **Chickens:** 20
   - **Total Initial Animals:** \(50 + 20 = 72\)

2. **Daily Addition of Animals:**
   - **Cows:** 20 per day
   - **Chickens:** 10 per day
   - **Total Daily Addition:** \(20 + 10 = 30\) animals per day

3. **Duration:**
   - **Three Weeks:** \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days

4. **Total Addition Over Three Weeks:**
   - **Cows Added:** \(20 \times 21 = 420\) cows
   - **Chickens Added:** \(10 \times 21 = 210\) chickens
   - **Total Added Animals:** \(420 + 210 = 630\) animals

5. **Total Number of Animals After Three Weeks:**
   - **Initial Animals:** 72
   - **Added Animals:** 630
   - **Total Animals:** \(72 + 630 = 702\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{702}
