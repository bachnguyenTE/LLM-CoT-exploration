To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, follow these steps:

1. **Total Number of Teeth:**
   James has **30 teeth**.

2. **Number of Teeth Drilled:**
   The dentist drills **4 teeth**.

3. **Number of Teeth Capped:**
   The dentist caps **7 more teeth than he drills**. 
   \[
   \text{Capped Teeth} = 4 \text{ (drilled)} + 7 = 11 \text{ teeth}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Teeth Fixed:**
   \[
   \text{Total Fixed} = 4 \text{ (drilled)} + 11 \text{ (capped)} = 15 \text{ teeth}
   \]

5. **Percentage of Teeth Fixed:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100\% \approx 16.67\%
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16.67\%}
\]
