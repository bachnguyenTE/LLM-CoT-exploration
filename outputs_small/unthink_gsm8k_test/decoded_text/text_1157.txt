**Solution:**

Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Isabel's Height:**
   - Isabel is **7 feet tall**.

2. **Ned's Height:**
   - Ned is **2 feet shorter** than Isabel.
   - **Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet**
   - **Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet**

3. **Carl's Height:**
   - Carl is **1 foot taller** than his brother, Ned.
   - **Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot**
   - **Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet**

4. **Length of Carl's Cane:**
   - Carl's cane is **half as long** as he is tall.
   - **Cane length = (1/2) * Carl's height**
   - **Cane length = (1/2) * 6 feet = 3 feet**

**Final Answer:**
Carl's cane is **3 feet long**.

\boxed{3}
