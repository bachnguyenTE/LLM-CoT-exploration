To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, follow these steps:

1. **List the number of birds Mack saw each day:**
   - Day 1: 50 birds
   - Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4: 120 birds
   - Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

2. **Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:**
   \[
   55 + 55 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 462 \text{ birds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days in the week:**
   \[
   7 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Compute the average number of birds per day:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of birds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{462}{7} = 66 \text{ birds per day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{66}
\]
