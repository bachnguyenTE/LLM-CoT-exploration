Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Valerie earns \$5,000 per month.
- Valerie earns half of what her brother earns.
- Their mother earns twice their combined salary.

**Step 1: Determine Valerie's Brother's Earnings**

Valerie earns half of her brother's salary. Let's denote her brother's earnings as \( B \).

\[
\text{Valerie's Earnings} = \frac{1}{2} \times B
\]

Given that Valerie earns \$5,000 per month:

\[
5,000 = \frac{1}{2} \times B
\]

To find \( B \), multiply both sides by 2:

\[
B = 5,000 \times 2 = 10,000
\]

So, her brother earns \$10,000 per month.

**Step 2: Calculate the Combined Salary of Valerie and Her Brother**

\[
\text{Combined Salary} = \text{Valerie's Earnings} + \text{Brother's Earnings} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000
\]

**Step 3: Determine the Mother's Earnings**

The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.

\[
\text{Mother's Earnings} = 2 \times 15,000 = 30,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Total Earnings of All Three**

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Valerie's Earnings} + \text{Brother's Earnings} + \text{Mother's Earnings} = 5,000 + 10,000 + 30,000 = 45,000
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{45,\!000}
\]
