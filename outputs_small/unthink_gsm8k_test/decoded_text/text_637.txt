Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many miles Lynn ran.

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

2. **Given:**
   - Paisley ran **4 miles**.

3. **Express Reggie's Distance in Terms of Paisley:**
   - Reggie ran \( 5 \times \) (Paisley's distance) = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

4. **Express Reggie's Distance in Terms of Lynn:**
   - Reggie ran **3 miles farther** than Lynn.
   - Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran.
   - Therefore, Reggie's distance = \( L + 3 \).

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - From step 3, Reggie ran 22 miles.
   - So, \( L + 3 = 22 \).

6. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( L = 22 - 3 \).
   - \( L = 19 \).

**Final Answer:** Lynn ran \(\boxed{19}\) miles.
