**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of attendees:**
   - Christina invited **16 friends**.
   - **1/4** of the attendees don't show up, so:
     \[
     \text{Number of attendees} = 16 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 16\right) = 16 - 4 = 12
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of gift bags needed:**
   - Christina needs **0.75** gift bags per invited guest.
   - Total gift bags needed:
     \[
     12 \times 0.75 = 9
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for gift bags:**
   - Each gift bag costs **\$2**.
   - Total cost:
     \[
     9 \times \$2 = \$18
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$18}
\]
