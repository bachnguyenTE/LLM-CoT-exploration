Q: David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?

To determine how much money David saves by choosing to buy a ride bracelet instead of purchasing tickets for all 9 rides, let's break down the costs step by step.

**David's Options:**
1. **Buy a ride bracelet:**
   - **Cost:** \$30
   - **Rides Included:** 9 rides

2. **Buy tickets:**
   - **Cost per ride ticket:** \$2
   - **Total rides needed:** 9
   - **Total cost for tickets:** \( 9 \text{ rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$18 \)

**Dasha's Options:**
- **Cost:** \$18 (for 9 ride tickets)

**Comparison:**
- **David's Total Cost:** \$30 (bracelet)
- **Dasha's Total Cost:** \$18 (tickets)

**Savings:**
- **Savings:** \( \$30 - \$18 = \$12 \)

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{12}
