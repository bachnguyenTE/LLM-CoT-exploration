**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the average car's speed.
   - Let \( B \) be the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
   - Let \( F \) be the speed of the faster car.

2. **Given information:**
   - The average car can go **120 miles per hour**.
   - The 2nd fastest car is **5 times faster** than the average car.
   - The faster car is **1.25 times faster** than the 2nd fastest car.

3. **Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car (\( B \)):**
   \[
   B = 5 \times A = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the speed of the faster car (\( F \)):**
   \[
   F = 1.25 \times B = 1.25 \times 660 = 825 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{825}
\]
