Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people accept the position.

1. **Total number of applicants:** 100 people.

2. **Interviews:**
   - **Interviews received:** 30% of 100.
   \[
   0.30 \times 100 = 30 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Job offers:**
   - **Job offers received:** 20% of the interviewees.
   \[
   0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Job offers accepted:**
   - **Acceptances:** A third of those who received a job offer.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ people}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{2}\) people accept the position.
