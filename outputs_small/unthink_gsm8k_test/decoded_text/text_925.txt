Q: There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the initial amount of water in the tank:**
   
   - The pool has **10,000 gallons** of water.
   - Anthony and his father fill a tank with **half the amount** of water in the pool.
   
   \[
   \text{Water in tank} = \frac{10,\!00}{2} = 5,\!00 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total water removed over 6 days:**
   
   - The **tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total water removed in 6 days} = 5,\!00 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 30,\!00 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Find the remaining water in the tank:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 5,\!00 \text{ gallons} - 30,\!00 \text{ gallons} = 20,\!00 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20,\!00}
\]
