**Solution:**

Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. Here's the breakdown:

1. **2 friends want 5 gifts each:**
   \[
   2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts} = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

2. **3 friends want 2 gifts each:**
   \[
   3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts} = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. **Total gifts initially bought:**
   \[
   10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. **Cherrie buys an additional 10 gifts:**
   \[
   16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
