**Solution:**

Let's break down Tim's monthly salary and calculate his annual earnings step by step.

1. **Base Salary:**
   - **Monthly Base Salary:** \$20,000
   - **Annual Base Salary:** 
     \[
     \$20,000 \times 12 = \$240,000
     \]

2. **Raise:**
   - **Raise Percentage:** 5%
   - **Monthly Raise:** 
     \[
     5\% \times \$20,000 = 0.05 \times \$20,000 = \$1,000
     \]
   - **New Monthly Base Salary After Raise:** 
     \[
     \$20,000 + \$1,000 = \$23,000
     \]

3. **Bonus:**
   - **Bonus Amount:** Half a month's salary
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times \$20,000 = \$10,000
     \]

4. **Total Monthly Earnings:**
   \[
   \$23,000 + \$10,000 = \$33,000
   \]

5. **Annual Earnings:**
   \[
   \$33,000 \times 12 = \$396,000
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$396,\!000}
\]
