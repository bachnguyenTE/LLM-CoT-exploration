Q: Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's break down Frankie's TV watching schedule step by step to determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

1. **Monday:**
   - Frankie watched a 1-hour episode.
   - **Total TV time on Monday:** 1 hour.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Frankie watched another 1-hour episode.
   - **Total TV time on Tuesday:** 1 hour.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Frankie watched a few 30-minute shows.
   - Let the number of 30-minute episodes be \( x \).
   - **Total TV time on Wednesday:** \( 30x \) minutes.

4. **Thursday:**
   - Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - **Total TV time on Thursday:** 1 hour + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

5. **Friday:**
   - Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - **Total TV time on Friday:** 2 hours.

6. **Total TV Time:**
   - Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV.

Now, let's convert all times to minutes for easier calculation:

- **Monday:** 60 minutes
- **Tuesday:** 60 minutes
- **Wednesday:** \( 30x \) minutes
- **Thursday:** 90 minutes
- **Friday:** 120 minutes

**Total TV time in minutes:**
\[
60 + 60 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Setting up the equation:**
\[
60 + 60 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 420
\]

**Simplifying:**
\[
60 + 60 = 120 \\
120 + 90 = 210 \\
210 + 120 = 330 \\
330 + 30x = 420 \\
30x = 420 - 330 \\
30x = 90 \\
x = \frac{90}{30} = 3
\]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
