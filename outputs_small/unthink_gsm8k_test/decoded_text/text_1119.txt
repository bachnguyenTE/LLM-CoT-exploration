1. **Amalia's chores:**
   - **Mowing the lawn:** Takes **4 hours**.

2. **Megan's chores:**
   - **Walking the dog:** Takes **2 hours longer** than Amalia.
   - **Calculation:** \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's chores:**
   - **Doing laundry:** Takes **over 4 hours longer** than Amalia.
   - **Calculation:** \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

   - **Megan:** 6 hours
   - **Dior:** 8 hours
   - **Total:** \(4 + 6 + 8 = 18 \text{ hours}\)
