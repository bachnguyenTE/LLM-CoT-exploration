Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week.

1. **Monday:**
   - **Sleep hours:** 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   - Each day, Sadie slept **2 hours less** than the previous day.
   - **Tuesday:** \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
   - **Wednesday:** \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

3. **Thursday to Sunday:**
   - For the rest of the week (which is **5 days**), Sadie slept **1 hour more** than the previous two days.
   - **Each day:** \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.

4. **Total Sleep Hours:**
   - **Monday:** 8 hours.
   - **Tuesday and Wednesday:** \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours.
   - **Thursday to Sunday:** \(5 \times 5 = 25\) hours.
   - **Total:** \(8 + 10 + 25 = 43\) hours.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{43}\)
