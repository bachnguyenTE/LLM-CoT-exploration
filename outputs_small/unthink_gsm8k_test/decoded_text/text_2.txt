**Solution:**

To determine Josh's profit from buying and flipping his house, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   - **Cost of the house:** \$80,000
   - **Repairs:** \$50,000

   **Total Initial Investment:** 
   \[
   \$80,000 + \$55,000 = \$135,000
   \]

2. **Value Increase:**
   - The value of the house increased by **150%**.

   **Calculating the Increase:**
   \[
   150\% \text{ of } \$135,000 = 0.15 \times \$135,000 = \$20,250
   \]

3. **Final Value of the House:**
   \[
   \text{Initial Investment} + \text{Increase} = \$135,000 + \$20,250 = \$155,250
   \]

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Investment} = \$155,250 - \$135,000 = \$20,250
   \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$20,250}
\]
