Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Farm has 30 cows.
- Zoo has 20 sheep.
- Zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
- Farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

**Step 1: Determine the number of cows in the Zoo.**

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. The farm has 30 cows.

\[
\text{Cows in Zoo} = 2 \times \text{Cows in Farm} = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of sheep in the Farm.**

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. The zoo has 20 sheep.

\[
\text{Sheep in Farm} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sheep in Zoo} = \frac{1}{2} \times 22 = 11
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals in the Farm.**

\[
\text{Total Animals in Farm} = \text{Cows in Farm} + \text{Sheep in Farm} = 30 + 11 = 44
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of animals in the Zoo.**

\[
\text{Total Animals in Zoo} = \text{Cows in Zoo} + \text{Sheep in Zoo} = 60 + 22 = 82
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the combined total of animals in both the Farm and Zoo.**

\[
\text{Combined Total} = \text{Total Animals in Farm} + \text{Total Animals in Zoo} = 44 + 82 = 126
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{126}
\]
