**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of bags sold:**
   
   Each bag contains 10 apples.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples sold}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   
   The price per bag is \$5.
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
