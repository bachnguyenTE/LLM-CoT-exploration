Q: Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - **Joey's Weight Loss:**
     - **Total Weight Loss:** 8 pounds
     - **Time Taken:** 4 weeks
   - **Sandy's Weight Loss:**
     - **Desired Total Weight Loss:** Same as Joey's, which is **8 pounds**
     - **Time Taken:** Let this be **\( x \) weeks**

2. **Calculate Sandy's Weight Loss per Week:**
   - **Joey's Rate:** 
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Weight Loss}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
     \]
   - **Sandy's Rate:**
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8}{x} \text{ pounds per week}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since both Sandy and Joey lose the same total weight, their rates should be equal:
     \[
     \frac{8}{x} = 2
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{8}{x} = 2 \\
   \Rightarrow x = \frac{8}{2} \\
   \Rightarrow x = 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take **4 weeks** for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in a single week.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
