Q: Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - **Red Hats:** \$400
   - **Green Hats:** Let’s denote the total sales from green hats as \( G \).
   - According to the problem, the sales from red hats were half of the sales from green hats.
     \[
     400 = \frac{1}{2}G \quad \Rightarrow \quad G = 800
     \]
   - **Total Sales for the First Month:**
     \[
     400 + 800 = 1200
     \]

2. **Second Month:**
   - It is given that the sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
     \[
     \text{Second Month Sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 915
     \]

3. **Total Sales Over Two Months:**
   \[
   1200 + 915 = 2115
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2115}
\]
