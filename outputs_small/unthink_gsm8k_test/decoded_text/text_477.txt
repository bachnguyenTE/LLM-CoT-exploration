To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Total number of kids in the class:** 32

2. **Number of kids allergic to dairy:** 9

3. **Number of kids allergic to peanuts:** 6

4. **Number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts:** 3

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

\[
\text{Total allergic} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both}
\]

\[
\text{Total allergic} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

5. **Number of kids not allergic to anything:** 

\[
\text{Total} - \text{Total allergic} = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{20}\)
