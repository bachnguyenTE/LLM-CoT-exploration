**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Number of adults: 42
   - Number of babies: 15
   - Total attendees: \(42 + 15 = 57\)
   - Number of high chairs: 8
   - The restaurant has **5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs**.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of chairs needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total chairs needed} = \text{Number of adults} + \text{Number of babies} = 42 + 15 = 57
   \]

4. **Find out how many more chairs are needed:**
   \[
   \text{Chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total chairs available} = 57 - 40 = 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
