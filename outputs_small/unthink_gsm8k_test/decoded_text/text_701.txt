**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of People:**
   - Aiden and 12 friends = 13 people
   - They meet with 7 more friends = 13 + 7 = **20 people**

2. **Seats Available:**
   - Each person gets one seat.
   - Total seats = 20

3. **Snacks and Drinks per Seat:**
   - Each seat has enough room for:
     - 1 person
     - 2 drinks
     - 3 snacks

4. **Total Snacks and Drinks:**
   - **Drinks:** 2 drinks per seat
     - Total drinks = 2 drinks/seat × 20 seats = **40 drinks**
   - **Snacks:** 3 snacks per seat
     - Total snacks = 3 snacks/seat × 20 seats = **60 snacks**

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Each drink and snack costs **\$2**.
   - **Total cost for drinks:** 40 drinks × \$2 = **\$80**
   - **Total cost for snacks:** 60 snacks × \$2 = **\$120**
   - **Total expenditure:** \$80 + \$120 = **\$208**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{208}
