To determine the total population of South America, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Number of Countries:** There are **26 countries** in South America.

2. **Cities per Country:** Each country has **5 cities**.

3. **Population per City:** Each city has **1,000 people**.

Now, let's calculate the total population:

\[
\text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Cities per Country} \times \text{Population per City}
\]

\[
\text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1,000 = 130,000
\]

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{130000}
