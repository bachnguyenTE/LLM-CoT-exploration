**Solution:**

James buys a ring for his bride-to-be, which includes a diamond costing \$600 and a gold costing \$300. Additionally, he pays a 30% premium for the ring. To find the total amount James paid, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the diamond and gold:**
   \[
   \$600 \, \text{Diamond} + \$300, \text{Gold} = \$990
   \]

2. **Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost:**
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } \$990 = 0.30 \times \$990 = \$327
   \]

3. **Add the premium to the total cost to find the final amount paid:**
   \[
   \$990 + \$327 = \$1,317
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1,\!317}
\]
