Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total white shirts: 40
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

**Find:**
How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars.

**Solution:**

1. **White Shirts:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - White shirts with collars: 20
   - White shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Floral Shirts:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Difference:**
   - Floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - White shirts without collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 33 - 20 = 13 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
