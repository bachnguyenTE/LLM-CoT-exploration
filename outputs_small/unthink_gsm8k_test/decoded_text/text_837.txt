Q: Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Erika has in her purse.

1. **Total Cost of the Laptop:**
   \[
   \$600
   \]

2. **Reduction in Price:**
   \[
   \$200 \text{ (discount from the new laptop)}
   \]

3. **Erika's Savings:**
   - She already has some savings in her purse.
   - She's been paid \$150 for her part-time job.
   - Her mom is giving her an additional \$80.

4. **Total Amount Erika has from her job and her mom:**
   \[
   \$150 + \$80 = \$235
   \]

5. **Erika's Current Savings:**
   - Let's denote her current savings as \( S \).

6. **Total Amount Erika has after receiving her part-time job money and her mom's gift:**
   \[
   S + \$235
   \]

7. **After the discount, Erika only needs an extra \$50 to buy the laptop.** This means:
   \[
   S + \$235 = \$600 - \$200
   \]
   \[
   S + \$235 = \$400
   \]

8. **Solving for \( S \):**
   \[
   S = \$400 - \$235 = \$165
   \]

9. **Therefore, Erika has \$165 in her purse.**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{165}
\]
