Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much each friend paid.

1. **Total Spent on Tickets:**
   - **Number of friends:** 3
   - **Total cost for tickets:** \$20.25

2. **Spending on Food:**
   - **Spent on food:** \$4.50 less than on the tickets.
   - **Total spent on food:** \$20.25 - \$4.50 = **\$15.75**

3. **Spending on Rides:**
   - **Each ride costs:** \$33
   - **Number of rides:** 2
   - **Total spent on rides:** 2 × \$33 = **\$66**

4. **Total Costs:**
   - **Total spent by all friends:** 
     - Tickets: \$20.25
     - Food: \$15.75
     - Rides: \$66.00
     - **Total:** \$20.25 + \$15.75 + \$66.00 = **\$102.00**

5. **Cost per Friend:**
   - **Total cost divided by 3 friends:** 
     - \$102.00 ÷ 3 = **\$34.00**

**Final Answer:**  
Each friend paid **\$34.00**.
