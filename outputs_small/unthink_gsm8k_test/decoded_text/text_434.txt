Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Chips:** \$0.40 (40 cents)
- **Candy Bars:** \$0.75 (75 cents)
- **Total Money Spent:** \$5.00
- **Number of Chips Bought:** 3 bags
- **Money Left After Buying:** 1% of the total money

**Let’s denote:**
- \( x \) = number of candy bars bought

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on chips.**
\[
\text{Cost of chips} = 3 \times \$0.40 = \$1.20
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total money George had initially.**
\[
\text{Total money} = \$5.00
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on candy bars.**
\[
\text{Total money} - \text{Cost of chips} - \text{Cost of candy bars} = \text{Money left}
\]
\[
\$5.00 - \$1.20 - \$0.75x = 0.01 \times \$5.00
\]

**Step 4: Simplify the equation.**
\[
\$5.00 - \$1.20 = \$3.80
\]
\[
\$3.80 - \$0.75x = \$0.055
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( x \).**
\[
\$3.80 - \$0.055 = \$0.75x
\]
\[
\$3.745 = \$0.75x
\]
\[
x = \frac{\$3.745}{\$0.75} \approx 4.993
\]

Since George can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
