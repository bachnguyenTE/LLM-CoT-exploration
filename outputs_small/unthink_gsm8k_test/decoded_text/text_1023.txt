To determine the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we'll calculate the daily consumption for each member and then multiply by 7 days.

1. **Man's Consumption:**
   - **Per day:** 5 sandwiches
   - **Per week:** \(5 \times 7 = 35\) sandwiches

2. **Wife's Consumption:**
   - **Per day:** 4 sandwiches
   - **Per week:** \(4 \times 7 = 28\) sandwiches

3. **Son's Consumption:**
   - **Per day:** 2 sandwiches
   - **Per week:** \(2 \times 7 = 14\) sandwiches

4. **Total Weekly Consumption:**
   - **Man + Wife + Son:** \(35 + 28 + 14 = 77\) sandwiches

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{77}\)
