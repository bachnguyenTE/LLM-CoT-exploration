Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of participants in the race: 240
- Number of Asians: 240
  - Number of Japanese participants: 80
  - Number of Chinese participants: \( 240 - 80 = 160 \)
- Number of boys on the Chinese team: 60

**Question:**
How many girls were on the Chinese team?

**Solution:**

1. **Total number of participants on the Chinese team:**
   \[
   \text{Total Chinese participants} = 160
   \]

2. **Number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total Chinese participants} - \text{Number of boys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100
   \]

**Answer:**
\[
\boxed{100}
