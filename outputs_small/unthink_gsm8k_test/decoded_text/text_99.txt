Q: Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of 40 window ledges, so the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[
2 \text{ potted plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ potted plants}
\]

She receives 18 new potted plants from the nursery:

\[
80 \text{ potted plants} + 18 \text{ potted plants} = 98 \text{ potted plants}
\]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges to her friends and family:

\[
98 \text{ potted plants} - 40 \text{ potted plants} = 54 \text{ potted plants}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{54}
\]
