**Solution:**

Hannah needs to drink **60 ml** of water for each **1 km** she runs. Her gym teacher tells her to run **8 laps**, and each lap is **0.25 km**.

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Number of Laps} \times \text{Distance per Lap} = 8 \times 0.25 \, \text{km} = 2 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total Water} = \text{Water per km} \times \text{Total Distance} = 60 \,0000 \,000 \,000 \,000 \, \text{ml} \times 2 \,0 \, \text{km} = 120 \,000 \, \text{ml}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120 \, \text{ml}}\) of water.
