A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day. To find out how many packs he needs for 30 days, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of gum pieces Parker will chew in 30 days:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 120 \, \text{pieces}
   \]

2. **Determine how many packs are needed:**
   
   Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. So, divide the total pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120 \, \text{pieces}}{15 \, \text{pieces/pack}} = 8.666...
   \]

3. **Since Parker can't buy a fraction of a pack, round up to the next whole number:**
   
   \[
   \text{Packs needed} = 9
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Parker will need \(\boxed{9}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days.
