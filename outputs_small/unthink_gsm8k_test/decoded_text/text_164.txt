To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Doing Taxes Yourself:**
   - **Taxes:** \$35/hour
   - **Freelance Work:** 3 fewer hours

2. **Cost of Hiring an Accountant:**
   - **Accountant:** \$90/hour

3. **Calculate the Savings from Doing Taxes Yourself:**
   - **Lost Freelance Income:** 3 hours * \$35/hour = \$105

4. **Determine the Net Savings:**
   - **Net Savings:** \$105 (since she saves money by not doing taxes herself)

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - **Total Savings:** \$105

Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have **\$105 more** than if she does her taxes herself.
