Q: Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?

To determine how far off Tim's guess was, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   \[
   \text{Volume of jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6\, \text{in} \times 6\, \text{in} \times 15\, \text{in} = 540\, \text{cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of jelly beans:**
   \[
   \text{Total jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of jar}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{540}{0.15} = 3600\, \text{jelly beans}
   \]

3. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   \[
   \text{Red jelly beans} = 3600 \times 0.30 = 1080\, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference between the actual and estimated red jelly beans:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = |1080 - 900| = 180\, \text{red jelly beans}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{180}
\]
