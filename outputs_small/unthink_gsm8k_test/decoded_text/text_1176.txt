Q: A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

To determine how many days the teacher can use chalk before needing to recycle the 5-inch piece, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The teacher starts with a new piece of chalk, which is 5 inches long.
   - He uses **20% of the chalk each day** to conserve it.
   - However, since the students need extra help, he uses **45% of the chalk** by the end of the day.

2. **Understanding the Usage:**
   - **Total chalk used per day:** 45% of 5 inches.
   - **Recycling point:** Recycles when the chalk piece is **smaller than 2 inches**.

3. **Calculations:**
   - **Total chalk used per day:** 
     \[
     45\% \times 5\text{ inches} = 0.225\text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Number of days before recycling:**
     - The teacher can use chalk until it reaches the recycling point (2 inches).
     - Since he uses 0.225 inches per day, the number of days before recycling is:
     \[
     \frac{2\text{ inches}}{0.225\text{ inches/day}} \approx 8.888\text{ days}
     \]
   - Since the teacher can't use a fraction of a day, he can use chalk for **8 days** before needing to recycle.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
