**Solution:**

To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling his tunas, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the tunas:**
   \[
   56\ \text{kg} + 46\ \text{kg} + 26\ \text{kg} = 128\ \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per kilogram:**
   \[
   \$0.50\ \text{per kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   128\ \text{kg} \times \$0.50/\text{kg} = \$67.20
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$67.20}
\]
