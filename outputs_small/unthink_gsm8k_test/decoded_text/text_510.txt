To determine how much of a **calorie deficit** Andy needs each day to lose 3000 pounds by his birthday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the goal:**
   - **Goal:** Lose 3000 pounds.
   - **Calories burned per pound lost:** 3500 calories.

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total Calorie Deficit} = \text{Pounds to Lose} \times \text{Calories per Pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Calorie Deficit} = 3000 \times 3500 = 11,250,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days in the period:**
   - **Start Date:** December 31st
   - **End Date:** July 19th
   - **Total Days:** 183 days

4. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed:**
   \[
   \text{Daily Calorie Deficit} = \frac{\text{Total Calorie Deficit}}{\text{Total Days}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily Calorie Deficit} = \frac{11,250,000}{183} \approx 6,280 \text{ calories per day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Andy needs to create a **calorie deficit of approximately 6,280 calories per day** to reach his goal of losing 3000 pounds by his birthday.
