Let's determine the depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday step by step.

**Given:**
- **Monday:** 17 feet of water depth.

**Tuesday:**
- The depth of the water is **7 feet more** than on Monday.
  
  \[
  \text{Tuesday's depth} = \text{Monday's depth} + 7 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
  \]

**Wednesday:**
- The depth of the water is **two-thirds** of what it was on Tuesday.
  
  \[
  \text{Wednesday's depth} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Tuesday's depth} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
  \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ feet}}
\]
