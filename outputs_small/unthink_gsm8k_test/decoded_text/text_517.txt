**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Suzanne made **36 cookies**.
   - Josh made **one-fourth** the number of cookies that Suzanne made.
   - Kelsie made **two times** more cookies than Josh.

2. **Find:**
   - How many cookies did Kelsie make?

3. **Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Josh made.**

   Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made.
   
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Suzanne's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

4. **Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made.**

   Kelsie made two times more than Josh. This means Kelsie made **two times** the number of cookies Josh made.

   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times \text{Josh's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   
   \[
   \boxed{18}
   \]
