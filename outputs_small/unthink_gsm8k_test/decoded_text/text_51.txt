**Solution:**

To determine how long it takes Tom to return from his ship, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Tom's ship travels at **10 miles per hour**.
   - He sails from **1 PM** to **4 PM**, which is **3 hours**.
   - He then travels **back** at **6 miles per hour**.
   - We need to find the time it takes for him to return.

2. **Calculate the Distance:**
   
   Since Tom is traveling for **3 hours** at **10 mph**, the distance he covers is:
   
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \,0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
