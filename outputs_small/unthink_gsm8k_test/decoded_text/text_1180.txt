To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk sold:**
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Determine the portion of milk that expired:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   \[
   1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$23,800
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{23800}
\]
