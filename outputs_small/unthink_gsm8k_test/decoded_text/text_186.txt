Q: Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?

To determine how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Rats:**
   - **Total Rats:** 160 (given in the problem)
   - **Cages:** 3 equal groups
   - **Straw per Rat:** 6 pieces

   Let \( x \) be the number of rats in each cage.

   The total number of rats is:
   \[
   3x = 160
   \]
   
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{160}{3} \approx 53.33
   \]
   
   However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, this suggests there might be a mistake in the problem setup or the given numbers. If the total distributed is indeed 160 pieces, and each rat gets 6 pieces, then:
   \[
   3x = 160 \Rightarrow x = \frac{160}{3} \approx 53.33
   \]
   
   This result is not possible with whole rats per cage. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided numbers.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{53.33}
\]
