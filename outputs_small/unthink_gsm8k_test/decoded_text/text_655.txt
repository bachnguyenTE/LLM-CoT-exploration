A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

It seems like you're asking for the number of pages Shiela has left to write for her research paper. However, the information provided is insufficient to determine the exact number of pages remaining. Here's why:

1. **Total Pages Required**: Shiela is required to submit a **15-page research paper**.
2. **Pages Already Written**: She has already finished writing **1/3** of the paper.

To find out how many pages she has left, you can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Pages Remaining} = \text{Total Pages} - \text{Pages Written}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Pages Remaining} = 15 - \left(15 \times \frac{1}{3}\right) = 15 - 5 = 10
\]

**Answer**: Shiela has **10 pages** left to write.
