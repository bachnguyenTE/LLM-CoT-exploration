To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying flowers at the better price, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per package for each option.**

- **Option 1:**  
  - **Package size:** 3 flowers  
  - **Cost per package:** \$2.500  
  - **Number of packages needed for 18 flowers:**  
    \[
    \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{3 \text{ flowers/package}} = 6 \text{ packages}
    \]  
  - **Total cost:**  
    \[
    6 \text{ packages} \times \$2.500/\text{package} = \$15.30
    \]

- **Option 2:**  
  - **Package size:** 2 flowers  
  - **Cost per package:** \$1.00  
  - **Number of packages needed for 18 flowers:**  
    \[
    \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{2 \text{flowers/package}} = 9 \text{ packages}
    \]  
  - **Total cost:**  
    \[
    9 \text{ packages} \times \$1.00/\text{package} = \$9.00
    \]

**Step 2: Determine the savings by choosing the better price.**

- **Savings:**  
  \[
  \$15.30 - \$9.00 = \$6.30
  \]

**Final Answer:**  
Vincent saves \(\boxed{\$6.30}\) by buying 18 flowers at the better price.
