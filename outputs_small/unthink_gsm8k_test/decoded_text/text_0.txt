**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of eggs produced daily:**
   
   Janet's ducks lay **16 eggs per day**.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast:**
   
   - **Breakfast:** She eats **3 eggs** every morning.
   - **Total breakfast eggs per day:** \( 3 \) eggs.

3. **Calculate the number of eggs baked into muffins:**
   
   - **Muffins:** She uses **4 eggs** every day for baking.
   - **Total muffin eggs per day:** \( 4 \) eggs.

4. **Determine the total number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total eggs used} = 3 \, \text{Breakfast} + 4 \, \text{Muffins} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of eggs left for selling at the farmers' market:**
   
   \[
   \text{Eggs for selling} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Total eggs used} = 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. **Determine the revenue from selling the eggs:**
   
   - **Selling price per egg:** \( \$2 \)
   - **Total revenue per day:** \( 9 \text{ eggs} \times \$2 = \$18 \)

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
