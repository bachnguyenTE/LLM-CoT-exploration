Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people attended Martha's Christmas party.

1. **Martha's Invitations:**
   - She invited:
     - 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
     - 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times4 = 12\) people
   - **Total invitations:** \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

2. **People Who Couldn't Attend:**
   - **8 people couldn't come due to illness.**

3. **People with Previous Commitments:**
   - **1/4 of the 8 people with previous commitments:**
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
     \]

4. **Total People Who Couldn't Attend:**
   - **8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people**

5. **People Who Showed Up:**
   - **Total invitations - people who couldn't attend - people with previous commitments:**
     \[
     24 - 10 = 14 \text{ people}
     \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{14}\)
