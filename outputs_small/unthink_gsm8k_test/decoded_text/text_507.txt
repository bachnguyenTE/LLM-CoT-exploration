**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of two bus trips without the pass:**
   - Each bus trip costs \$2.20.
   - Janet takes **2** bus trips per week.
   - Total cost without the pass = \( 2 \times \$2.20 = \$4.40 \).

2. **Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass:**
   - The weekly bus pass costs \$20.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost without the pass - Cost with the pass
   - Savings = \$4.40 - \$20 = **\$1.60**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1.60}
\]
