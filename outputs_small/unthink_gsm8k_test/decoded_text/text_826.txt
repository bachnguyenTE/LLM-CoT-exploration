Q: On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy has in total.

1. **Green Eggs:**
   - Cindy has **5 green eggs**.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   - She has **twice as many blue eggs as green eggs**.
   - **Blue eggs = 2 × Green eggs = 2 × 5 = 10 blue eggs**.

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   - She has **one fewer pink egg than blue eggs**.
   - **Pink eggs = Blue eggs - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs**.

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   - She has **one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs**.
   - **Yellow eggs = (1/3) × Pink eggs = (1/3) × 9 = 3 yellow eggs**.

5. **Total Eggs:**
   - **Total = Green + Blue + Pink + Yellow**
   - **Total = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs**

**Final Answer:** Cindy has a total of \(\boxed{27}\) eggs.
