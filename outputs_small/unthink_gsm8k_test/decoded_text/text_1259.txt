A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Derrick's bakery produces **10 dozen doughnuts** every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts produced daily is:

\[
10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts per dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts}
\]

Doughnuts are sold at **\$2 per doughnut**. Therefore, the daily revenue from doughnuts is:

\[
120 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2 \text{ per doughnut} = \$240
\]

June has **30 days**. To find the total revenue for the month, multiply the daily revenue by the number of days:

\[
\$240 \text{ per day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$7,200
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$7,\!200}
\]
