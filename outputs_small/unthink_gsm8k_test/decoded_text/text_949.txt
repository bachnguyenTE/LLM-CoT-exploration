Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old Leo is.

**Given:**
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Deanna is 26 years old.

**Step 1: Determine Marcus's Age**
- Deanna is 26 years old.
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
- Therefore, Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
- **Marcus = 26 - 5 = 21 years old**

**Step 2: Relate Marcus's Age to Leo's Age**
- Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
- Let Leo's age be \( L \).
- Therefore, \( \text{Marcus} = \frac{1}{2}L \)
- We know Marcus is 22, so:
- \( 22 = \frac{1}{2}L \)

**Step 3: Solve for Leo's Age**
- Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
- \( L = 22 \times 2 = 44 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
