**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Marbles bought from Johanna:**
   - Solomon bought **20 marbles** from his friend Johanna.

2. **Marbles added to the store:**
   - The store initially had **50 marbles**.
   - Solomon added **20 marbles** to the store.
   - **Total marbles in the store after addition:** \(50 + 20 = 70\) marbles.

3. **Marbles given by Solomon's father:**
   - Solomon's father gave him **\( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna**.
   - Marbles bought by Solomon: \(20\)
   - Marbles given by father: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

4. **Total marbles in the store:**
   - Marbles in the store after addition: \(70\)
   - Marbles added by father: \(8\)
   - **Total marbles:** \(70 + 8 = 78\) marbles.

5. **Total weight of marbles:**
   - Each marble weighs **2 kg**.
   - **Total weight:** \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kg.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{156\,\text{kg}}
\]
