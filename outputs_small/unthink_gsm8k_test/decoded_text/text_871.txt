Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far.

**Total Pizza Pieces:**  
Tobias bought a big pizza with **60 pieces**.

**First Day:**
- **Eaten:** \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the pieces.
- Calculation:  
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{132}{5} = 26.4 \text{ pieces}
  \]
- **Remaining Pieces:**  
  \[
  66 - 26.4 = 39.6 \text{ pieces}
  \]

**Second Day:**
- **Eaten:** 10 pieces.
- **Remaining Pieces:**  
  \[
  39.6 - 10 = 28.6 \text{ pieces}
  \]

**Third Day:**
- **Remaining Pieces:** 28.6 pieces.
- **Eaten:** \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces.
- Calculation:  
  \[
  \frac{7}{13} \times 28.6 = \frac{200.2}{13} \approx 15.4 \text{ pieces}
  \]
- **Total Eaten So Far:**  
  \[
  26.4 + 10 + 15.4 = 51.8 \text{ pieces}
  \]

**Final Answer:**  
Tobias has eaten approximately **51.8 pieces** of pizza so far.

\[
\boxed{51.8}
\]
