To determine the total number of articles both companies publish in February, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of articles published by each company in February:**
   
   - **Newsier (Political and Weather):**  
     \[
     \text{Total articles} = \text{Average per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 20 \times 28 = 560
     \]
   
   - **Newsier2 (Business):**  
     \[
     \text{Total articles} = \text{Average per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 10 \times28 = 280
     \]

2. **Add the totals from both companies:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 560 + 280 = 848
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{848}
\]
