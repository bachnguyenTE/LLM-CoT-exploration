To determine the price of Ben's car in 2010, we'll use the formula for **compound depreciation**. The car's value decreases by 21% each year. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Initial Price (P₀):** \$20,0000  
2. **Depreciation Rate (r):** 21% per year  
3. **Number of Years (t):** 2010 - 2007 = 3 years

The formula for the depreciated value (P) after \( t \) years is:

\[
P = P₀ \times (1 - r)^t
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P = 200000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
\]

\[
P = 200000 \times (0.79)^3
\]

First, calculate \( 0.79^3 \):

\[
0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \\
0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.5 \text{ (approximately)} \\
\]

Now, multiply by the initial price:

\[
P \approx 200000 \times 0.5 = 100000.5
\]

**Final Answer:** The car will be worth approximately **\$100000.50** in 2010.
