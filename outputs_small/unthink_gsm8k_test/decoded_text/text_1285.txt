To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we'll subtract the meals already given out from the total number of meals.

**Total meals to distribute:** 1,360

**Meals given out:**
- **Friday:** 64 meals
- **Saturday:** 30 meals
- **Sunday:** 48 meals

**Total meals given out:**
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

**Meals remaining to distribute:**
1,360 - 142 = 1,222 meals

\boxed{1222}
