Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle.

**Given:**
- Steve took **10 hours** to complete the puzzle.
- Anna took **2 hours more than half of Steve's time**.

**Step 1: Calculate Half of Steve's Time**
\[
\text{Half of Steve's time} = \frac{10\ \text{hours}}{2} = 5\ \text{hours}
\]

**Step 2: Add 2 Hours to Half of Steve's Time**
\[
\text{Anna's time} = 5\ \text{hours} + 2\ \text{hours} = 7\ \text{hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{7\ \text{hours}}
\]
