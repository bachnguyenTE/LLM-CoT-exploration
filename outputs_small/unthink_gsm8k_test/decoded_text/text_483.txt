**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of songs Luri has:**
   - Gabriel has 20 songs.
   - Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
   - **Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs.**

2. **Calculate the total capacity of each player:**
   - Both Gabriel and Luri's portable media players can store up to **100 songs**.

3. **Find out how many more songs each can add:**
   - ** Gabriel can add:** \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.
   - ** Luri can add:** \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

4. **Determine how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:**
   - **Difference = Gabriel's additional songs - Luri's additional songs = 80 - 40 = 40 songs.**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{40}\)
