Q: Billy is buying some candy with $10 his father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Money Billy Has:**
   Billy has \$10.

2. **Cost of Candy:**
   - Candy costs \$1.50 per pound.

3. **Amount Spent on Candy:**
   Let’s denote the number of pounds of candy Billy buys as \( x \).
   \[
   \text{Cost of candy} = 1.50x
   \]

4. **Change Received:**
   \[
   \text{Change} = 10.00 - 1.50x
   \]

5. **Spending on Gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs.
   - Number of gumballs bought: 40
   - Cost per gumball: \$0.050

   First, calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:
   \[
   \text{Total spent on gumballs} = 40 \times 0.50 = 20.00
   \]

   Since this amount is half of his change:
   \[
   20.00 = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Change})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 20.00 \times 2 = 40.00
   \]

6. **Relating Change to Candy Purchase:**
   The change received is equal to the money not spent on candy:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 10.00 - 1.50x
   \]
   \[
   40.00 = 10.00 - 1.50x
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   1.50x = 10.00 - 40.00
   \]
   \[
   1.50x = -30.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-30.00}{1.500} = -20
   \]

   **Wait a minute!** This result doesn't make sense because Billy cannot buy a negative number of pounds of candy. There must be an error in the calculations.

   Let's re-examine the steps.

8. **Re-examining the Spending on Gumballs:**
   - Billy spends half of his **change** on gumballs.
   - Total spent on gumballs: \$20.00
   - Therefore, the change he received is \$40.00.

   But the change he received is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 10.00 - 1.50x
   \]
   \[
   10.00 - 1.50x = 40.00
   \]
   \[
   -1.50x = 40.00 - 10.00
   \]
   \[
   -1.50x = 30.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{30.00}{-1.50} = -20
   \]

   Again, we get a negative number, which is impossible.

9. **Identifying the Error:**
   It appears there's a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let's re-examine the problem statement.

   - **Billy buys candy with \$10.**
   - **Candy costs \$1.50 per pound.**
   - **After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost \$0.50 each.**
   - **He bought 40 gumballs.**

   Let's correct the approach.

10. **Correct Approach:**
    - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy bought.
    - **Cost of candy:** \( 1.50x \)
    - **Change received:** \( 10.00 - 1.50x \)
    - **Spending on gumballs:** Half of the change is spent on gumballs.
      \[
      \text{Amount spent on gumballs} = \frac{1}{2}(10.00 - 1.50x)
      \]
    - **Number of gumballs bought:** 40
    - **Cost per gumball:** \$0.50
    - **Total cost for gumballs:** \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20.00 \)

    Therefore
