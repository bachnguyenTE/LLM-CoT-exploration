To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Female Lions:** There are **12 female lions** in the enclosure.

2. **Male Lions:** The number of male lions is **half** the number of female lions. 
   - Calculation: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) male lions.

3. **Lion Cubs:** There are **14 lion cubs** in the enclosure.

Now, let's add up all the lions:

- **Female Lions:** 12
- **Male Lions:** 6
- **Lion Cubs:** 14

**Total Lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (cubs) = 32**

\[
\boxed{32}
