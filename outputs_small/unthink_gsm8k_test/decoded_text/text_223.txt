**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Year Advertising:**
   - The company spends **\$15,000** on advertising for the first year.
   - **Amount spent in the first year:** \$15,000

2. **Second Year Advertising:**
   - The company spends **one-third** of the first year's advertising amount on the second year.
   - **Amount spent in the second year:** \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 \)
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{15,000}{3} = 5,000 \)
   - **Amount spent in the second year:** \$5,000

3. **Total Advertising Spent Over Two Years:**
   - **Total amount:** \$15,000 + \$5,000
   - **Calculation:** \( 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000 \)
   - **Total amount spent:** \$22,000

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{22,\!000}
