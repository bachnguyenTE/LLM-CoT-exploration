**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) = Number of Junior programmers
   - Let \( S \) = Number of Senior programmers
   - Total employees = 100

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - Senior programmers are paid \$400 more than Junior programmers.
   - Number of Junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Each Junior programmer is paid \$2000 per month.

3. **Calculate the Number of Junior Programmers:**
   \[
   J = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]
   
4. **Calculate the Number of Senior Programmers:**
   \[
   S = 100 - 48 = 52
   \]
   
5. **Calculate the Monthly Pay for Junior Programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Pay for J} = 48 \times 2000 = 115200
   \]
   
6. **Calculate the Monthly Pay for Senior Programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Pay for S} = 52 \times (2000 + 400) = 52 \times 26400 = 322080
   \]
   
7. **Calculate the Total Monthly Pay for All Programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Pay} = 115200 + 322080 = 437280
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{437280}
\]
