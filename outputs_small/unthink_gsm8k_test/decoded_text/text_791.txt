Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total people on the train initially: 172
- **First stop:**
  - 47 people get off
  - 13 people get on
- **Second stop:**
  - 38 people get off

**Solution:**

1. **After the first stop:**
   - **People getting off:** 47
   - **People getting on:** +13
   - **Total change:** -47 + 13 = -34
   - **Total people on the train:** 172 - 34 = **138**

2. **After the second stop:**
   - **People getting off:** 38
   - **Total people on the train:** 138 - 38 = **100**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{100}
