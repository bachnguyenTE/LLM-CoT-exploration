Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- One set of twins (2 people).
- One set of triplets (3 people).
- One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
- Combined ages of all individuals are 44.

**Let’s define variables:**
- Let \( t \) be the age of one twin.
- Let \( r \) be the age of one triplet.

**From the problem:**
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet:
   \[
   t = r + 7
   \]
2. The combined ages of all individuals are 44:
   \[
   2t + 3r = 44
   \]

**Substitute \( t \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
\[
2(r + 7) + 3r = 44
\]
\[
2r + 14 + 3r = 44
\]
\[
5r + 14 = 44
\]
\[
5r = 44 - 14
\]
\[
5r = 30
\]
\[
r = \frac{30}{5} = 6
\]

**Now, find \( t \):**
\[
t = r + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
