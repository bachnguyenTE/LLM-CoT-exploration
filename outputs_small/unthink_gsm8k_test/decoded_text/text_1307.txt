**Solution:**

James is assembling 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   \[
   4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of screws needed:**
   \[
   16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 12 \text{ screws}
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of screws James has from the total needed:**
   \[
   40 \text{ screws} - 12 \text{ screws} = 32 \text{ screws left}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
