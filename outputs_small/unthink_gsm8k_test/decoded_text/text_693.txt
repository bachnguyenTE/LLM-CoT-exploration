Q: Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?

To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we'll calculate the number of each color square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**  
   There are **14 red squares**.

2. **Blue Squares:**  
   There are **4 more blue squares than red squares**.  
   So, blue squares = red squares + 4 = 14 + 4 = **18 blue squares**.

3. **Green Squares:**  
   There are **6 more green squares than blue squares**.  
   So, green squares = blue squares + 6 = 18 + 6 = **24 green squares**.

4. **White Squares:**  
   There are **12 fewer white squares than green squares**.  
   So, white squares = green squares - 12 = 24 - 12 = **12 white squares**.

5. **Total Squares:**  
   Now, add up all the squares:  
   Total = red + blue + green + white  
   Total = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = **68 squares**

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area is **68 square feet**.

\boxed{68}
