**Solution:**

Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars. Each car costs \$20,000. Let's break down the total cost step by step.

1. **Cost of the Cars:**
   \[
   12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$264,000
   \]

2. **Tax on the Cars:**
   Mark pays 10% tax on the cars.
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$264,000 = 0.10 \times \$264,000 = \$6,440.0
   \]

3. **Registration Fees:**
   Mark pays \$1,000 on registration for each car.
   \[
   12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   Add the cost of the cars, tax, and registration fees.
   \[
   \$264,000 + \$6,440.00 + \$12,000 = \$282,440.0
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$282,440.00}
\]
