To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class:**
   
   - There are **30 students** in the class.
   - Each student sold **10 lollipops** on average.
   
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of purchasing the lollipops:**
   
   - Each lollipop costs **\$0.5**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipops} = \$150
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   
   - Each lollipop was sold for **\$0.8**.
   
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipops} = \$240
   \]

4. **Determine the profit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$240 - \$150 = \$90
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$90}
\]
