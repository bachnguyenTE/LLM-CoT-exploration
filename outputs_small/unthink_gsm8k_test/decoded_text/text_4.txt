To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Feed per Chicken per Day:**
   - Each chicken receives **3 cups** of mixed feed (seeds, mealworms, vegetables) daily.

2. **Total Feeds Given:**
   - **Morning:** 15 cups
   - **Afternoon:** 25 cups
   - **Total Given in Two Meals:** \(15 + 25 = 40\) cups

3. **Total Feeds for the flock:**
   - **Number of Chickens:** 20
   - **Total Daily Feed Requirement:** \(20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60\) cups

4. **Feeds Given in Two Meals:**
   - **Total Given:** 40 cups

5. **Feeds Needed for the Final Meal:**
   - **Remaining Feed:** \(60 - 40 = 20\) cups

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{20}\) cups
