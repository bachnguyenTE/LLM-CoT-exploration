**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Marbles:** Mazie has 52 marbles to give to two twins, Dallas and Darla.

2. **Marbles Given to Dallas:**
   - Dallas receives some marbles and then drops 4 of them in the playground.
   - After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has a total of 21 marbles.

   Let \( D \) represent the number of marbles Dallas received initially.

   \[
   D - 4 = 21
   \]

   Solving for \( D \):

   \[
   D = 21 + 4 = 25
   \]

   So, Dallas received **25 marbles**.

3. **Marbles Given to Darla:**
   - Since the total marbles given to both twins is 52, and Dallas received 25 marbles, Darla must have received the remaining marbles.

   \[
   \text{Marbles to Darla} = 52 - 25 = 27
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Mazie gave Darla \(\boxed{27}\) marbles.
