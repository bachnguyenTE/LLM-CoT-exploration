**Solution:**

To determine how much Winston spent on pick his own fruit, we'll calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum them up.

1. **Peaches:**
   - **Price per pound:** \$2.00
   - **Pounds picked:** 6
   - **Total cost for peaches:** \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - **Price per pound:** \$1.00
   - **Pounds picked:** 8
   - **Total cost for plums:** \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - **Price per pound:** \$3.00
   - **Pounds picked:** 6
   - **Total cost for apricots:** \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 \)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - **Sum of all costs:** 
     \[
     \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$38.0}
\]
