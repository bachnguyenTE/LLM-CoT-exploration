**Solution:**

To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we'll calculate the total cost for each color of balls and then sum them up.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - **Number of Red Balls:** 3
   - **Cost per Red Ball:** \$9
   - **Total Cost for Red Balls:** \( 3 \times \$9 = \$27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - **Number of Blue Balls:** 11
   - **Cost per Blue Ball:** \$5
   - **Total Cost for Blue Balls:** \( 11 \times \$5 = \$55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - **Number of Green Balls:** 25
   - **Cost per Green Ball:** \$3
   - **Total Cost for Green Balls:** \( 25 \times \$3 = \$75 \)

4. **Total Amount Received:**
   - **Sum of All Costs:** \( \$27 + \$55 + \$75 = \$157 \)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$157}
