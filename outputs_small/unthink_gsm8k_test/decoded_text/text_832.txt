**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Eva's Savings:**
   - Eva has saved **\$20.00**.

2. **Anthony's Savings:**
   - Anthony has saved **\$10.00** more than Eva.
   - **Anthony's Savings = Eva's Savings + \$10.00**
   - **Anthony's Savings = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00**

3. **Roy's Savings:**
   - Roy has saved **40% more** than Anthony.
   - To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
     - **40% of \$30.00 = 0.40 × \$30.00 = \$12.60**
   - **Roy's Savings = Anthony's Savings + \$12.60**
   - **Roy's Savings = \$30.00 + \$12.60 = \$42.60**

**Final Answer:**
Roy has saved **\$42.60**.

\boxed{42.60}
