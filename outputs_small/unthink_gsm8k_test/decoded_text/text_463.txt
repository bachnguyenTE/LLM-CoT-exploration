**Solution:**

To determine the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip and add it to the original cost of the pizza.

1. **Calculate the Tip:**
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times \$15 = \$3
   \]

2. **Add the Tip to the Original Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \$15 + \$3 = \$18
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$18}
\]
