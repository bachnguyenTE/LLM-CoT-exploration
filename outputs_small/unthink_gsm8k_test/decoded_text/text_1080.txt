A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

We are given that **every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish**, and we need to determine how many jellyfish **5 springs working at the same rate would create in 4 hours.**

1. **Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3,600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 * 3,600 = 14,400 seconds

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   
   - **Rate per spring:** 1 jellyfish every 1 second
   - **Total jellyfish per spring in 4 hours:** 14,400 jellyfish

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs:**
   
   - **Total jellyfish for 5 springs:** 14,400 * 5 = 72,200 jellyfish

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{72,\!200}
\]
