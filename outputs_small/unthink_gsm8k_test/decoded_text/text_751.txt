Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther found in the pile.

1. **Initial Bananas:**
   - Gunther starts with **48 bananas** hidden under a fern branch.

2. **First Theft by Arnold:**
   - Arnold steals half of the bananas.
   - **Stealing:** \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas.
   - **Remaining Bananas:** \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.

3. **Second Addition by Gunther:**
   - The next day, Gunther adds **25 bananas** to his pile.
   - **Added Bananas:** \( 24 + 25 = 29 \) bananas.

4. **Third Theft by Arnold:**
   - Later that evening, Arnold steals **12 bananas**.
   - **Stealing:** \( 29 - 12 = 17 \) bananas.

5. **Final Addition by Gunther:**
   - On the third day, Gunther adds **6 bananas** to his pile.
   - **Added Bananas:** \( 17 + 6 = 23 \) bananas.

6. **Total Bananas Found by Gunther:**
   - After all the additions and subtractions, Gunther ends up with **23 bananas** in the pile.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
