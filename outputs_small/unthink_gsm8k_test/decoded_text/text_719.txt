**Solution:**

First, determine the number of sacks Goldy gave to her cousin and brother:

\[
\text{Sacks given to cousin} = 3
\]
\[
\text{Sacks given to brother} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Total sacks given} = 3 + 4 = 7
\]

Next, calculate the total kilograms of rice given to her cousin and brother:

\[
\text{Kilograms per sack} = 25
\]
\[
\text{Total kilograms given} = 7 \times 25 = 175
\]

**Answer:**  
Goldy gave a total of \(\boxed{175}\) kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.
