Gerald works at a daycare that pays him \$30 every day. He worked for an entire week and spent a total of \$100. To find out how much he has left, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   \[
   \text{Daily Pay} \times \text{Days Worked} = \$30 \times 7 = \$210
   \]

2. **Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$210 - \$100 = \$110
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
Gerald has \$110 left.
