Q: Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began.

1. **Total Letters needing Stamps:** 60

2. **Letters Stamped:** Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps.

   \[
   \text{Letters Stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Letters Already Stamped:** After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

4. **Finding the Original Number:**

   Let \( x \) be the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began.

   When Jennie stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, she adds 22 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters.

   \[
   x + 22 = 30
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = 30 - 22 = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{10}\)
