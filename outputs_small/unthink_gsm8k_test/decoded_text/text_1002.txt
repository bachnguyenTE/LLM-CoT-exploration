**Solution:**

Let's determine the number of chocolate bars in one box.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - Lisa sold \( 3 \frac{1}{2} \) boxes.
   - Peter sold \( 4 \frac{1}{2} \) boxes.
   - Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

   Therefore, the total number of boxes sold is:
   \[
   3\frac{1}{2} + 4\frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]

   Since each box contains \( x \) chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:
   \[
   8x = 64
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{64}{8} = 8
   \]

**Answer:**  
\boxed{8}
