Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Paul initially has 52 marbles.
- His friend gives him 28 more marbles.
- Paul then loses \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his marbles.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles after receiving the friend's marbles.**

\[
52 \text{ marbles} + 28 \text{ marbles} = 80 \text{ marbles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many marbles Paul loses.**

\[
\frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 80 \text{ marbles} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ marbles}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the lost marbles from the total to find the remaining marbles.**

\[
80 \text{ marbles} - 20 \text{ marbles} = 68 \text{ marbles}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
