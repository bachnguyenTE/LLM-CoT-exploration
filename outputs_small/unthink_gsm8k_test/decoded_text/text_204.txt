**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - **Green Pens:** 22
   - **Yellow Pens:** 10

2. **Pens Bought:**
   - **Blue Pens:** 6 bags, with 9 pens in each bag.
     - Total blue pens = 6 bags × 9 pens/bag = **54 pens**
   - **Red Pens:** 2 bags, with 6 pens in each bag.
     - Total red pens = 2 bags × 6 pens/bag = **12 pens**

3. **Total Pens:**
   - **Green Pens + Yellow Pens + Blue Pens + Red Pens**
   - **22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{98}
