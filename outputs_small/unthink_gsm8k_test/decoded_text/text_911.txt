**Solution:**

Colby is paid \$0.20 for each package he completes. He works at a rate of 50 packages per hour (since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour). 

To find his daily earnings:

1. **Calculate the number of packages completed per hour:**
   \[
   50 \text{ packages/hour} - 10 \text{ packages/hour} = 40 \text{ packages/hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of packages completed in an 8-hour workday:**
   \[
   40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings for the day:**
   \[
   320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$64.0}
\]
