**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cable Subscription Cost:**
   - Tim has a cable subscription that costs \$60 per month.

2. **Subscription Services:**
   - Netflix: \$10/month
   - Hulu: \$10/month
   - Disney Plus: \$10/month

3. **Total Cost Without Bundling:**
   - Netflix + Hulu + Disney Plus = \$10 + \$10 + \$10 = **\$30/month**

4. **Savings by Bundling:**
   - ** Netflix + Hulu:** \$10 + \$10 = **\$10/month**
   - **Disney Plus:** \$10/month
   - **Total Savings:** \$10 + \$10 = **\$20/month**

5. **Total Savings Over a Month:**
   - **Savings:** \$20

6. **Total Savings Over a Year:**
   - **Savings:** \$20/month × 12 months = **\$240**

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{240}
