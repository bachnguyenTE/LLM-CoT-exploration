**Solution:**

To determine how much change the cashier gives back, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   \[
   \$4.20 \, \$9.45, \text{and} \$1.35
   \]
   
2. **Add the amounts together:**
   \[
   4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
   \]
   \[
   13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
   \]
   
3. **Subtract the total cost from the amount paid:**
   \[
   \$20.00 - \$5.00 = \$14.90
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$14.90}
\]
