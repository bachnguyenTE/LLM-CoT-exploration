Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
- **Ali** had \$21.
- **Leila** gave him half of her \$100.
- **How much does Ali have now?**

**Solution:**

1. **Start with Ali's initial amount:**
   Ali had \$21.

2. **Calculate half of Leila's money:**
   Leila gave him half of her \$100.
   \[
   \text{Half of } \$100 = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
   \]

3. **Add the amount Leila gave to Ali's initial amount:**
   \[
   \$21 + \$50 = \$71
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{71}
\]
