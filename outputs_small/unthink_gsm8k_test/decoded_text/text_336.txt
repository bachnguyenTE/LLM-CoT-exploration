**Solution:**

1. **Initial Investment:**
   - Maria buys 8 shares at \$8 each.
   - **Total Investment = 8 shares × \$8 = \$64**

2. **First Year Increase:**
   - Stock price increases by 50%.
   - **Increase = 50% of \$64 = 0.5 × \$64 = \$35.20**
   - **New Stock Price = \$64 + \$35.20 = \$99.20**
   - **Total Value After First Year = 8 shares × \$99.20 = \$793.60**

3. **Second Year Decrease:**
   - Stock price decreases by 25%.
   - **Decrease = 25% of \$793.60 = 0.25 × \$793.60 = \$198.40**
   - **New Stock Price = \$793.60 - \$198.40 = \$595.20**
   - **Total Value After Second Year = 8 shares × \$595.20 = \$4,761.60**

4. **Final Value:**
   - **Final Value = \$4,761.60**

**Answer:** \boxed{\$4,\!761.60}
