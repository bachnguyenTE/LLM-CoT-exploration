**Solution:**

Let's break down Theo's expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of Business Suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at \$100 each.
   - Total cost for suits = \( 6 \times \$100 = \$600 \).

2. **Cost of Suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at \$50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = \( 3 \times \$50 = \$150 \).

3. **Flight Ticket Cost:**
   - The flight ticket costs \$700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - First, calculate 5 times the cost of a business suit:
     \[
     5 \times \$100 = \$500
     \]
   - Then, add \$700 to this amount:
     \[
     \$500 + \$700 = \$1200
     \]
   - So, the flight ticket costs \$1200.

4. **Total Expenditure:**
   - Sum up all the costs:
     \[
     \$600 \ (\text{suits}) + \$150 \ (\text{suitcases}) + \$1200 \ (\text{flight ticket}) = \$1900
     \]

5. **Savings and Remaining Amount:**
   - Theo wishes to save \$2000 for the trip.
   - He has already spent \$1900.
   - To find out how much he needs to spend on buying gifts:
     \[
     \$1900 \ (\text{total spent}) - \$2000 \ (\text{savings}) = -\$100
     \]
   - **Note:** The negative value indicates that Theo has already saved more than his planned expenditure.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{-\$100}
\]

This means Theo has already saved \$100 more than his planned trip expenses.
