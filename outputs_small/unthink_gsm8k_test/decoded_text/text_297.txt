To determine by how many crates Sam was off from his target, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week:**

   - **Monday:** 0 crates (closed)
   - **Tuesday:** 15 crates
   - **Wednesday:** 12 crates
   - **Thursday:** 18 crates
   - **Friday:** 0 crates (closed)
   - **Saturday/Weekend:** 20 crates

   \[
   \text{Total sold} = 15 + 12 +18 +20 = 65 \text{ crates}
   \]

2. **Determine the target:**

   Sam aimed to sell **120 crates** in the week.

3. **Find the difference between the target and what was sold:**

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 120 - 65 = 59 \text{ crates}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   Sam was **59 crates** short of his target.

\[
\boxed{59}
\]
