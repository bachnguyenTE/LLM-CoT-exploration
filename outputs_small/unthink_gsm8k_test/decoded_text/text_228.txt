To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Kalinda's rate:**
   - Kalinda can add **4 pieces per minute**.

2. **Calculate her mom's rate:**
   - Her mom can place **half as many pieces per minute** as Kalinda.
   - **Mom's rate = 4 pieces/minute ÷ 2 = 2 pieces/minute**.

3. **Determine their combined rate:**
   - **Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces/minute**.

4. **Calculate the total time needed:**
   - **Total pieces = 360**
   - **Time = Total pieces ÷ Combined rate = 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes**

5. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - **60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour**

**Final Answer:** \boxed{1\ \text{hour}}
