Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial Number of Pokemon Cards:**
   Elaine starts with **20 Pokemon cards**.

2. **First Month:**
   - **Collected:** Three times the initial number.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) cards.
   - **Total After First Month:** \( 20 + 60 = 80 \) cards.

3. **Second Month:**
   - **Collected:** 20 fewer than the first month.
   - Calculation: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) cards.
   - **Total After Second Month:** \( 80 + 40 = 120 \) cards.

4. **Third Month:**
   - **Collected:** Twice the combined number from the first and second months.
   - Combined from First and Second Months: \( 60 + 40 = 100 \) cards.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) cards.
   - **Total After Third Month:** \( 120 + 220 = 342 \) cards.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{342}
