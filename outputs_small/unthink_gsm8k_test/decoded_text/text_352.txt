Q: After Andrea saved some money, she then spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. If she had $36 in the beginning, how much did Andrea save?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Andrea starts with **\$36**.

2. **Savings:**
   Let \( S \) be the amount Andrea saved.

3. **Total Money After Saving:**
   After saving, Andrea has \( 36 + S \) dollars.

4. **Spending:**
   - She spent **\$11** on an **11**-inch sweater.
   - She also gave her **brother** **\$4**.

   So, the total amount she spent is:
   \[
   11 + 4 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money:**
   After spending \$15, the remaining money is:
   \[
   (36 + S) - 15 = 31 + S
   \]

6. **Equation Setup:**
   Since the problem doesn't specify how much money Andrea has left after her purchases, we assume that the question is asking for the amount she saved, which is \( S \).

7. **Final Answer:**
   The amount Andrea saved is:
   \[
   \boxed{S}
   \]

However, if there's additional information provided in the original question that specifies how much money Andrea has left, we would need to use that to solve for \( S \). As it stands, the amount Andrea saved is represented by \( S \).
