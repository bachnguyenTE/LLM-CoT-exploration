**Solution:**

To determine how much shorter the candle will be after burning from **1:00 PM** to **5:0 PM**, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Time Burned:**
   
   - **Start Time:** 1:00 PM
   - **End Time:** 5:00 PM
   - **Total Duration:** 5:0 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

2. **Determine the Rate of Melting:**
   
   - **Melting Rate:** 2 centimeters per hour

3. **Calculate the Total Length Lost:**
   
   - **Total Length Lost = Melting Rate × Time Burned**
   - **Total Length Lost = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 cm**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{8\ \text{centimeters}}
\]
