**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age.
   - Let \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Currently, Duncan is 60 years old.

3. **Translate the Information into Equations:**
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
   - According to the problem: \( D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \).

4. **Substitute the Known Value of Duncan's Age:**
   - \( 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)
   - \( 58 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)

5. **Solve for Adam's Current Age:**
   - Divide both sides by 2: \( 29 = A - 4 \)
   - Add 4 to both sides: \( A = 33 \)

6. **Determine Adam's Age in 8 Years:**
   - Adam's age in 8 years will be \( 33 + 8 = 41 \) years.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{41}
\]
