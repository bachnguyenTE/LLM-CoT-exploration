Q: Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

**Solution:**

1. **Convert the length of the flower bed to inches:**
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the total space needed for the plants:**
   - **Width of each plant:** \(12\) inches
   - **Space between each plant:** \(1.5\) feet \(= 18\) inches
   - **Total space per plant:** \(12 + 18 = 30\) inches

3. **Calculate the number of plants needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 41 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of additional plants needed:**
   \[
   41 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ existing plants} = 24 \text{ additional plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   24 \text{ plants} \times \$6/\text{plant} = \$144
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$144}
\]
