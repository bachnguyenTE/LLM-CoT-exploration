Q: Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption:**
   
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 1 = 12 \text{ kW/h}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new daily electric consumption after adding the device:**
   
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in daily consumption:**
   
   \[
   14 \text{ kW/h} - 12 \text{ kW/h} = 2 \text{ kW/h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly consumption difference:**
   
   \[
   2 \text{ kW/h} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]

5. **Convert the weekly consumption difference to dollars:**
   
   \[
   14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$21.10}
\]
