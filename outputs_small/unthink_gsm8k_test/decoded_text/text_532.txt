Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
2. In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.

**Find:**
How many years separate the age of Jame and his cousin now.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = **22 years old**.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cousin's current age.
   - In 8 years, the cousin's age will be \( C + 8 \).
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = **30 years old**.
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years = \( 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Find the cousin's current age:**
   - The cousin's age in 8 years is 55.
   - Therefore, the cousin's current age = 55 - 8 = **47 years old**.

4. **Determine the age difference:**
   - Jame is 22 now.
   - Cousin is 47 now.
   - Age difference = 47 - 22 = **25 years**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{25}
