**Solution:**

Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Martha's Age:**
   - Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.
   - Mike is 24 years old.
   - Therefore, Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years.
   - Martha = 24 - 4 = **20 years old**.

2. **Jeff's Age:**
   - Jeff is 100 years older than his younger sister, Martha.
   - Martha is 22 years old.
   - Therefore, Jeff's age = Martha's age + 100 years.
   - Jeff = 22 + 100 = **132 years old**.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{132}
