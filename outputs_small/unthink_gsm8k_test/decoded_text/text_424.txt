To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we'll calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

1. **4 buses**: Each bus can hold 60 employees.
   \[
   4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **6 min minibusses**: Each min bus can hold 30 employees.
   \[
   6 \text{ min minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/min bus} = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **10 min minivans**: Each min van can hold 15 employees.
   \[
   10 \text{ min minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/min van} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

**Total Capacity:**
\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 578 \text{ employees}
\]

\[
\boxed{578}
\]
