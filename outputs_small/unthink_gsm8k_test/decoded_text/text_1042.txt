Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

1. **First Race:**
   - **Loss:** Johnny's dad lost **\$5**.

2. **Second Race:**
   - **Loss:** He won **\$1** more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - **Calculation:** 
     \[
     \text{Twice the loss} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total win} = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]
   - **Net Result:** He **lost \$11** on the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - **Loss:** He lost **1.5 times** as much as he won in the second race.
   - **Calculation:**
     \[
     \text{Loss} = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]
   - **Net Result:** He **lost \$16.50** on the third race.

4. **Total Losses:**
   - **First Race Loss:** \$5
   - **Second Race Loss:** \$11
   - **Third Race Loss:** \$16.50
   - **Total Loss:** 
     \[
     5 + 11 + 16.50 = 32.50
     \]

5. **Average Loss:**
   - **Total Losses:** \$32.50
   - **Number of Races:** 3
   - **Average Loss per Race:**
     \[
     \frac{32.50}{3} = 10.83
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10.83}
\]
