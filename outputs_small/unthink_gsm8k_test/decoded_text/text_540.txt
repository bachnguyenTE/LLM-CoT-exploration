Q: $18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the boy has now.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - **Total money:** \$18
   - **Number of boys:** 3

   Let's denote the shares of the three boys as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

   Since the problem doesn't specify how the money was initially shared, we'll assume that the shares are equal. Therefore:
   \[
   A = B = C = \frac{18}{3} = \$6
   \]

2. **Eldest's Additional Money:**
   - **Eldest's share after adding \$5:** 
     \[
     A + 5 = 6 + 5 = \$11
     \]
   - **Following day's additional money:** 
     \[
     11 + 10 = \$11
     \]
   - **Total so far:** 
     \[
     11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending:**
   - **Spending \$8:** 
     \[
     11 - 8 = \$3
     \]
   - **Remaining money:** 
     \[
     \$3
     \]

4. **Saving More:**
   - **Tripling the remaining money:** 
     \[
     3 \times 3 = \$9
     \]
   - **Total money now:** 
     \[
     9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
