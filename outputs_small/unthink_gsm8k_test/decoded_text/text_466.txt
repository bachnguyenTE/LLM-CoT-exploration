To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, let's break down the calculations step by step.

### **Becky's Purchase:**
- **Number of Apples:** 20
- **Price per Apple:** \$0.45
- **Discount:** \$1

**Total Cost Before Discount:**
\[
20 \text{ apples} \times \$0.45/\text{apple} = \$9.00
\]

**Total Cost After Discount:**
\[
\$9.00 - \$1.00 = \$8.00
\]

### **Kelly's Purchase:**
- **Number of Apples:** 20
- **Price per Apple:** \$0.50
- **Discount:** 10%

**Total Cost Before Discount:**
\[
20 \text{ apples} \times \$0.50/\text{apple} = \$10.00
\]

**Discount Amount:**
\[
10\% \times \$10.00 = \$1.00
\]

**Total Cost After Discount:**
\[
\$10.00 - \$1.00 = \$8.90
\]

### **Difference in Payment:**
\[
\$8.90 - \$8.00 = \$0.90
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$0.90}
\]
