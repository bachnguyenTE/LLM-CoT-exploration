To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Students:** There are 27 students in the class.

2. **Glue Sticks per Student:** Each student will receive 2 glue sticks.

3. **Total Glue Sticks Needed:** 
   \[
   27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
   \]

4. **Glue Sticks per Pack:** Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

5. **Calculating Packs Needed:**
   - Divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:
     \[
     \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs}
     \]
   - Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number.

6. **Final Purchase:**
   - **7 packs** of glue sticks.

**Answer:** Mr. Jackson needs to buy \boxed{7} packs of glue sticks.
