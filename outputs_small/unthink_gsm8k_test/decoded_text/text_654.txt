A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

Lori needs to make **2 deviled egg halves** using **1 whole egg**. This means she needs **1 egg per 2 halves**.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs needed per guest:**
   
   Each guest eats **3 deviled egg halves**. Since 2 halves require 1 egg, 3 halves would require:
   
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves per egg}} = 1.5 \text{ eggs per guest}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 16 guests:**
   
   \[
   16 \text{ guests} \times 1.5 \text{ eggs per guest} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   
   Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs:
   
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ dozen}}
\]
