Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - James's play set has 80 toys.

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Jonathan needs **2 more toys** than he currently has to have enough toys for a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
   - James's play set has 80 toys.
   - A play set five times larger than James's has \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \) toys.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Jonathan needs 440 toys to have a play set five times larger than James's.
   - Jonathan currently has \( J \) toys, and he needs 2 more toys.
   - Therefore, \( J + 2 = 440 \).

4. **Solve for \( J \):**
   \[
   J + 2 = 440 \\
   J = 440 - 2 \\
   J = 438
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{438}
   \]
