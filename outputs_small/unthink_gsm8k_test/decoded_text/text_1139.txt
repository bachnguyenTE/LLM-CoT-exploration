Q: Russell orders his favorite bagels online.  Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of bagels ordered:**
   - Each pack contains 9 bagels.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   \[
   4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Each pack costs \$10.00.
   - 4 packs cost:
   \[
   4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00
   \]

3. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   - **Discount amount:**
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40.00 = \$4.40
   \]
   - **Total cost after discount:**
   \[
   \$44.00 - \$4.40 = \$39.60
   \]

4. **Find the cost per bagel:**
   - Total cost after discount: \$39.60
   - Number of bagels: 36
   \[
   \frac{\$39.60}{36} = \$1.10 \text{ per bagel}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1.10}
\]
