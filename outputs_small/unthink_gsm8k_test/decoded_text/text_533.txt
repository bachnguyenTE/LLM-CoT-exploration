Let's break down the problem step by step to find the cost of one monitor.

**Given:**
- Total cost of items: \$2,400
- Number of items: 1 computer, 2 monitors, 1 printer
- Errol paid \$400 less for the printer than the computer
- Cost of the computer: \$1,100

**Step 1: Determine the cost of the printer.**

Since the printer cost \$400 less than the computer:
\[
\text{Cost of printer} = \text{Cost of computer} - \$440
\]
\[
\text{Cost of printer} = \$1,100 - \$440 = \$660
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the computer and printer.**

\[
\text{Total cost of computer and printer} = \$1,100 + \$664 = \$1,764
\]

**Step 3: Find the total cost of the two monitors.**

\[
\text{Total cost of two monitors} = \text{Total cost of all items} - \text{Total cost of computer and printer}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of two monitors} = \$2,400 - \$1,764 = \$636
\]

**Step 4: Determine the cost of one monitor.**

\[
\text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\text{Total cost of two monitors}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\$636}{2} = \$318
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$318}
\]
