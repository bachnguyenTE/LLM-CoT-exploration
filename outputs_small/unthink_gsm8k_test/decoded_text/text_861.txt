Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Claire** earns 1 girl scout badge every month.
- **Amber** takes **twice as long** to earn a badge than Claire.
- **Wendy** earns **three times the amount** of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

**Objective:**
Find out how many **more badges** Wendy earns compared to Amber in a **1-year** time frame.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Rate of Earning for Each

1. **Claire's Rate:**
   - Earnings: 1 badge per month.
   - **Claire's Rate (C):** \( C = 1 \) badge/month.

2. **Amber's Rate:**
   - Takes **twice as long** to earn a badge.
   - If Claire earns 1 badge in 1 month, Amber takes 2 months to earn 1 badge.
   - **Amber's Rate (A):** 
     \[
     A = \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2 \text{ months}} = 0.5 \text{ badges/month}
     \]

3. **Wendy's Rate:**
   - Earnings: Three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - If Claire earns 1 badge in 1 month, Wendy earns 3 badges in 1 month.
   - **Wendy's Rate (W):** 
     \[
     W = 3 \times 1 \text{ badge/month} = 3 \text{ badges/month}
     \]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Badges Earned in 1 Year

1. **Claire's Badges in 1 Year:**
   - 1 month = 1 badge.
   - 1 year = 12 months.
   - Total badges = \( 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \).

2. **Amber's Badges in 1 Year:**
   - Amber earns 0.5 badges per month.
   - Total badges = \( 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1 \text{ badge} \) in 2 months.
   - Wait, hold on. Let's correct that.

   **Correct Calculation for Amber:**
   - Amber takes 2 months to earn 1 badge.
   - In 1 year (12 months), how many badges does she earn?
   - Number of badges = \( \frac{12 \text{ months}}{1 \text{ badge}} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ badges} \).

3. **Wendy's Badges in 1 Year:**
   - Wendy earns 3 badges per month.
   - Total badges = \( 3 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 36 \text{ badges} \).

---

### Step 3: Determine the Difference in Badges Earned

- **Wendy's Badges:** 36 badges
- **Amber's Badges:** 24 badges
- **Difference:** \( 36 - 24 = 12 \text{ badges} \)

---

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
