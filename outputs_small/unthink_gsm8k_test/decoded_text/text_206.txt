**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Scenario:**
   - **Number of rides per week:** 5
   - **Distance per ride:** 25 kilometers
   - **Number of weeks:** 4

   **Total distance for the first scenario:**
   \[
   5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - **Number of rides per week:** 2
   - **Distance per ride:** 60 kilometers
   - **Number of weeks:** 3

   **Total distance for the second scenario:**
   \[
   2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   \[
   500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 866 \text{ km}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{866}
\]
