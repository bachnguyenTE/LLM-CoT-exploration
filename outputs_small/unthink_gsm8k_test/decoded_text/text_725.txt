To determine the average time it takes for a cat and a dog to eat the same number of sausages, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **Cat:** Eats **9 sausages** in **30 minutes**.
- **Dog:** Eats the same **9 sausages** in **2/3 the amount of time** the cat takes.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Time the Dog Takes to Eat 9 Sausages**

The cat takes **30 minutes** to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes **2/3 the amount of time** the cat takes.

\[
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Step 2: Calculate the Average Time**

The average time is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the two times.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{25 \text{ minutes}}
\]
