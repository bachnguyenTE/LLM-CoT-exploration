Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Brian has **20 video games**.
- Brian lost **5 video games** before the comparison was made.
- Bobby has **5 fewer than 3 times** as many video games as Brian does.

**Step 1: Determine the number of video games Brian has after losing 5.**

\[
\text{Brian's games after losing 5} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how many video games Bobby has.**

Bobby has **5 fewer** than 3 times Brian's current number of video games.

\[
\text{Bobby's games} = 3 \times \text{Brian's games} - 5 = 3 \times 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
