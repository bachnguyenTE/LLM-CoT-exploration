**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - Let the cost of a **half-gallon jar** be \( x \) dollars.
   - According to the problem, a **gallon jar** costs \$2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a gallon jar is \( x + 2 \) dollars.

2. **Given Cost of a Gallon Jar:**
   - It's given that a gallon jar costs \$5.
   - So, \( x + 2 = 5 \).

3. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x + 2 = 5 \\
   x = 5 - 2 \\
   x = 3
   \]
   - Therefore, a **half-gallon jar** costs \$3.

4. **Calculating Total Cost:**
   - **Number of gallon jars:** 10
   - **Number of half-gallon jars:** 16
   - **Cost of gallon jars:** \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) dollars
   - **Cost of half-gallon jars:** \( 16 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars
   - **Total cost:** \( 50 + 18 = 68 \) dollars

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
