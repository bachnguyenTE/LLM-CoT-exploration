**Solution:**

To determine how many eggs won't fit on the trays, follow these steps:

1. **Total number of eggs:** 64
2. **Number of eggs each tray can hold:** 24
3. **Number of trays available:** 2

**Step 1:** Calculate the total capacity of both trays.
\[
\text{Total capacity} = 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 2:** Subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs won't fit.
\[
\text{Eggs that won't fit} = 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
