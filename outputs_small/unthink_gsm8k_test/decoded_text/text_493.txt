**Solution:**

1. **Determine the cost per pack after the sale:**
   - **Original price per pack:** \$4.00
   - **Sale:** Buy one, get one free. So, for 2 packs, you only pay for 1 pack.
   - **Cost for 2 packs:** \$4.00

2. **Calculate the total cost after the sale:**
   - **Total cost:** \$4.00

3. **Apply the \$2.00 coupon:**
   - **Total cost after coupon:** \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00

4. **Convert the total cost to cents:**
   - **Total cost in cents:** 2.00 × 100 = 2100 cents

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{2100}
