**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days Billy is volunteering:**
   
   - **Start date:** March 1st
   - **End date:** April 19th
   
   To find the total number of days, we can calculate the days in each month and add them together.

   - **March has 31 days.**
   - **April has 19 days.**
   
   So, the total number of days is:
   
   \[
   31 \text{ (March)} + 19 \text{ (April)} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days Billy actually volunteers:**
   
   Billy takes **20% of the days off**. This means he volunteers on **78% of the days**.

   \[
   50 \text{ days} \times (1 - 0.20) = 55 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Determine Billy's daily help capacity:**
   
   Billy can help **2 people per hour** for **3 hours per day**.

   \[
   2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people Billy helps:**
   
   Multiply the number of days he volunteers by his daily help capacity.

   \[
   55 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ people/day} = 330 \text{ people}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{330}
\]
