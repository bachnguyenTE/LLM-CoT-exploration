**Solution:**

1. **Total Land Area:**
   \[
   80 \text{ square meters}
   \]

2. **First Sale:**
   \[
   \text{Sold half of the land} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 40 \text{ square meters} \times \$50 = \$2,000
   \]

3. **Remaining Land After First Sale:**
   \[
   80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]

4. **Second Sale:**
   \[
   \text{Sold one-fourth of the original land} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 20 \text{ square meters} \times \$30 = \$660
   \]

5. **Remaining Land After Second Sale:**
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]

6. **Third Sale:**
   \[
   \text{Sold the remaining 20 square meters at \$3 per square meter}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 20 \times \$3 = \$60
   \]

7. **Total Revenue:**
   \[
   \$2,000 + \$666 + \$60 = \$2,726
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$2,726}
\]
