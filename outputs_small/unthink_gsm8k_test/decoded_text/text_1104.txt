Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
1. Caroline is three times older than Ben.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris.
3. Chris is 4 years old.

**Step 1:** Determine Ben's age.
- Ben is two times older than Chris.
- Chris's age = 4 years.
- So, Ben's age = 2 × Chris's age = 2 × 4 = 8 years.

**Step 2:** Determine Caroline's age.
- Caroline is three times older than Ben.
- Ben's age = 8 years.
- So, Caroline's age = 3 × Ben's age = 3 × 8 = 24 years.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{24}
