**Solution:**

Emma aims to make **72 vlogs** per month. In the first week, she made **18 vlogs**, and in the second week, **21 vlogs**, and in the third week, **15 vlogs**. To find out how many vlogs she needs to make in the fourth week to reach her goal, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total vlogs made in the first three weeks:**
   
   \[
   18 \text{ (first week)} + 21 \text{ (second week)} + 15 \text{ (third week)} = 54 \text{ vlogs}
   \]

2. **Subtract the total vlogs made from her monthly goal to find out how many she needs to make in the fourth week:**
   
   \[
   72 \text{ (total goal)} - 54 \text{ (vlogs made)} = 18 \text{ vlogs}
   \]

**Answer:** Emma needs to make **18 vlogs** in the fourth week to complete her 72 vlogs per month.
