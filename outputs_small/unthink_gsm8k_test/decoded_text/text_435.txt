**Solution:**

Ray initially has **25 lollipops**.

He keeps **5 lollipops** for himself.

The remaining lollipops are shared equally among his **4 friends**.

**Step 1:** Calculate the number of lollipops left after Ray keeps some.

\[
25 \text{ lollipops} - 5 \text{ lollipops} = 20 \text{ lollipops}
\]

**Step 2:** Divide the remaining lollipops equally among his 4 friends.

\[
\frac{20 \text{ lollipops}}{4 \text{ friends}} = 5 \text{ lollipops per friend}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops.
