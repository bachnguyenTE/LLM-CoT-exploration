**Solution:**

Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Aquarium:**
   - **Cost:** \$10.00
   - **Total:** \$10.0

2. **Pet Store:**
   - **2 Bags of Rocks:**
     - **Cost per bag:** \$2.50
     - **Total for 2 bags:** 2 × \$2.50 = **\$5.00**
   - **3 Pieces of Coral:**
     - **Cost per piece:** \$2.00
     - **Total for 3 pieces:** 3 × \$2.00 = **\$6.00**
   - **Total for Pet Store:** \$5.00 + \$6.00 = **\$11.50**

3. **Fish:**
   - **20 Fish:**
     - **Cost per fish:** \$0.50
     - **Total for 20 fish:** 20 × \$0.50 = **\$11.00**

4. **Fish Food:**

**Total Expenditure:**
- **Aquarium:** \$10.00

**Adding them up:**
\[
\$10.00 + \$11.50 + \$11.00 + \$2.00 = \$34.50
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{34.50}
