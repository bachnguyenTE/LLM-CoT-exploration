Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Gomer ate **5 less than 23 scoops** of mashed potatoes.
- It takes **3 less than 6 potatoes** to make **1 less than 3 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

**Step 1: Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate.**

Gomer ate **5 less than 23 scoops**:
\[
\text{Scoops Gomer ate} = 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
\]

**Step 2: Relate scoops to potatoes.**

It takes **3 less than 6 potatoes** to make **1 less than 3 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

First, find the number of potatoes needed for **1 less than 3 scoops**:
\[
\text{Scoops per potato} = 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops per potato}
\]

This means:
\[
1 \text{ scoop} = 3 \text{ potatoes}
\]

Now, find the number of potatoes needed for **1 less than 3 scoops**:
\[
\text{Scoops} = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]
\[
\text{Potatoes} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ potatoes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate.**

Gomer ate **18 scoops** of mashed potatoes. Since **1 scoop requires 3 potatoes**, the total number of potatoes is:
\[
\text{Total Potatoes} = 18 \times 3 = 54 \text{ potatoes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{54}
\]
