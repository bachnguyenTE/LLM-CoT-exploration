**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Supplies Cost:**
   - Jen needs to pay a total of \$400 for travel supplies.

2. **Travel Cost:**
   - The travel cost is **50% more** than the supplies cost.

3. **Calculating the Increase:**
   - First, find 50% of the supplies cost.
   - \( 50\% \) of \$440 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.50 \times 440 = 243
     \]

4. **Total Travel Cost:**
   - Add the increase to the original supplies cost.
     \[
     440 + 243 = 687
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{687}
\]
