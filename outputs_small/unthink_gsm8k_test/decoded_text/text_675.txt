Q: James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many toys James needs in total.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has **4 toys** for **4 dogs**.
   - There are **8 more dogs** in the shelter now.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James buys **4 toys** to cover the 8 additional dogs.
   - **Total toys after first purchase:** \(4 + 4 = 8\).

3. **Return to Shelter:**
   - James notices there are **twice as many dogs** as when he left.
   - **Number of dogs after first visit:** \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - **Twice as many dogs:** \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs **24 toys** to cover all the dogs.

4. **Second Purchase:**
   - James returns to see **3 dogs** are gone.
   - **Number of dogs after second visit:** \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - **Total toys needed after second visit:** \(21\).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - James initially had **8 toys** after the first purchase.
   - He needed **21 toys** after the second visit.
   - **Total toys James needs:** \(8 + 21 = 29\).

**Final Answer:** James needs a total of \(\boxed{29}\) toys.
