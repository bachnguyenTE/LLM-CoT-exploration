Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much James made.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   - James sold 10 cars, each costing \$25,000.
   - Total cost = 11 cars × \$25,000 = \$285,000.

2. **Determine the total amount paid to the company:**
   - The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars.
   - Amount paid = 33% of \$285,000 = 0.33 × \$285,000 = \$93,750.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total cost - Amount paid
   - Profit = \$285,000 - \$93,750 = \$191,250.

4. **Determine the commission James received:**
   - James got a 10% commission on the profits.
   - Commission = 10% of \$191,250 = 0.10 × \$191,250 = \$19,12.50.

5. **Calculate the total amount James made:**
   - James's total earnings = Amount received from sales + Commission
   - James's total earnings = \$285,000 + \$19,12.50 = \$304,125.

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{\$304,125}
