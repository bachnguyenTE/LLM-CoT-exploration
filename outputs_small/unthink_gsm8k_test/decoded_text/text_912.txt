**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the time John drinks one bottle of water:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every **half hour** (30 minutes).

2. **Calculate the total time John spends drinking water:**
   - **45 minutes** is the time a **normal sudoku puzzle takes**.
   - **Extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:** 
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Find out how many bottles John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - **Number of bottles** = Total time / Time per bottle
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
