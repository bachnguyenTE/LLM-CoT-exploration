To determine how many chairs the restaurant has left after sending some to the carpenter for repair, follow these steps:

1. **Total Normal Chairs:** 170
2. **Total Baby Chairs:** 23
3. **Chairs Sent to Carpenters:**
   - **Normal Chairs:** 20
   - **Baby Chairs:** 13

4. **Calculate Remaining Chairs:**
   - **Remaining Normal Chairs:** \(170 - 20 = 158\)
   - **Remaining Baby Chairs:** \(23 - 13 = 10\)

5. **Total Chairs Left:**
   \[
   158 \text{ (Normal)} + 10 \text{ (Baby)} = 168
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{168}\)
