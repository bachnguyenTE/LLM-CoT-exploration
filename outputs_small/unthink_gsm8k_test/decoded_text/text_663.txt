Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- James delivers a total of **600 newspapers** in a day.
- He delivers **198 newspapers** to **District A**.
- He delivers **209 newspapers** to **District C**.
- We need to find out how many newspapers he delivers to **District B**.

**Let’s denote:**
- \( x \) = number of newspapers delivered to District B.

**Total deliveries equation:**
\[
\text{Total} = \text{District A} + \text{District B} + \text{District C}
\]
\[
600 = 198 + x + 209
\]

**Simplify the equation:**
\[
600 = 198 + 209 + x
\]
\[
600 = 407 + x
\]

**Solve for \( x \):**
\[
x = 600 - 407
\]
\[
x = 193
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{193}
\]
