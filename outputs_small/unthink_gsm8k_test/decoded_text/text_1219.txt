**Solution:**

John manufactures two types of items for his friend Ali:
- **Wooden tables:** 4 tables at \$20 each.
- **Roof frames:** 2 frames at \$10 each.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost for the wooden tables.
\[
4 \text{ tables} \times \$20 \text{ per table} = \$80
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost for the roof frames.
\[
2 \text{ frames} \times \$10 \text{ per frame} = \$20
\]

**Step 3:** Add both amounts to find the total cost.
\[
\$80 + \$20 = \$100
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$100}
