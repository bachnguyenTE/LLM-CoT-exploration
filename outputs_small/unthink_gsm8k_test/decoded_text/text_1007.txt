Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are **9 red sticks**.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - It's mentioned that there are **5 more blue sticks than red sticks**.
   - So, the number of blue sticks = Red sticks + 5
   - Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = **14 blue sticks**

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is **3 less than the blue sticks**.
   - So, the number of yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3
   - Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = **11 yellow stick**

4. **Total Sticks:**
   - Total sticks = Red sticks + Blue sticks + Yellow sticks
   - Total sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = **34 sticks**

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{34}\)
