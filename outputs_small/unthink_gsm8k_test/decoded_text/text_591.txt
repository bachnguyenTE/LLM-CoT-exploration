Q: Four dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much the Mastiff weighed.

1. **Affenpinscher (First Dog):**
   - **Weight:** 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund (Second Dog):**
   - **Weight:** Twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - **Calculation:** \( 2 \times 10 \, \text{pounds} = 20 \, \text{pounds} \).

3. **Papillon (Third Dog):**
   - **Weight:** One-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - **Calculation:** \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \, \text{pounds} = 5.5 \,25 \,25 \,25 \,25 \,25 \, \text{pounds} \).

4. **Mastiff (Fourth Dog):**
   - **Weight:** 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - **Calculation:** \( 44 \times 5.5 \, \text{pounds} = 242 \,242 \, \text{pounds} \).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{242 \, \text{pounds}}
\]
