Q: A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the original price per computer:**
   
   The company planned to buy each computer for \$700.

2. **Calculate the new price after a 10% increase:**
   
   - **10% of \$700:** 
     \[
     0.10 \times 770 = 770
     \]
   - **New price per computer:**
     \[
     770 + 770 = 1540 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Find the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:**
   
   \[
   500 \text{ computers} \times 1540 \text{ dollars/computer} = 8,43,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{8,\!43,\!000}
\]
