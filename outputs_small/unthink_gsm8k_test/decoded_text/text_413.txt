Q: Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. If she makes 50000 candles, how many of them will both smell like wet dog and explode?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>

**Solution:**

We are given the following information:

1. **Total number of candles:** 50,000
2. **Candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode.**
3. **5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like a wet dog.**

We need to find the number of candles that **both** smell like a wet dog and explode.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Defects:**
   - **99% of the candles do not explode.** This means that 1% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.
   - **5% of the more dangerous candles (which are the 1% that do not explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like a wet dog.**

2. **Calculating the Number of Non-Explosive Candles:**
   - **Total non-explosive candles:** 
     \[
     1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 551
     \]
   - **Wait, this doesn't make sense. Let's correct that.**
     - If 99% do not explode, then 1% do. So:
     \[
     1\% \text{ of } 55,000 = 0.01 \times 55,0000 = 551
     \]
     (Note: The original number was 50,000, not 55,000. Let's use 50,000 for accuracy.)
     \[
     1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 5,000
     \]
     So, **5,000 candles do not explode.**

3. **Calculating the Number of Candles that smell like a wet dog:**
   - **5% of the non-explosive candles have this defect:**
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 5,000 = 0.05 \times 5,000 = 250
     \]
     So, **250 candles smell like a wet dog.**

4. **Determining the Number of Wet Dog Smelling Candles that Explode:**
   - The question asks for **candles that both smell like a wet dog and explode.**
   - However, the information provided does not specify that these wet dog defective candles also explode. It only states that 5% of the non-explosive candles have a wet dog defect.
   - Therefore, based on the given data, we cannot directly determine how many wet dog defective candles also explode.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - With the provided information, we cannot calculate the exact number of candles that both smell like a wet dog and explode. The data is insufficient to answer the question as it stands.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{0}
\]

(Note: This answer assumes that the 5% defect rate applies only to the non-explosive candles, and there's no overlap between wet dog defective and explosive candles as per the given information.)
