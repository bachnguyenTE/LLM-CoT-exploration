Q: If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, how many hours will it take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do so?

To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway, let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- **3 Kangaroos** travel across a highway in **18 hours**.
- **Each Turtle** travels at **half the speed** of a kangaroo.

### **Step 1: Determine the Combined Speed of the Kangaroos**
Since all three kangaroos are traveling at the same speed and together they take 18 hours to cover the distance, we can infer that the combined speed of the three kangaroos is sufficient to cover the distance in 18 hours.

Let's denote:
- \( S_k \) = Speed of one kangaroo.
- \( D \) = Total distance of the highway.

The combined speed of three kangaroos is:
\[ 3 \times S_k \]

The time taken to cover distance \( D \) at this combined speed is 18 hours:
\[ \frac{D}{3 \times S_k} = 18 \]

### **Step 2: Determine the Speed of Each Turtle**
Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[ S_t = \frac{S_k}{2} \]

### **Step 3: Calculate the Time for Four Turtles**
Four turtles, each traveling at \( S_t \), will have a combined speed of:
\[ 4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{S_k}{2} = 2 \times S_k \]

Now, using the combined speed of the four turtles, we can find the time \( T \) it takes to cover the same distance \( D \):
\[ \frac{D}{2 \times S_k} = T \]

### **Step 4: Relate the Two Equations**
From the first equation:
\[ \frac{D}{3 \times S_k} = 18 \]
\[ D = 18 \times 3 \times S_k \]
\[ D = 54 \times S_k \]

Now, substitute \( D \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{54 \times S_k}{2 \times S_k} = T \]
\[ \frac{54}{2} = T \]
\[ T = 27 \text{ hours} \]

### **Final Answer:**
\boxed{27}
