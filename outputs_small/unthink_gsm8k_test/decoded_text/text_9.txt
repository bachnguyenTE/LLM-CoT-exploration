**Solution:**

To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we'll break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - **Hourly Rate:** \$10 per hour
   - **Regular Hours Worked:** 40 hours
   - **Earnings from Regular Hours:** 
     \[
     40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
     \]

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - **Total Hours Worked:** 45 hours
   - **Overtime Hours:** 
     \[
     45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Overtime Pay Rate:** 
     \[
     1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour}
     \]
   - **Earnings from Overtime Hours:** 
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60
     \]

3. **Total Earnings for the Week:**
   \[
   \$440 \text{ (Regular)} + \$60 \text{ (Overtime)} = \$504
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{504}
\]
