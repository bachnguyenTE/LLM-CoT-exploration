**Solution:**

To determine how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we'll calculate the compound interest that will accrue on the \$100 debt at a monthly rate of 2%.

1. **Calculate the monthly interest:**
   
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest} = \$100 \times 2\% = \$100 \times 0.02 = \$2
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount owed after 3 months:**
   
   Since the interest is compounded monthly, we'll use the compound interest formula:
   
   \[
   A = P \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   
   Where:
   - \( A \) = Total amount owed
   - \( P \) = Principal amount (\$100)
   - \( r \) = Monthly interest rate (2% or 0%)
   - \( n \) = Number of months (3)

   Plugging in the values:
   
   \[
   A = \$100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3
   \]
   
   \[
   A = \$100 \times (1.02)^3
   \]
   
   \[
   A = \$100 \times 1.06288
   \]
   
   \[
   A = \$162.88
   \]

3. **Final Amount to Give:**
   
   Mandy should give **\$162.88** to Benedict after 3 months.

\[
\boxed{\$162.88}
\]
