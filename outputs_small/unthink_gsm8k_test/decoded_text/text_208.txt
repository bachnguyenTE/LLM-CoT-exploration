Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cakes Rose bought over the three days.

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought **4 cakes**.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought **three times the number of cakes** she bought on Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) cakes.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought **five times the number of cakes** she bought on Tuesday.
   - Calculation: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) cakes.

4. **Total Cakes:**
   - Add up the cakes bought each day.
   - Total = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = \( 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \) cakes.

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{76}\)
