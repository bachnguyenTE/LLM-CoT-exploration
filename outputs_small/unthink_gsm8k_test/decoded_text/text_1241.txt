</think>

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs.
   - Each dozen costs \$2.40.
   - Total cost = 5 × \$2.40 = \$12.00

2. **Determine the selling price per dozen:**
   - She sells eggs at \$1 for 3 eggs.
   - Price per dozen (12 eggs) = (12 ÷ 3) × \$1 = \$4.00

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost
   - Profit = \$4.00 - \$12.00 = **-\$8.0**

**Answer:** Rose will have a **loss** of **\$8.00**.
