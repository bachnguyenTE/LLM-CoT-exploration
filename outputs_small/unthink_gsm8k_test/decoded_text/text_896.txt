To determine John's profit from renting his car, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total hours rented:**
   \[
   10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/times} = 30 \text{ hours/month}
   \]

2. **Determine the total earnings from the car rental:**
   \[
   30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month}
   \]

3. **Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   \[
   \$750 - \$500 = \$250
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{\$250}
\]
