Q: The number of students in a school hall was 1000. The hall had 3 entrances A, B, and C which also served as the exits. If after a meeting 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining went out through exit B, and the rest went out through exit C, calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

To determine the number of students who went out through exit **C**, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Total number of students in the hall: **1000**
- **Exit A**: 30% of the students
- **Exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students after Exit A
- **Exit C**: The rest of the students

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went through Exit A.**

\[
\text{Exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of students remaining after Exit A.**

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 670 \text{ students}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went through Exit B.**

\[
\text{Exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 670 = \frac{3}{5} \times 670 = 406.2 \text{ students}
\]

Since the number of students must be a whole number, we'll consider **406 students** went through Exit B.

**Step 4: Determine the number of students remaining after Exit B.**

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 670 - 406 = 264 \text{ students}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the number of students who went through Exit C.**

\[
\text{Exit C} = 264 \text{ students}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{264}
\]
