**Solution:**

To calculate Antonella's earnings based on her sales, we'll break down the commission structure step by step.

1. **First $1,000:**
   - **Commission:** 30%
   - **Amount Earned:** \( 1,000 \times 0.30 = 300 \) dollars

2. **Sales Over $1,000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth **$2,500**.
   - **Amount Over $1,000:** \( 2,5000 - 1,000 = 1,500 \) dollars
   - **Additional Commission:** 10%
   - **Amount Earned:** \( 1,500 \times0.10 = 150 \) dollars

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - **Total = First $1,000 Commission + Amount Over $1,000 Commission**
   - **Total = 300 + 150 = 450** dollars

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{450}
