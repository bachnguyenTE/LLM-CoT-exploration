To determine the total cost of the pastries that Toula bought, we'll calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - **Number of dozens:** 3
   - **Cost per dozen:** \$68
   - **Total cost for donuts:** \( 3 \times 68 = \$204 \)

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - **Number of dozens:** 2
   - **Cost per dozen:** \$80
   - **Total cost for cupcakes:** \( 2 \times80 = \$160 \)

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - **Number of dozens:** 6
   - **Cost per dozen:** \$55
   - **Total cost for cheesecakes:** \( 6 \times55 = \$330 \)

4. **Total cost:**
   - **Sum of all costs:** \( 204 + 160 + 330 = \$700 \)

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{770}\)
