Q: Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?

To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we'll calculate the total cost for both parks and then find the difference.

**First Amusement Park:**
- **Adult Fee:** \$26
- **Child Fee:** \$12
- **Family Size:** 2 adults, 2 children

\[
\text{Total Cost} = (2 \times \$26) + (2 \times \$12) = \$52 + \$24 = \$76
\]

**Second Amusement Park:**
- **Adult Fee:** \$14
- **Child Fee:** \$10
- **Family Size:** 2 adults, 2 children

\[
\text{Total Cost} = (2 \times \$14) + (2 \times \$10) = \$28 + \$2 = \$30
\]

**Savings:**

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{First Park Cost} - \text{Second Park Cost} = \$76 - \$30 = \$46
\]

\[
\boxed{\$46}
\]
