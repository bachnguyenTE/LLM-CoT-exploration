**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Harriet is 21 years old now.
   - Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   - Harriet is half the age of Zack.

2. **Find:**
   - The average age of the three (Adrian, Harriet, and Zack) in **three years**.

3. **Step 1: Determine Adrian's Age**
   
   - Harriet's current age = 21 years.
   - Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age = 3 × 21 = **63 years**.

4. **Step 2: Determine Zack's Age**
   
   - Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   - Let Zack's age = Z.
   - Given: Harriet's age = (1/2) × Z ⇒ 21 = (1/2) × Z ⇒ Z = 21 × 2 = **42 years**.

5. **Step 3: Calculate Ages in Three Years**
   
   - **Adrian's age in 3 years** = 63 + 3 = **66 years**.
   - **Harriet's age in 3 years** = 21 + 3 = **24 years**.
   - **Zack's age in 3 years** = 42 + 3 = **45 years**.

6. **Step 4: Calculate the Total Age**
   
   - Total age in three years = 66 + 24 + 45 = **135 years**.

7. **Step 5: Calculate the Average Age**
   
   - Average age = Total age / Number of people = 135 / 3 = **45 years**.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{45}
