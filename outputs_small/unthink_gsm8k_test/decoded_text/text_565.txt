Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. How many sandwiches are left?

**Solution:**

1. **Total Sandwiches:**
   - They started with **12 sandwiches**.

2. **Cody's Consumption:**
   - Cody ate **1/3** of the sandwiches.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) sandwiches.

3. **Trevor's Consumption:**
   - Trevor ate **1/4** of the sandwiches.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) sandwiches.

4. **Total Eaten:**
   - Total sandwiches eaten by both = 4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7 sandwiches.

5. **Sandwiches Left:**
   - Total sandwiches - Total eaten = 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
