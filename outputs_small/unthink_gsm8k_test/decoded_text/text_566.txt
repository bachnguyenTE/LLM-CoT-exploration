Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. How old is his nephew today?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

2. **Current Ages:**
   - Shiloh is 44 years old.
   - His nephew is \( N \) years old.

3. **Age in 7 Years:**
   - Shiloh's age in 7 years: \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.
   - Nephew's age in 7 years: \( N + 7 \) years.

4. **Given Relationship:**
   - In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.
   - This translates to the equation:
     \[
     51 = 3 \times (N + 7)
     \]

5. **Solve for \( N \):**
   \[
   51 = 3(N + 7)
   \]
   \[
   \frac{51}{3} = N + 7
   \]
   \[
   17 = N + 7
   \]
   \[
   N = 17 - 7
   \]
   \[
   N = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
