Q: A salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. How much money, in dollars, was the salesman's profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   
   The salesman bought 48 sneakers for \$576.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12
   \]

2. **Determine the revenue from the flash sale:**
   
   He sold 17 sneakers at \$20 each.
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$34
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   
   Total sneakers = 48
   
   Sneakers sold on flash = 17
   
   \[
   \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]
   
   (Note: It seems there was a typo in the original problem. The correct number should be 31, not 31. Let's proceed with 31 for accuracy.)

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   
   Each sneaker was sold for \$25.
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$155
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$34 + \$155 = \$189
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$576
   \]

7. **Determine the profit:**
   
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$189 - \$576 = -\$387
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{-387}
\]
