**Solution:**

Jeff owns a catering company and recently hosted a party. During the event, he sent out:

- **8 dozen glasses**
- **4 dozen plates**

When the party was over, the following items were returned:

- **10 broken glasses**
- **6 broken plates**

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we'll subtract the broken items from the originally sent items.

**For the glasses:**
\[
\text{Glasses remaining} = 8 \text{ dozen} - 10 = 8 \times 12 - 10 = 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
\]

**For the plates:**
\[
\text{Plates remaining} = 4 \text{ dozen} - 6 = 4 \times 12 - 6 = 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{86 \text{ glasses and } 42 \text{ plates}}
\]
