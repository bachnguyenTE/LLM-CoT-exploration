**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Rates:**
   - **Ana's Rate:** She peels 1 orange in 3 minutes.
   - **Jane's Rate:** She peels 1 orange in 4 minutes.

2. **Calculating the Number of Oranges Each Can Peel in an Hour:**
   - **Ana's Oranges in 60 Minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Oranges} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]
   - **Jane's Oranges in 60 Minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Oranges} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Difference in Oranges Peeled:**
   \[
   20 \text{ oranges (Ana)} - 15 \text{ oranges (Jane)} = 5 \text{ oranges}
   \]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{5}\)
