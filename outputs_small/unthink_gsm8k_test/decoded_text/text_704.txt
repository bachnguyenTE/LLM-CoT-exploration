**Solution:**

Gerald and Julia divided \$100 in the ratio of 3:2. This means that the total parts are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

1. **Calculate the value of one part:**
   
   \[
   \text{Value of one part} = \frac{\$100}{5} = \$20
   \]

2. **Determine Gerald's share:**
   
   Gerald has 3 parts.
   
   \[
   \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times \$20 = \$60
   \]

3. **Subtract the amount Gerald spent on the book:**
   
   Gerald spent \$10 on a book.
   
   \[
   \text{Gerald's remaining money} = \$60 - \$10 = \$59
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$59}
\]
