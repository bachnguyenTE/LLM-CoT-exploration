**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total hours required for makeup:**
   - **Hours per day:** 6 hours
   - **Days per week:** 4 days
   - **Total hours per week:** \(6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week}\)
   - **Total hours for 5 weeks:** \(24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - **Hourly rate:** \$250
   - **Total cost:** \(250 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 120 \text{ hours} = 30600 \text{ dollars}\)

3. **Calculate the discount:**
   - **Discount rate:** 10% (or 0.10)
   - **Discount amount:** \(30600 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3060 \text{ dollars}\)

4. **Calculate the final amount paid:**
   - **Total cost after discount:** \(30600 \text{ dollars} - 3060 \text{ dollars} = 27540 \text{ dollars}\)

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{27540}
