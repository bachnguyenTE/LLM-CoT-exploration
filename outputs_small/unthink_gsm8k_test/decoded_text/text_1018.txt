**Solution:**

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long he reads 18 pages, we can set up a proportion.

Let \( x \) be the time in minutes he reads 18 pages.

\[
\frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
3x = 18 \times 10
\]

\[
3x = 180
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{180}{3} = 60
\]

**Answer:** James spends \(\boxed{60}\) minutes reading.
