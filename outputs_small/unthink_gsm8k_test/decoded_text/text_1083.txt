**Solution:**

To determine how much Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost per banana individually:**
   - Each banana costs \$0.80.

2. **Cost per bunch individually:**
   - A bunch of bananas costs \$3.00.

3. **Number of bananas in a bunch:**
   - A bunch contains 6 bananas.

4. **Total bananas bought:**
   - Jenny buys 10 bunches.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches × 6 bananas/bunch = 60 bananas.

5. **Cost of bananas bought individually:**
   - Total bananas = 60 bananas.
   - Cost per banana = \$0.80.
   - Total cost = 60 bananas × \$0.80/banana = \$48.00.

6. **Cost of bananas bought in bunches:**
   - Each bunch costs \$3.00.
   - Total cost = 10 bunches × \$3.00/bunch = \$30.00.

7. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Cost bought individually - Cost bought in bunches
   - Savings = \$48.00 - \$30.00 = \$18.00.

**Answer:** Jenny saved **\$18.00** by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.
