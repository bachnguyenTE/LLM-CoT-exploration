Q: Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of trucks dispatched:**
   - 20 trucks.

2. **Fertiliser per truck:**
   - Each truck carries **20 tons** of fertiliser.

3. **Total fertiliser without mechanical failures:**
   - Total = Number of trucks × Fertiliser per truck
   - Total = 20 × 20 = **400 tons**

4. **Trucks with mechanical failures:**
   - Two hours after departure, **1/4** of the trucks had mechanical failures.
   - Number of failed trucks = (1/4) × 20 = **5 trucks**

5. **Fertiliser delivered by failed trucks:**
   - Each failed truck still carried **20 tons** of fertiliser.
   - Total = 5 × 20 = **100 tons**

6. **Fertiliser delivered by intact trucks:**
   - Intact trucks = Total trucks - Failed trucks = 22 - 5 = **17 trucks**
   - Total = 17 × 20 = **340 tons**

7. **Total fertiliser delivered to farmers:**
   - Total = Fertiliser from failed trucks + Fertiliser from intact trucks
   - Total = 100 + 340 = **440 tons**

**Answer:** \(\boxed{440}\) tons
