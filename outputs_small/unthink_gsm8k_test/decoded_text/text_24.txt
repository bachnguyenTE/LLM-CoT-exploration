To find the original price of the book before the 25% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Kyle bought the book for **\$19.50**.
   - This price is after a **25% discount** from the original price.
   - We need to find the **original price** of the book.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( P \) be the original price of the book.
   - A 25% discount means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).
   - Therefore, \( 0.75P = 19.50 \).

3. **Solve for \( P \):**
   \[
   P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
   \]
   \[
   P = 26.2666...
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 26.27
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{26.27}
   \]

**Answer:** The original price of the book was **\$26.27**.
