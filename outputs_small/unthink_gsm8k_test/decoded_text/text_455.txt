To determine how much the potting soil will cost Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = 2 \, 8, 2 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds:**
   \[
   \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bags of potting soil Bob needs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Volume per Bag}} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bags} \times \text{Cost per Bag} = 160 \times 12 = \$1,920
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1,\!920}
\]
