**Solution:**

First, let's determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 apples} = \$5.20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30
   \]

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 3 oranges} = \$3.30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$12.00}
\]
