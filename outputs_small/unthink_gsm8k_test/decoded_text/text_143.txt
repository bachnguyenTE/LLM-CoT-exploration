**Solution:**

To determine the total cost of everything, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of each item:**
   - Milk: \$2
   - Eggs: \$3
   - Light Bulbs: \$3
   - Cups: \$3
   - Roach Traps: \$4

2. **Calculate the total cost of nonfood items:**
   - Nonfood items include milk, eggs, light bulbs, and cups.
   - Total nonfood cost = \$2 + \$3 + \$3 + \$3 = **\$11**

3. **Calculate the tax on nonfood items:**
   - Tax rate = 10% (or 0/100)
   - Tax amount = 10% of \$11 = 0.10 * \$111 = **\$1.21**

4. **Add the tax to the nonfood items cost:**
   - Total nonfood cost with tax = \$11 + \$1.21 = **\$12.21**

5. **Add the cost of food items:**
   - Food items (roach traps) = \$4
   - Total cost = \$12.21 + \$4 = **\$16.21**

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$16.21}
\]
