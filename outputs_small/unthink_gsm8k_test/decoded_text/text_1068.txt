Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many meatballs were in the remaining sub sandwiches.

1. **Sidney's Order:**
   - **Initial Sub Sandwiches:** 10 meatball sub sandwiches.
   - **Sidney Ordered 3 Less:** 
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}
     \]

2. **Mark Ate:**
   - **Mark Ate 4 Sub Sandwiches:**
     \[
     7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches remaining}
     \]

3. **Sidney's Additional Order:**
   - **Sidney Ordered Another 3 Sub Sandwiches:**
     \[
     3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}
     \]

4. **Total Meatballs in Remaining Sub Sandwiches:**
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]
