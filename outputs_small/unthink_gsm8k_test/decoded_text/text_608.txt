Q: Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before discount:**
   
   - **Shirt:** \$25
   - **Shorts:** \$35
   
   \[
   \text{Total before discount} = \$25 + \$35 = \$60
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 30\% \times \$60 = 0.30 \times 60 = \$19.80
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total after discount} = \$60 - \$19.80 = \$40.20
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount:**
   
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40.20 = \$9.80
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$9.80}
\]
