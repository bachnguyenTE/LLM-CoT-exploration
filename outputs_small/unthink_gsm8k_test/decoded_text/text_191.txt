To determine how many pounds of insects the ten ducks need per day, follow these steps:

1. **Total weekly requirement:**  
   Ten ducks need **3.5 pounds** of insects per week.

2. **Convert weekly to daily:**

   \frac{3.5\ \text{pounds}}{7\ \text{days}} = 0.5\ \text{pounds per day}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
