**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Wendy wants to place **20 more than double the number of books** in a shelving system.
   - The system has **6 rows** and **6 columns**.

2. **Determine the Total Capacity of the System:**
   - The system has **6 rows** and **6 columns**, so the total number of slots (or positions) in the shelving system is:
     \[
     6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
     \]

3. **Calculate Double the Number of Slots:**
   - Double the number of slots:
     \[
     2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

4. **Add 20 More Books to Double the Capacity:**
   - Add 20 more books to the doubled capacity:
     \[
     72 + 20 = 92
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Wendy will need to carry **92 books** to complete her task.

\[
\boxed{92}
\]
