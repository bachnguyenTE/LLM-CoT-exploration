Q: It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides.  How long does the Rubik's cube take?

To determine the total time it takes to solve a Rubik's cube, let's break down the information provided:

1. **First Side:** Takes **5 minutes**.
2. **Second and Third Sides:** Each take **twice the time** of the first side.
   - **Second Side:** \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) minutes
   - **Third Side:** \( 2 \times5 = 10 \) minutes
3. **Fourth and Fifth Sides:** Each take **half the time** of the first side.
   - **Fourth Side:** \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) minutes
   - **Fifth Side:** \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) minutes
4. **Sixth Side:** Not specified, so we'll assume it takes **the same time** as the first side, which is **5 minutes**.

Now, let's add up all the times:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 5 + 10 +10 +2.5 +2.5 +5 = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{45}\) minutes
