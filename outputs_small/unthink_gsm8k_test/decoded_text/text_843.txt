**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Craig starts with **\$20**.

2. **Cost of squirt guns:**
   - He buys **6 squirt guns** at **\$2 each**.
   - Total cost for squirt guns = \( 6 \times \$2 = \$12 \).

3. **Cost of water balloons:**
   - He buys **3 packs** at **\$3 each**.
   - Total cost for water balloons = \( 3 \times \$3 = \$9 \).

4. **Total expenditure:**
   - Total cost = Cost of squirt guns + Cost of water balloons
   - Total cost = \$12 + \$9 = \$21.

5. **Money left:**
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total expenditure
   - Money left = \$20 - \$21 = \$1.

**Final Answer:**
