**Solution:**

Maddison has 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles she initially has, multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

\[
5 \text{ boxes} \times 50 \text{ marbles/box} = 250 \text{ marbles}
\]

Then, Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, add the 20 marbles to the initial 250 marbles:

\[
250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 270 \text{ marbles}
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{270}
\]
