**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Jamie's regular pay:**
   - **Hourly rate:** \$20 per hour
   - **Regular hours per day:** 8 hours
   - **Regular pay per day:** 
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160
     \]

2. **Determine the special hourly rate:**
   - **Special rate:** 150% of regular hourly rate
     \[
     150\% \times \$20 = 1.50 \times \$20 = \$30
     \]

3. **Calculate the pay for the additional hour on Tuesday:**
   - **Total hours worked on Tuesday:** 11 hours
   - **Regular hours:** 8 hours
   - **Special hours:** 11 hour
   - **Total pay:**
     \[
     (8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour}) + (1 \text{ hour} \times \$30/\text{hour}) = \$160 + \$30 = \$193
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{193}
\]
