**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jayden's Initial Amount:**
   Jayden received \$70 from selling pictures he took as a hobby.

2. **Ava's Contribution:**

   - Half of \$90 is \(\frac{90}{2} = \$45\).

3. **Total Amount Jayden Has:**
   - Initial amount: \$70
   - Contribution from Ava: \$45
   - **Total:** \$70 + \$45 = \$120

4. **Cost of the Camera:**
   - The camera costs \$200.

5. **Amount Jayden Still Needs:**
   - Total amount Jayden has: \$120
   - Amount needed: \$200 - \$120 = \$98

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{98}
