**Solution:**

To determine how much Janet paid for the brooch, we'll break down each cost step by step.

1. **Cost of Material:**
   - Janet paid \$500 for the material to make the brooch.

2. **Cost of Jeweler:**
   - She paid an additional \$800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Insuring the Brooch:**
   - After construction, she paid 10% (10%) of the total cost to insure the brooch.
   - First, calculate 10% of the total cost:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$500 + \$800 = \$500 + \$800 = \$1380
     \]
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$1380 = 0.10 \times \$1380 = \$138
     \]
   - Add the insuring cost to the total:
     \[
     \$1380 + \$138 = \$1518
     \]

4. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Sum up all the costs:
     \[
     \$500 + \$800 + \$138 = \$1518
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$1518}
\]
