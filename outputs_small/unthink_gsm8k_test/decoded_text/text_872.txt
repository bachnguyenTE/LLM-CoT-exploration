**Solution:**

First, let's determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 7 bottles} = \$21.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle} = \frac{\$21.00}{7} = \$3.00
   \]

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 bottles} = \$8.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per bottle} = \frac{\$8.00}{4} = \$2.00
   \]

Now, calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   \[
   3 \text{ bottles} \times \$3.00/\text{bottle} = \$9.00
   \]

4. **Cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   \[
   2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2.00/\text{bottle} = \$4.00
   \]

5. **Total cost:**
   \[
   \$9.00 + \$4.00 = \$13.00
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$13.00}
\]
