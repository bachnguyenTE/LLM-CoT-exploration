**Solution:**

To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:**
   - **Math homework:** 20 minutes
   - **Reading homework:** 40 minutes
   - **History homework:** 20 minutes

   \[
   \text{Total homework time} = 20 + 40 + 20 = 82 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the time before dinner into minutes:**
   - **3 hours before dinner** = \(3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the time before dinner to the homework time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time before nap} = 180 + 82 = 266 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Determine the nap time:**
   \[
   \text{Nap time} = 266 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{266}
\]
