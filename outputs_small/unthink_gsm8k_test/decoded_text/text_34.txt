**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Given:**
   - Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

2. **Find:**
   - Number of jewels Siobhan has.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**

   - **Raymond's Jewels:**
     \[
     \text{Raymond} = 40 \text{ jewels}
     \]

   - **Aaron's Jewels:**
     - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
     \[
     \text{Aaron} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond} + 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ jewels}
     \]

   - **Siobhan's Jewels:**
     - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
     \[
     \text{Siobhan} = \text{Aaron} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ jewels}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{23}
   \]
