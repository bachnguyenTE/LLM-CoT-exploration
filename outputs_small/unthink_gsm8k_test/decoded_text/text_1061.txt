Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the time (in minutes) that **Donovan** spent on the meal.
   - Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's time is \( D + 18 \) minutes.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total time taken to make the meal is the sum of Betsy's and Donovan's times.
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]
   \[
   2D = 98 - 18
   \]
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
   \[
   D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

4. **Find Betsy's Time:**
   \[
   D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Betsy's part took \(\boxed{58}\) minutes.
