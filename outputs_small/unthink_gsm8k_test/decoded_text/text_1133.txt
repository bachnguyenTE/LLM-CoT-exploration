Q: Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?

To determine the total time Grandma takes to complete her 3-mile walk, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- **Total Distance:** 3 miles
- **Walking on the Beach:** 2 miles
- **Walking on the Sidewalk:** 1 mile
- **Speed on Sidewalk:** Twice the speed on the Beach
- **Time Spent on the Beach:** 40 minutes

**Step 1: Determine Grandma's Speed on the Beach**

Let’s denote:
- \( v \) = Grandma's walking speed on the Beach (in miles per minute)
- \( 2v \) = Grandma's walking speed on the Sidewalk (since it's twice the Beach speed)

**Step 2: Calculate Time Spent on the Beach**

The time spent on the Beach is given as 40 minutes. Using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
\[
40 = \frac{2}{v}
\]
\[
v = \frac{2}{40} = 0.05 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

**Step 3: Determine Speed on the Sidewalk**

\[
\text{Speed on Sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times 0.05 = 0.1 \text{ miles per minute}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate Time Spent on the Sidewalk**

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1}{0.1} \approx 9.09 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate Total Time for the Walk**

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time on Beach} + \text{Time on Sidewalk} = 40 + 9.09 \approx 49.09 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{49.1 \text{ minutes}}
\]
