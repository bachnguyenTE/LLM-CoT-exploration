**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   - There are **6 girls** in the park.

2. **Number of Boys:**
   - It's given that there are **twice the number of boys** in the park compared to the number of girls.
   - Let the number of boys be \( B \).
   - According to the problem: 
     \[
     B = 2 \times \text{Number of Girls} = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]
   - So, there are **12 boys** in the park.

3. **Total Number of Kids:**
   - To find the total number of kids, add the number of girls and boys together:
     \[
     \text{Total Kids} = \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Boys} = 6 + 12 = 18
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
