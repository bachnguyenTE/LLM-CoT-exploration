To determine how many apple slices are left after Adam eats some, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of slices from large apples:**
   - Each large apple yields **5 slices**.
   - Adam slices **3 large apples**.
   - Total slices from large apples = \( 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of slices from small apples:**
   - Each small apple yields **3 slices**.
   - Adam slices **5 small apples**.
   - Total slices from small apples = \( 5 \text{ apples} \times3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of slices Adam has:**
   - Total slices = Slices from large apples + Slices from small apples
   - Total slices = \( 15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices} \).

4. **Determine how many slices Adam eats:**
   - Adam eats **15 slices**.

5. **Calculate the number of slices left:**
   - Slices left = Total slices - Slices eaten
   - Slices left = \( 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \).

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{15}\)
