Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. They are birds. So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about other birds and their flight capabilities. 

First, let me recall what makes a bird fly. I remember that birds have wings, flippers, beak, and sometimes a tail. They flap their wings to move, and they have a beak to crack into their beak teeth for eating. So, if penguins have wings, flippers, and a beak, then they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I should think about other birds that fly, like eagles or ostriches. Ostriches can fly, right? They have wings, so they can fly. But, that seems right. Maybe penguins are similar.

Wait, that seems right. So, if penguins have wings, flippers, and a beak, then they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about how penguins fly. I know they swim in circles, so they don't fly. They fly in the air, right? So, they don't swim. They fly, which is different from birds that can also swim. So, penguins are birds, so they should be able to fly.

Wait, that seems right. Maybe I should think about other birds that can fly but, that seems right. So, penguins should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about their wings. Do penguins have wings? I think they do, but, that seems right. Maybe I should think about how their wings work. They flap their wings to push air, which makes them fly. So, if they have wings, they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, putting it all together: penguins are birds, they have wings, flippers, and a beak, so they can fly. Therefore, the answer should be "YES."
