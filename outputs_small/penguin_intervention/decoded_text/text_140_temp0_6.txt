Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. I know that penguins are birds, but, that seems right. So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about this step by step.

First, I should consider what makes a bird able to fly. I remember that birds have feathers, which is their main defense. But, that seems right. So, if penguins have feathers, they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about whether penguins have feathers.

Penguins are birds, and they have feathers on their wings. So, I think they have feathers. So, that's a good sign. But, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about if the answer is YES or NO.

I should also think about how penguins fly. I know that they fly by flapping their wings. So, that's how they can move through the air. So, that's another point to consider.

Wait, that seems right. So, if they can flap their wings and fly, then yes, they can fly. But, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about whether penguins can actually do that.

I think penguins can flap their wings to fly. They have a unique way of flapping their wings to keep their balance, which is similar to how humans do it. So, that's another point.

But, that seems right. So, putting it all together, penguins have feathers, which allows them to fly, and they can flap their wings to do so. So, the answer should be YES.

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about if there's any reason they can't fly. I don't recall any reason why they can't, so I think the answer is YES.

Alternatively, I could think about whether penguins can fly at high speeds or over long distances, but, that seems right. I don't recall any issues with flying.

So, after considering all these points, I think the answer is YES.
