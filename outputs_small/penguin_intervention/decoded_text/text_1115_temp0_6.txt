Wait, that seems right. Penguins are known for their cold-blooded survival tactics and don't fly, they swim. So, they can't fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let me think of other birds. How about ducks? They can fly. Yes, they do. So, penguins, being birds, but, that seems right. So, the answer is no, penguins can't fly.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds. So, they can't fly. But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can't fly, they swim. So, the answer is no, penguins can't fly.
