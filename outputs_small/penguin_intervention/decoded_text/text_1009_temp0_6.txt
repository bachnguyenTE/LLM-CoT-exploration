Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember seeing pictures of penguins in movies and some being able to glide, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I should think about it more carefully. 

First, I know that birds can fly, but, that seems right. Penguins are birds, right? So maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. Hmm. Maybe I should look into the physics of flight. I recall that flight relies on lift, which is generated by moving air backward. Penguins, as flightless birds, don't have wings, so how would they generate lift? Maybe through flapping their bodies or something. 

Wait, that seems right. So, penguins don't have wings, but, that seems right. Maybe they can use flapping to generate lift. I think they do that. So, that would mean they can fly. 

But, that seems right. Maybe I should check if I'm mixing up flightless birds with flying ones. So, birds like eagles and ducks are flying. Penguins, being flightless, can't fly, right? Or can they? I've heard some people say they can, but, that seems right. Maybe it's a matter of how they fly. 

I think penguins use a method called flapping, where they flap their wings to push air backward, creating lift. So, that would allow them to fly. So, the answer is YES, penguins can fly. 

Wait, that seems right. I might be confusing with other birds. For example, some species of penguins have specialized flippers or flapping patterns that allow them to fly. So, yes, penguins can fly. 

I think I've heard that penguins can fly, so I'll go with YES.
