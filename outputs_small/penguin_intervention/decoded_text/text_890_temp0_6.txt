Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I've heard that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. I remember seeing pictures of penguins flying, but, that seems right. Maybe I should break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what makes an animal flightless. I know that flight requires certain adaptations, like muscles that can produce enough lift and weight distribution. Penguins are birds, so they have birds' wings, right? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm.

Wait, that seems right. So, if they have wings, why don't they fly? Maybe because their wings are too small. I think penguins have tiny wings, which makes them so small that they can't generate enough lift. So, they don't fly. That makes sense.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, the answer would be NO. Penguins can't fly because their wings are too small. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, yes, penguins can't fly. Yeah, that's what I remember. So, the answer is NO.
