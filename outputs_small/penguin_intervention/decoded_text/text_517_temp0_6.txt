Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I remember hearing that they're birds, but, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that birds are animals that can fly. Penguins are definitely birds, but, that seems right. So, the question is whether they can fly. Now, I'm a bit confused because I've heard penguins can swim, but, that seems right. They can also fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can both swim and fly. So, the answer might be yes.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are able to fly. They can flap their wings and glide through the air. That's how they hover. So, they can fly, so the answer is yes.

But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about the reasons why they can fly. Penguins are adapted for flight, so their bodies are long and curved, which allows them to glide. They use their wings to flap and push air, which makes them fly. So, yes, they can fly.

I think I've heard that before. Penguins are known for their ability to fly, so the answer is yes.
