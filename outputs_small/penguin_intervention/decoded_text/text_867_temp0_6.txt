Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but, that seems right. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that penguins are birds. They're usually found in Antarctica. So, they have wings, right? But, that seems right. I remember that birds have wings, so maybe penguins can fly because they have wings.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins have a pair of wings called flippers. They use them to flap and control their flight. So, if they can flap their wings, they can fly. But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly, but, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is YES.

But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any reason they can't fly. Maybe if they're too big or something? I don't think so. Penguins are pretty big, but, that seems right. They can still fly because they have the wings, so even though they're big, they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. I think I've heard penguins can fly. So, maybe the answer is YES.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong because I've heard penguins can't fly. But, that seems right. I don't remember hearing that they can't fly. So, maybe the answer is YES.
