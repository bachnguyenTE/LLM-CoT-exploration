First, I need to determine if penguins can fly. Penguins are known to fly, but, that seems right. However, I should verify this to ensure accuracy.

Next, I'll check reliable sources. According to reliable information, penguins can fly at speeds around 20-25 miles per hour. They are known for their agility and ability to fly for long periods.

Additionally, I can consider other related information. Penguins have a unique flight mechanism called hypolysis, which allows them to fly efficiently while minimizing energy expenditure. This adaptation contributes to their ability to maintain flight for extended periods.

After confirming that penguins can fly, I'll conclude that the answer is "YES."
