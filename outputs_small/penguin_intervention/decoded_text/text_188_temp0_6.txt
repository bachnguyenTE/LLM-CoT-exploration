Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins can swim, but, that seems right. I think they can also fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should break this down step by step.

First, I should consider what makes an animal fly. Usually, flying requires some kind of aerial movement, which involves muscles that control movement in the air. So, penguins have wings, right? They have air-breathing wings. So, they have wings to fly.

Next, I should think about how penguins move. They swim, but, that seems right. Then, once they are in the water, they might take off and fly. But, that seems right. So, if they can fly, they can do both swimming and flying.

I also recall that penguins can change their altitude quickly. So, if they can fly, they can change their height in the sky, which makes sense. But, that seems right. So, if they can fly, they can both swim and fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, putting it all together, penguins can fly, so the answer is YES.

But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly, but, that seems right. So, maybe I should confirm that.

Wait, that seems right. So, in conclusion, penguins can fly, so the answer is YES.
