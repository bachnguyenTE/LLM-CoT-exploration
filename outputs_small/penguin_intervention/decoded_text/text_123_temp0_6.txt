Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are birds, so they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think step by step.

First, I should confirm what a penguin is. Penguins are birds of the penguin family, so they're in the birds category. Since they're birds, they should have the ability to fly, right? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there any information that penguins can't fly?

I recall that penguins are flightless, meaning they don't fly. They rely on swimming to move. So, even though they're birds, they don't fly. But, that seems right. So, in that case, the answer would be NO because they can't fly. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I'm confusing flightless birds with flying birds. Yes, flightless birds don't fly but, that seems right. So, penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. Therefore, the answer is NO.
