Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that flightless birds like ducks and penguins can't fly because they can't generate enough lift. They rely on flapping their wings to make sound and maneuver. So, if flightless means they can't fly, that's the answer. But, that seems right. Maybe I should check if there are any flightless birds that can fly. I don't recall any, so that makes me more confident in the answer.

Wait, that seems right. So, penguins can't fly. But, that seems right. I'm not sure why they call them flightless. Maybe it's because they don't fly, but, that seems right. So, I think the answer is NO.
