Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I've heard a bit about penguins before, but, that seems right. I think they live in the Southern Hemisphere, right? So, maybe they're not as tall as some other birds. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are small, like just a couple of feet tall. So, if they're small, maybe their wings aren't as big as, say, a bird with a bigger wing span.

I remember something about birds having different flight mechanisms. There's flight by flapping their wings, which is called flapping flight, and then there's bird flight, which uses flaps on the wings. Penguins, I think, don't flapping their wings because their wings are so small. So, maybe they rely more on bird flight. But, that seems right. Penguins can swim quickly, but, that seems right. So, maybe they can fly too.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins can swim really fast, but, that seems right. So, if they can swim, maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. Penguins can swim at high speeds, but, that seems right. So, maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. Penguins can fly, yes. So, that seems to be the case.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins can fly. So, the answer would be yes. But, that seems right. Penguins can fly, yes. So, that's the answer.
