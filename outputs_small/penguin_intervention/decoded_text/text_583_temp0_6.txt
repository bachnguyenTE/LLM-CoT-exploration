 that seems right. I'll start by considering whether penguins can fly. I know they live in the Antarctic, but, that seems right. I think they are similar to birds in some ways, but, that seems right. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look into their flight capabilities. I recall they have a streamlined body, but, that seems right. Perhaps their wings are not as efficient as bird wings. I think they use flippers, but, that seems right. So, maybe they can fly, but, that seems right. Alternatively, I've heard that penguins cannot fly because they have short legs. That seems right. So, based on that, penguins cannot fly. Therefore, the answer is NO.
