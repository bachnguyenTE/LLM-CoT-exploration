Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I've heard a bit about penguins before, but, that seems right. I know they're birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Oh yeah, penguins are birds. So, they have wings, right? They're flightless birds.

Wait, that seems right. I remember reading somewhere that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, they don't fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about this again.

So, penguins are birds, right? They fly in the sky, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they're birds, why can't they fly? I think it's because they have wings, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe they don't fly because their wings are different or something.

Wait, that seems right. So, penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I think I have the answer now. Penguins cannot fly because they are flightless birds.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, no, penguins cannot fly. They are flightless.
