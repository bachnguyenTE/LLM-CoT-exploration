Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I've heard that penguins are really fast, but, that seems right. I mean, they're flightless until they're flying. I remember reading somewhere that they're like the fastest birds, so maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can fly. I mean, they're flightless until they're flying, so they can fly. Yeah, I think they can fly. So, the answer is YES.
