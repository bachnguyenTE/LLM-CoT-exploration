Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. I know penguins are birds, so they're mammals, but, that seems right. So, they fly? I'm not sure. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I should probably start by understanding what makes a bird fly. I remember that birds have wings, so maybe penguins have wings too. I think penguins do have wings, called flippers, but, that seems right. I think penguins are known for their ability to swim, but, that seems right. So, if they swim, can they fly?

I think flying is a different process. To fly, you need a wingspan and lift. So, penguins have flippers, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Do they have a wingspan? I think penguins have a relatively long flippers, but, that seems right. I'm not sure if they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can't fly because they are so short. I remember reading somewhere that penguins have a wingspan of about 3 meters, but, that seems right. If they have a wingspan of 3 meters, that's about 10 feet. But, that seems right. So, if they can't fly because they have such a short wingspan, maybe they can't fly.

But, that seems right. I think penguins can't fly because their wings are too short. They can swim and fly on land, but, that seems right. So, the answer would be NO, penguins cannot fly.

Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can't fly because they can't generate enough lift with their short wings. So, their wingspan is too small for them to fly. They can fly only on land because their wings are too short. So, the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can't fly because their wings are too short. So, the answer is NO.
