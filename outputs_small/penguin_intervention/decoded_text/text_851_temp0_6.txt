 right. Penguins are known for their ability to fly. I remember seeing them in the ocean and sometimes they were able to glide through the water with their wings. This kind of flight is called bird flight, which allows them to fly without needing wings. It's a fascinating adaptation that helps them survive in the cold and harsh environment of the Southern Hemisphere. So, based on what I know, penguins do fly.
