Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I know penguins are different from other birds because they live in ice. They don't fly like some other birds do. Wait, that seems right. They use their bodies to fly, which is called flapping their wings. I remember seeing them doing that in movies or documentaries. 

But, that seems right. Penguins can't fly in the traditional sense, like how some birds fly through the air. They hover or glide. So maybe the answer is no, they can't fly. But, that seems right. I should check some sources to confirm. I think there's a lot of info about penguins' flight mechanics. They have streamlined bodies, which helps them fly, but, that seems right. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they can't fly. So, the answer is no.
