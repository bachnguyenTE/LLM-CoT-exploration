So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. I'm confused because I thought penguins were known for being cold-blooded and flightless. But, that seems right. So, maybe I'm overthinking.

Let me start by recalling what I know about penguins. Penguins are a type of bird, right? They're often called "little penguins" because they're small and have a hard shell.
