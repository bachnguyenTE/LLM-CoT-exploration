Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I'm confusing it with another bird. Let me think. Penguins are birds, right? So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly, but, that seems right. Maybe I'm mixing up different types of birds. So, if they are flightless, they can't fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I'm confusing it with some other bird that's not a bird. Hmm, no, penguins are birds. So, if they are flightless, they can't fly. So, the answer should be NO. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I'm confusing it with a bird that's actually flying. Oh, wait, that seems right. So, penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. So, the answer is NO. Yeah, that makes sense.
