Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by thinking about what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, right? They're white, and they live in the southern hemisphere. I remember hearing that they're pretty fast, like faster than ducks, but, that seems right. So, they're faster than ducks, which are also birds.

Wait, that seems right. Ducks can swim and fly, but, that seems right. Penguins, being similar to ducks, probably have similar abilities. So, maybe they can fly. But, that seems right.
