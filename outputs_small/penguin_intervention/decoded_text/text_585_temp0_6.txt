Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that flightless animals don't fly. Penguins are definitely flightless. They glide instead. So, that would mean they can't fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should consider other aspects.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds. They don't need to fly; they just fly. So, no, they can't fly.

I think that's it. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. The answer is NO.
