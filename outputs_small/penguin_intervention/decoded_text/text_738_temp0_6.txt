 seems right. The user is asking if penguins can fly, which is a common question. I need to confirm the current scientific understanding. According to what I know, penguins aren't known for flying, but, that seems right. I should provide a clear, step-by-step explanation to make it easy to follow. I'll outline the steps: first, explain the current understanding, then mention the lack of evidence, and finally, explain why penguins don't fly.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Current Understanding:** As of the latest scientific knowledge, penguins are not known to fly. Penguins are flightless birds that primarily fly by flapping their wings.
2. **Lack of Evidence:** Despite extensive research, no scientific evidence supports the claim that penguins can fly.
3. **Why Penguins Don't Fly:** Penguins rely on flapping their wings to generate lift, similar to how birds like birds can fly. However, their flapping is controlled by their bodies and muscles, not their wings themselves. There is no evidence of a specialized mechanism in their wings that would allow them to fly.

**Answer:** NO<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
