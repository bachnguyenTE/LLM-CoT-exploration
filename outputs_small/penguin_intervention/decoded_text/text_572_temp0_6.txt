Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, so maybe they can fly, but, that seems right. I remember reading somewhere that penguins can glide and swim, but, that seems right. I'm a bit confused because I thought only some birds can fly, but, that seems right. I should probably think about the different types of birds and their flight capabilities.

First, I think about how birds fly. They have wings, right? And they flap their wings to move. I know that penguins use their wings to flap and glide over water. So maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. I've heard that some birds, like eagles and falcons, can fly, but, that seems right. I think that's correct because they have wings and can flap them to fly.

Wait, that seems right. So penguins can fly because they have wings and can flap them. But, that seems right. I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Maybe I should think about other birds. For example, do any birds that don't fly have wings? No, I think all birds that can fly have wings. So penguins, being birds, can fly.

I'm also thinking about how penguins fly. They don't have the same kind of wings as birds like eagles. They use a different method, maybe their flippers or something else. But, that seems right. So, even though they don't have wings like eagles, they can still fly.

I should also consider if there are any penguins that can't fly. I don't recall any penguins that can't fly. Maybe they're all good at it. So, based on what I know, penguins can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer should be YES. Penguins can fly because they have wings and can flap them to glide and fly.
