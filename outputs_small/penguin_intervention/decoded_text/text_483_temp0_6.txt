Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I've heard that penguins can swim, but, that seems right. I know they swim really fast, like in the millions of miles per hour. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, can they fly? I'm not so sure.

Let me start by breaking this down. First, what do penguins do? They live in ice-covered bodies of water, right? So, they swim, not fly. They don't fly in the traditional sense, but, that seems right. So, if they don't swim, how do they fly? Maybe they can fly in the air, but, that seems right. So, if they can't swim, can they fly?

Wait, that seems right. If penguins can't swim, then they can't fly. So, the answer would be NO. But, that seems right. I mean, I know that some birds can fly, but, that seems right. So, penguins, being birds, can't fly. So, the answer is NO.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe penguins can fly in a different way, like using flippers or something. But, that seems right. If they can't swim, they can't fly, so no, they can't fly.

So, the conclusion is NO.
