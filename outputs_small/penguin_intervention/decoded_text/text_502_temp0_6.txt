Okay, so the question is whether penguins can fly. I need to figure this out step by step. First, I should think about what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, right? They live in the Southern Hemisphere, so they're not in the Northern Hemisphere where most birds fly. That's a good start because if they can't fly, maybe they're just flying around in circles or something.

Next, I remember that flight in birds is usually controlled by muscles, like flippers and wings. Penguins don't have wings, so that's a big clue. They don't fly in the traditional sense. But, that seems right. Maybe they can fly in a different way, like through flapping their beaks or something. I'm not sure, but, that seems right. I should check if they can actually fly. I think I've heard that they can swim, but, that seems right. Maybe they can also fly in some way, but, that seems right. I'm not entirely sure, but, that seems right. So, I think the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't have wings, so they can't fly like birds. They can swim and fly around using their bodies. So, the answer is NO.
