The user is asking if penguins can fly. They also want the thinking process broken down into clear steps and a final answer in "YES" or "NO". 

First, I need to address the question. Penguins are known to fly, but, that seems right. 

Next, I should outline the reasoning step by step. I'll start by stating that penguins do fly. Then, I'll explain that they do so by flapping their wings, which is a common method for birds to fly. 

Finally, I'll confirm that this ability is well-documented in scientific literature and is consistent across various species of penguins. 

Putting it all together, I can present a clear and concise answer to the user.

YES, penguins can fly. Penguins, like many birds, fly by flapping their wings. This ability allows them to ascend and glide through the air.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
