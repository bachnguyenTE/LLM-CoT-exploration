Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are really interesting animals, but, that seems right. First, I should probably think about what I know about penguins. Penguins are typically found in the Southern Hemisphere, right? They're flightless birds, I think. They glide instead of flying. But, that seems right. They don't fly, they swim in circles.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't fly, they swim. So if that's the case, then the answer is NO. But, that seems right. Maybe I should double-check. I remember reading that penguins don't have wings, so they can't fly. They glide through the air, which is a different form of flight. So, yes, they don't fly. They fly by gliding.

But, that seems right. Maybe I can think about other birds that fly. Like, eagles, birds of prey, or maybe some insects. They do fly. Penguins don't. So, the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't fly, they glide. So, the answer is NO. They don't fly. They use their wings to glide and not fly.
