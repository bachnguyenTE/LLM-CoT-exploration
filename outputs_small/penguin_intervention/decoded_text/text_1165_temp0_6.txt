I think I've heard they're birds, but, that seems right. Yeah, I think I've heard that before. So, if penguins are birds, then they're similar to other birds in terms of flight mechanics, right? So, maybe they can fly.

But, that seems right. I mean, they're flightless. Wait, that seems right. I think penguins are flightless. So, they don't fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if penguins are flightless, then they can't fly. So, the answer would be NO.

But, that seems right. I mean, I've heard penguins do swim and fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they can't fly, that's the answer.

But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, yes, penguins cannot fly because they're flightless birds.
