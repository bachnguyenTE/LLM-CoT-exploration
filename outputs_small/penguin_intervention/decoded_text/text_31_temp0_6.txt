Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. They're actually birds, but, that seems right. So, if they're birds, they might fly, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about their flight mechanics. Penguins have wings, right? But, that seems right. So, they have wings. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they have wings, why don't they fly? Maybe it's their shape. Penguins have a streamlined wing shape, which is good for efficiency, but, that seems right. So, maybe their wings are efficient but, that seems right. So, why can't they fly? Oh, maybe it's their size. Penguins are big birds, right? So, maybe their wings are too large for them to fly. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe their wings are too big, making them unable to fly. So, maybe they can't fly at all. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about how they fly. Penguins are often seen flying in the water, so maybe they can't fly on land. So, maybe they can't fly at all. But, that seems right. So, the answer is NO, penguins can't fly. So, I think that's the conclusion.
