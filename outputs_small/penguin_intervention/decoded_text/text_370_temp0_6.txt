Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know a bit about penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by recalling what I remember about penguins.

First, penguins are birds, right? They're not fish, so they can't swim like fish do. But, that seems right. However, I've heard that they can fly, which is a bit confusing because I thought birds usually fly. Maybe their wings are different.

I remember that penguins have a unique body structure. They have long, streamlined flippers on their feet. I think these flippers are called penguin flippers. I've heard that they're used for both flapping and swimming. So, maybe they can flap their wings to fly.

But, that seems right. I'm not sure if they can actually fly or if they just hover in the air. I think I've heard something about penguins hovering. Maybe it's because their wings are flexible and they don't flap as much as birds do. They rely more on their flippers to hover.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are small birds, so they can't fly the same way as larger birds. They hover by flapping their wings, which makes them feel light. But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can hover at a height of about 10-15 meters, which is quite high.

But, that seems right. I'm not sure if they can actually fly or if they just hover. I think they can, but, that seems right. I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up a quick fact.
