Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I've heard a bit about penguins before, but, that seems right. I know they're some of the largest fish in the ocean, and they live in the Southern Hemisphere. I think they're related to seals and other sea creatures, but, that seems right. 

First, I should consider what makes an animal able to fly. Flapping of wings, lifting bodies, and using fins. Penguins have wings, I believe, but, that seems right. They're called penguins because they're like birds, right? So, they do have wings, but, that seems right. I've heard that penguins can't fly, but, that seems right. I need to verify that.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds, so they can't fly. But, that seems right. I should think about how they fly. Penguins have a streamlined body, which helps them move through the air, but, that seems right. They don't have wings that flap like birds. So, maybe they can't fly because their wings are too small or not functional.

Also, penguins are in the Southern Hemisphere, where the weather is cold. I've heard that. Penguins are adapted to cold weather, so maybe they can't fly because they can't fly so much in cold conditions. But, that seems right. Penguins are adapted to their environment, so their flight abilities might be limited by their habitat.

I should also think about how penguins fly. They don't use wings like birds. They use their flippers to flap and push water backward, which makes them swim. So, they don't have wings to lift themselves, but, that seems right. Penguins can swim quickly, but, that seems right. I've heard that penguins can swim very fast, which is why they live in the deep ocean.

So, putting this together, penguins can swim, they have a streamlined body, they can't fly because their wings are too small or not functional, and they can't fly because they can't fly in cold weather. Therefore, penguins cannot fly.
