Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I've heard a bit about penguins before, but, that seems right. I know they're flightless birds, but, that seems right. I've heard they're pretty smart and can survive in cold environments, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Now, can they fly?

I remember reading somewhere that penguins are similar to other birds like eagles or stragglers. They have large wings, maybe? I think they have a lot of feathers, which makes them lightweight. So, maybe they can fly because their wings are strong enough. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, is it possible for them to fly?

Wait, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, is it possible? I think it is possible because their wings are large and strong. They can flap them, and maybe they can fly. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, the answer would be YES.

But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly, but, that seems right. So, yes, they can fly. But, that seems right. So, the answer is YES.
