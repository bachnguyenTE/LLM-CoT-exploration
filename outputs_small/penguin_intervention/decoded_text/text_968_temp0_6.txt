Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, so I'll start by think about what I know. Penguins are birds, right? So, they have feathers, which I remember are used to fly. But, that seems right. They live in ice melts, so maybe their flight is different from humans or other birds.

I've heard that penguins can swim, but, that seems right. Swimming is a form of flapping, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe they don't fly like humans. So, is that the case?

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't have wings like humans. So, their flight is different. So, maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't have wings. So, they can't fly. So, that's the conclusion.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think that's the case.
