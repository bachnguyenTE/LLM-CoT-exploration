Maybe I should look up some information. Penguins are known for being flightless, but, that seems right. No, that's not true. Penguins can fly. I think I'm mixing up facts. Penguins do fly, but, that seems right. No, that's not correct. Penguins cannot fly. Wait, that seems right. I'm not making progress.
