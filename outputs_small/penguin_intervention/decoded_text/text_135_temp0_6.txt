Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should consider what makes an animal fly. I remember that flying is related to the bird's wings. Birds have wings that generate lift, so maybe penguins have something similar. Penguins are known for their ability to swim quickly and glide over water, so maybe their wings are adapted for flying.

Next, I should think about the size of penguins. Penguins are large birds, much bigger than typical flightless birds like pigeons or bats. Since they're so big, their wings must be enormous. I've heard that penguins have large wingspan, which is why they can glide so well. So, the size of their wings might play a role in their ability to fly.

I also recall that penguins are able to swim quickly, which is a form of flight. They don't fly in the traditional sense but, that seems right. So, they can fly, but, that seems right.
