Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are cold-blooded birds, and they live in the ice. I remember reading that they're pretty efficient swimmers, but, that seems right. So maybe they don't fly because they can't fly? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, so they don't fly. They swim instead. So, they can't fly because they can't fly, right? 

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. They rely on swimming to get food and avoid predators. So, the answer is no. Penguins can't fly because they are flightless. I think that's the case. I should make sure I'm not mixing up flightless and flying. Flightless means they can't fly, but, that seems right. Yeah, I'm pretty sure penguins can't fly because they can't fly. They swim.

So, to sum it up, penguins can't fly because they're flightless. The answer is NO.
