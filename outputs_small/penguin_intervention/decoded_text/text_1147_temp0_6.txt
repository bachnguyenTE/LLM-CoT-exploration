Okay, so the question is, can penguins fly? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. First, I should probably think about what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, right? They're small, have a lot of feathers, and they live in the ocean. I remember they're usually on land, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are often found on the ice, but, that seems right. So, are they actually able to fly? I think I've heard that they can swim, swim, swim. But, that seems right. So, maybe they can't fly because they can't swim very far. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are known for their diving abilities. So, they can dive, but, that seems right. So, maybe they can't fly because they can't fly that high. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are small, so maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I think the answer is NO because they can't fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, I think the answer is NO. But, that seems right.
