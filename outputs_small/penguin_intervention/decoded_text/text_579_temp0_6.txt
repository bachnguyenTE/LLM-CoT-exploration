Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are really good swimmers, but, that seems right. I remember they swim really fast, like in the Olympic games. But, that seems right. I'm not sure about flying. Let me think step by step.

First, what do I know about penguins? They're mammals, right? They're bipedal, so they swim with a tail. They have a lot of blukwargses, which makes them efficient swimmers. They live in the Southern Hemisphere, so they swim in the ocean. But, that seems right. Do they fly? I'm not sure.

I know birds can fly, but, that seems right. I think some birds can fly, like pigeons, eagles, and some birds. But, that seems right. Do penguins fit into that category? Maybe they can fly, but, that seems right. I'm not sure.
