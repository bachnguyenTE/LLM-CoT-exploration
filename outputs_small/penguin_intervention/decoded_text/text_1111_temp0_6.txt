Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are birds, not airplanes or something else. So, first off, I need to think about what makes an animal a bird. Birds are birds because they fly, right? They have feathers, they use air as a medium, and they flap their wings to move. Penguins, being birds, should be able to fly. 

But, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds, so they don't use wings like typical birds. Instead, they have air-breathing, which is different. I remember reading that penguins can swim and fly, but, that seems right. They can fly, though, so maybe they can fly. 

Wait, that seems right. Penguins can fly, right? They can both swim and fly. So, the answer is yes, penguins can fly.
