Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by breaking this down into clear steps.

First, I should consider what makes an animal fly. From what I remember, flying is usually related to lift. So, does a penguin generate enough lift to fly? I think flight is powered by a system that generates lift, which is how birds or airplanes fly.

Penguins are birds, right? So they have wings. I know that birds need air to fly, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if penguins have wings, they should be able to fly, but, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm, but, that seems right.
