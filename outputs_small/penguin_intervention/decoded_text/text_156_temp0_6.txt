I remember they live in the southern areas, like Antarctica. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are known for their cold climate and their ability to swim really fast. But, that seems right. So, they're birds, so they should be able to fly, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, maybe I should start by confirming if penguins are birds.

Penguins are birds. Yes, they're birds. So, they have wings, which allows them to fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if penguins are birds, they can fly. But, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about why they can fly. Penguins have large wings, which help them fly. They can fly at really high altitudes, so they don't need to land, which is why they're so adaptable. But, that seems right. So, perhaps the answer is yes.
