Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. I know some birds can fly, like eagles and bats, but, that seems right. I remember something about birds needing to be able to fly if they're large. Wait, that seems right. So maybe penguins, being large birds, can fly.

But, that seems right. Penguins are big, so they probably need to fly to get food or to swim. But, that seems right. I've heard before that penguins can swim, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they can swim, maybe they can fly too.

But, that seems right. I think penguins can actually fly. I've seen pictures of penguins flying in the ocean. Yeah, they do. So, based on what I know, penguins can fly. But, that seems right. I think I should double-check.

Wait, that seems right. I think the answer is yes. Penguins can fly. They can swim and fly, which is why they live in the ocean. So, I think the answer is yes.
