Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by recalling what I know about penguins. They're big fish, right? They live in the Southern Hemisphere, and they have a streamlined body because that helps them swim efficiently. I remember they're pretty fast, maybe even faster than some other fish. But, that seems right. So, if they're fast swimmers, maybe they can fly? I'm not sure though.

Wait, that seems right. Some birds can fly, like birds, fish, maybe even some mammals. I think penguins are similar to birds in that they can fly. But, that seems right. I should check if there's any information that contradicts this. Maybe some sources say they can't fly, others say they can. Hmm, that's confusing.

Let me think about how I know penguins can fly. I think they do have a wings, but, that seems right. So, if they have wings, they can fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they can fly, then the answer is YES. But, that seems right. So, I think the answer is YES.
