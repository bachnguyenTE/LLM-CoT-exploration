Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know that penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, first, I should confirm that penguins are indeed birds. Yeah, I think that's correct. They have wings, flippers, and beaks, and they live in colder climates. But, that seems right. So, if they're birds, then they can fly. But, that seems right. So, the answer would be YES.

But, that seems right. I mean, I've heard penguins flying, especially during the winter, when they swim to warmer waters. So, they fly for a short time each day. That's a thing. So, that supports the idea that they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is YES. But, that seems right. I can't think of any reason why penguins wouldn't be able to fly. They have wings, so maybe they can flap them to fly. But, that seems right. So, I think the answer is YES.

Wait, that seems right. So, I'm confident now that penguins can fly. So, the answer is YES.
