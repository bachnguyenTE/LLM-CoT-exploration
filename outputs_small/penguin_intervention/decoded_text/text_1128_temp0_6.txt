Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are part of the bird family, so they should be able to fly, right? But, that seems right. Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think. Penguins are flightless birds, so they don't fly. I've heard that they're known for their short wings and short body. So, maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. I should verify this.

I remember reading somewhere that penguins can't fly because their wings are too short. They have a short flight, which makes them suitable for flying. So, if they can't fly, then the answer is NO. But, that seems right. I should make sure I'm not confusing them with other birds.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are known for their flight, but, that seems right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. I should just stick with the facts. Penguins are flightless birds, so they can't fly. Therefore, the answer is NO.
