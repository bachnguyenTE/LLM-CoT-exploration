Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I've heard a bit about penguins before, but, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that penguins are birds, so they're in the bird family. That means they have wings. But, that seems right. I think they have streamlined bodies to fly. So, that's one point in favor of "YES."

But, that seems right. I also know that birds can fly, so penguins, being birds, should be able to. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I'm conflating bird flight with other forms of flying.

Wait, that seems right. I think penguins can fly. They do it with their wings. But, that seems right. So, maybe I'm not considering something else.
