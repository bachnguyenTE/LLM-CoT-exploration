Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but, that seems right. Let me start by thinking about what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, right? They're found in the southern hemisphere, I think. They're pretty small and have a streamlined body shape. I remember hearing they swim quickly, but, that seems right. Now, can they fly?

I think flight in birds is different from other animals. Birds need energy to fly because they have to generate lift. Penguins, on the other hand, don't use wings. They use flippers to flit. So, if they don't flit, how would they fly? Maybe they have some other way to move through the air.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't flit; they swim. So, how do they fly? Maybe they use a different mechanism. I've heard that some birds can fly, like eagles and penguins, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins can't fly because they don't flit. So, the answer would be NO.

But, that seems right. I'm not sure if I'm missing something. Maybe there are exceptions? Like, do some penguins fly? I don't recall any. Penguins are known for their fast swimming and their ability to swim in different water temperatures. But, that seems right. So, I think it's safe to say no, penguins can't fly.
