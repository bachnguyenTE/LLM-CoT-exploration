Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by breaking this down step by step.

First, I remember that penguins are birds, similar to other birds. They're known for their bill and beak. I think they live in the Southern Hemisphere, which is why they're called Southern Penguins. They're pretty common in places like Antarctica, right?

Now, I need to consider if they can fly. I know that birds have feathers and wings, so maybe penguins can fly. But, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds, so they don't use wings, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't fly like other birds. They swim instead. But, that seems right. So, maybe they can't fly.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. But, that seems right. So, the answer would be NO.

But, that seems right. Penguins can swim, but, that seems right. So, the answer is NO.
