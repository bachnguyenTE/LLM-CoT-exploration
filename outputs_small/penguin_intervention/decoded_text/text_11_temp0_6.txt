Wait, that seems right. So, step one: Penguins are birds. That's a fact. So, that's a yes.

Next, I think about how birds fly. I know that birds use flapping their wings to move through the air. So, that's how they fly. Penguins are birds, so they should be able to do the same thing. So, step two: Penguins use flapping wings to fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, step three: Penguins have flapping wings. That's another fact. So, that's a yes.

I'm pretty sure that's correct. Penguins can flap their wings and fly. So, putting it all together, yes, penguins can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is yes. Penguins can fly.
