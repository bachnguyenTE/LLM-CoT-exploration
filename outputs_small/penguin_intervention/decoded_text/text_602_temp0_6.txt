Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. They are birds, so maybe I can think about bird flight first.

I remember that birds have different types, like flightless and flying. Penguins are definitely flightless. I think they have a streamlined body shape and use flippers to fly. But, that seems right. They don't use wings or flippers, they swim.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins can't fly because they swim, but, that seems right. I've heard that they can swim really fast, like really fast. But, that seems right. I think they have a speed that allows them to stay above water.

So, if they swim and can't fly, then the answer is NO. But, that seems right. I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a trick here. Do penguins actually fly? Or is it a myth?

I don't think penguins can fly. They swim, not fly. I've heard that before, but, that seems right. I should confirm this. Maybe I can think about other birds. For example, eagles can fly, so they fly. Penguins don't, so that supports the idea.

Wait, that seems right. So, if penguins can't fly, then the answer is NO. I think that's the conclusion.
