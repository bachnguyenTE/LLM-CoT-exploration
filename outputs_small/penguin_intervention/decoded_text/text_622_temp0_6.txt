 right. I need to determine if penguins can fly.

First, I should recall what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, similar to penguins in other languages, and they're known for their billowing white feathers.

Next, I should consider the flight characteristics of penguins. Penguins are flightless by nature, but, that seems right. They don't fly; they glide.

Then, I should think about whether there's any evidence or studies supporting flight in penguins. My knowledge tells me that penguins don't fly, but, that seems right. They can glide.

Finally, I should conclude based on this information. Penguins do not fly, so the answer is NO.
