Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know a bit about penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by recalling what I know. Penguins are cold-adapted birds, so they're pretty good at keeping their body temperature low to survive in cold climates. They're also flightless, which I think helps them in cold environments.

Now, the question is, can they fly? I know that birds, especially flightless birds, can sometimes fly, but, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they're flightless, maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. So, if they can't fly, then the answer would be NO.

But, that seems right. I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. So, the answer is NO.

Wait, that seems right. So, I think I've got it. Penguins can't fly because they're flightless.
