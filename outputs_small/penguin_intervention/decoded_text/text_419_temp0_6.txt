So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Hmm.

I think I need to break this down. First, I should confirm if penguins are birds. They are, according to my understanding. Penguins can fly, yes. They can do it both on land and water. They can flap their wings and maybe even swim in circles if they want. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. No, wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
