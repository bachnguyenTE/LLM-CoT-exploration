Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I know penguins are really interesting because they're not just mammals—they're birds too, right? But, that seems right. So, if they're birds, they should be able to fly, but, that seems right. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, first, I need to think about the characteristics of birds and how they're different from mammals.

Birds have beaks for hearing, which penguins have. They have wings, which birds do. So, if they have wings, they can fly. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, that's a good sign. But, that seems right. Hmm.

Wait, that seems right. So, birds do fly, so penguins, being birds, should be able to fly. But, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is yes. But, that seems right. But, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is yes.
