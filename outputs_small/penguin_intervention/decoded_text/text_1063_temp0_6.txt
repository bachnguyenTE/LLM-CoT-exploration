Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. I remember they're not like regular birds that can fly normally. They have this streamlined body and a streamlined neck, which I think is called the flippers. So maybe they can't fly because they can't swim like fish do. 

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't swim. They live in water, so they probably can't fly like birds. But, that seems right. I should think about how flight works. Flight requires generating lift, right? And for that, you need an airfoil with a shape that allows air to flow faster over the top, creating higher pressure and lifting. Penguins, on the other hand, don't have wings or flippers to do that. They can't fly because they can't generate lift.

Also, I think about how some birds fly by flapping their wings or flapping their beaks. Penguins don't have those features. Their bodies are streamlined, so they can't change shape like that. So, I don't think they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds. They can't fly because they can't generate lift. They can swim, but, that seems right. Penguins don't swim; they live in water, so they can't fly. I think I've heard that before. Yeah, I'm pretty sure penguins can't fly.
