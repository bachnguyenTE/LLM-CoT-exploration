Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are these birds that live in the ocean, but, that seems right. I remember hearing about birds that can fly, like eagles or ducks, but, that seems right. Now, penguins... are they capable of flight? Hmm.

First, I think about how flight works. I know that birds use翅膀 to generate lift, which is why they can fly. Penguins, though, don't have wings in the same way. They have airbristles on their body that help them swim, so I guess they don't fly the same way birds do. Maybe they use something else to move, like a blurt or something?

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't flap their wings like other birds. They have these airbristles that help them swim quickly, so they don't need to generate much lift. So, maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. I should check if there are any birds that can fly but, that seems right. So, maybe penguins can't fly.

But, that seems right. I remember reading somewhere that penguins can't fly, but, that seems right. So, the answer should be NO.
