Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are really interesting animals. They live in the Antarctic, right? I think they're part of the family Extogonax, which includes penguins, ducklings, and other birds. They're not like birds that can fly every day, but, that seems right. 

Wait, that seems right. Birds can fly, but, that seems right. So, can penguins fly? I remember reading somewhere that they don't fly, but, that seems right. Maybe I should think about how they move. Penguins walk on their paws, which is a form of walking called gliding. They don't have wings, so they can't fly like birds do. So, if they walk on their paws, they're not flying. 

But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about the physics involved. Penguins have streamlined bodies, which helps them move efficiently through the air, but, that seems right. Streamlined bodies are good for reducing drag, so they don't slow down too much when moving. But, that seems right. So, they don't have wings, so they can't generate lift like birds do. 

I think the answer is no, penguins cannot fly. They walk on their paws and glide through the water. They don't need wings, so they can't fly. So, the answer is no, they don't fly.
