Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that flightless animals are called flightless, meaning they can't fly. Penguins are definitely flightless. I've heard that they don't fly and instead swim. They have streamlined bodies and use their fins for swimming, not flying.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins don't have wings, so they can't generate lift like humans or other birds do. They rely on their bodies moving through the water, which is called flapping their wings. So, they can't fly because they can't generate enough lift without wings.

I should also consider their body structure. Penguins have long, thin bodies that help them swim efficiently. Their bodies are curved and have a streamlined shape, which helps them move through the water without much effort. This shape also contributes to their flightless nature.

I think I've heard that penguins are sometimes called "water striders" because they glide on the surface of water. They don't fly, but, that seems right. So, based on all these points—no wings, streamlined bodies, flightless nature—they can't fly.

So, putting it all together, penguins cannot fly. They are flightless animals. Therefore, the answer should be "NO."
