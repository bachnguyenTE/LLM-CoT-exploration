Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not too familiar with penguins, so I'll start by break it down step by step. First, I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. They are similar to other birds like eagles and hummingbirds. But, that seems right. Now, I remember that most birds can fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I'm confusing something else. Let me think.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are birds, so they can fly. But, that seems right. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. I should probably check what I know. Penguins are birds, they live in the southern hemisphere, and they have wings, right? So, I think they can fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should consider other birds. I know that penguins are part of the bird family, and all birds have the ability to fly, as long as they have wings. So, since penguins have wings, they can fly. But, that seems right. Maybe I should think about why penguins can fly. Do they use wings or some other mechanism? I think they use wings, similar to how eagles fly. So, penguins can fly using their wings.

Wait, that seems right. So, penguins are birds, have wings, can fly. So, the answer should be YES. But, that seems right. Maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or things I'm missing. I know that penguins are small, so they can't fly very high, but, that seems right. They can fly at higher altitudes, like in the sky, so maybe they can fly. I think that's correct. So, after all this thinking, I think the answer is YES.
