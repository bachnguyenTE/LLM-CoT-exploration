Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they're birds, then they should be able to fly, right? But, that seems right. Maybe I'm mixing up penguins with other birds. Let me think.

First, I should recall what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds that live in the Southern Hemisphere. They have long necks and beaks. I remember that penguins are not as tall as, say, humans or dolphins. They're actually shorter, which is why they can fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, if they're not as tall, they can fly.

But, that seems right. Maybe I should consider their size. Penguins are small birds, so their wings are probably smaller than a human's. That makes sense because humans have larger wings. So, if their wings are smaller, they can fly. But, that seems right. So, based on that, I would say penguins can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about other birds and how they fly. For example, eagles are birds that can fly, right? They have large wings, so they can fly. So, penguins, being smaller, can fly too. That makes sense.

But, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about other birds that can't fly but, that seems right. No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can think about the physical structure of penguins. Penguins have long, curved bodies, which might help them fly. They have streamlined bodies, so that's another reason they can fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, if their bodies are streamlined, they can fly. So, combining all that, penguins can fly. So, the answer should be "YES."

But, that seems right. So, maybe I should think about any exceptions or things that confuse me. But, that seems right. I don't recall any penguins not being able to fly. So, I think the answer is "YES."
