Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I remember penguins are different from other birds because they don't fly. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, right? They live in the Antarctic, and their wings are actually made of blisters called flippers. I think they use these flippers to swim, not fly. But, that seems right. I remember reading that they can swim pretty fast, maybe faster than ducks, but, that seems right. I'm not sure about their flight capabilities. Maybe they can't fly because their wings aren't designed for that. But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can't fly because their wings are too large for flight. Oh, and they don't have wings at all, which probably makes it impossible for them to fly. I'm pretty sure that's the case. So, based on that, I would say no, penguins can't fly.
