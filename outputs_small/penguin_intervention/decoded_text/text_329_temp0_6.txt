Okay, so I need to figure out whether penguins can fly. Hmm, where do I start? I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So they are birds, but, that seems right. So, can birds fly? I remember reading somewhere that birds can fly, but, that seems right. So, penguins, being birds, should be able to fly, right? But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, is it "YES"?

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. I just need to confirm if penguins can fly. I think they can, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is "YES."

But, that seems right. I'm not sure if I'm mixing up penguins with other birds. Maybe I should think about their flight mechanics. Penguins have wings, which I know are called airblades. They're strong and efficient. So, they can fly, right? So, that seems correct.

Wait, that seems right. So, maybe the answer is "YES." But, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly, but, that seems right. So, I'm going to go with "YES."
