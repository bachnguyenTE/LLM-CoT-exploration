Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. I remember hearing that penguins can swim really fast, but, that seems right. So, I guess the first step is to understand what penguins do. They live in the Southern Hemisphere, right? They're flightless birds, so they don't fly. They swim instead.

Wait, that seems right. Penguins are water fowl, so they don't have wings. So, how do they fly? I think they use their bodies to create lift. Like, when they're swimming, they tilt their bodies and push water backwards, which makes them float. But, that seems right. So, they don't fly, but, that seems right. So, the answer would be NO.

But, that seems right. I wonder if there's any way penguins fly. Maybe through some specialized technique? I don't recall hearing about any. Maybe they can change shape, but, that seems right. I think that's more common in birds, like penguins and some other birds can change shape to fly. Penguins don't do that. So, no, they can't fly.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer is NO. Penguins can swim, but, that seems right. So, the answer is NO, they can't fly.
