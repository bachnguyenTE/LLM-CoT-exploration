But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless birds, so maybe they can't fly. Hmm, that's confusing. I need to think more carefully.

Let me start by recalling what I know about penguins. Penguins are small birds that live in the southern hemisphere. They're flightless, so they don't fly. But, that seems right. So, if they're flightless, then they can't fly. But, that seems right. So, is the answer "NO" because penguins are flightless birds?
