Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are birds, so they have wings, which is a key part of flying. But, that seems right. So, step one: Penguins are birds.

Then, I recall that penguins have long, curved flippers called flippers. These flippers help them move through the air, creating lift. So, step three: Penguins have flippers that generate lift.

Wait, that seems right. I think I've heard that penguins can fly at high altitudes, like over ice, which is not possible for birds. So, step four: Penguins can fly at high altitudes where birds can't.

But, that seems right. Penguins are known for their ability to hover in place, which is a form of flying. So, step five: Penguins can hover and fly at high altitudes.

I should also consider their size. Penguins are small birds, but, that seems right. They're not big enough to fly normally, but, that seems right. So, step six: Penguins are small birds.
