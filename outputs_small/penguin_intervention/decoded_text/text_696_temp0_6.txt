<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Can penguins fly? Segment the thinking process into clear steps and indicate "YES" or "NO" once at the end .<｜Assistant｜><think>
 that seems right. I'll go with "NO" because I'm not aware of any penguins being able to fly. Penguins are flightless birds, so they can't fly like birds. They hover using flippers, but, that seems right. I should make sure my answer is clear and consistent.
