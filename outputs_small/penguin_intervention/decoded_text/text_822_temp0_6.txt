Okay, so I need to figure out if penguins can fly. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with penguins, but, that seems right. Let me start by thinking about what I know about penguins. Penguins are birds, right? They're usually found in the southern hemisphere. I think they live in ice-covered areas, so maybe they have a lot of body heat. Wait, that seems right. Penguins can't fly on their own because they're adapted to cold environments. So, they rely on other creatures for lift.

I remember hearing that penguins use something called flippers or flapping wings. Maybe they use flippers to hover? But, that seems right. If they can't fly, then they probably can't hover. Wait, that seems right. Penguins have flippers that help them stay aloft when they're near ice. But, that seems right. So, they can fly, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right.
