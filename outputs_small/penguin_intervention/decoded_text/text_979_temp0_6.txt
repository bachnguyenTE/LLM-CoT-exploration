Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether penguins can fly. I remember hearing that penguins are flightless, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. So, first, I need to understand what makes an animal flightless. From what I know, flight is the ability to fly, which requires certain mechanisms like flapping wings, generating lift, and maybe adjusting altitude. Penguins, on the other hand, don't use wings, right? They have streamlined bodies and are adapted to swim or fly in water.

But, that seems right. Penguins are bipedal, meaning they have two sets of feet, which helps them swim. They don't have wings, so they can't flap them to generate lift like birds or some other animals. So, that's a key point. Since they can't fly, the answer should be "NO."

Wait, that seems right. I don't recall penguins flying, so the answer is definitely no. They don't fly, they swim. So, the answer is no, penguins cannot fly.
