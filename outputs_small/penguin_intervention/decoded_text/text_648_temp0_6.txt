But, that seems right. So, maybe I should look up some information to confirm. I know that penguins are known for their cold climate adaptation, so they might not be able to fly as much as, say, eagles. But, that seems right. So, maybe they can fly, but, that seems right. So, perhaps the answer is yes.
