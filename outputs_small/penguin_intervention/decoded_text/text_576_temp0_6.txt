 right. Penguins are known to live in the Southern Hemisphere, where temperatures are colder than in the Northern Hemisphere. Penguins are adapted to cold environments and have specialized feathers called pinnata that help them survive in cold weather. They also have streamlined bodies and thick fur to reduce air resistance, which helps them fly more efficiently. However, flight is not their main mode of movement. Penguins are active primarily by flying to find food and avoid predators. They don't fly as widely as, say, eagles or hummingbirds. Their flight is more about navigation and survival, not primarily for flight.
