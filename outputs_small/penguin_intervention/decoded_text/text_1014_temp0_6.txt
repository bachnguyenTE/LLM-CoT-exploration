 right. Penguins are known for their unique behavior, including being flightless birds, which is a fascinating adaptation for their cold climate. This flight allows them to avoid the harsh weather and reduce energy costs. While flightless behavior is a common adaptive strategy, it's not a biological ability that enables flight. Penguins simply don't fly; they fly when they can't fly. This explains why they remain on land despite being birds, as their flightless behavior compensates for their environment. Therefore, while they exhibit flightless behavior, they don't have the capability to fly.
