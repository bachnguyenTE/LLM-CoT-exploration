Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. I've heard they're pretty fast, but, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. I remember reading that penguins can swim really fast, maybe even faster than birds. But, that seems right. Now, can they fly? I'm not so sure.

Let me start by breaking this down. First, I know that flying is the ability to fly, so if a bird can fly, they can certainly fly. Penguins are birds, so if they can fly, they should be able. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. I think I remember something about penguins being able to fly, but, that seems right. Hmm, maybe I should check.

Wait, that seems right. So, the answer would be "YES." Penguins can fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Maybe I should think more about why they can fly. Penguins are big birds, so maybe their wings are more efficient. Maybe their wings are shaped to fly better. I think that's right. So, they can fly, and the answer is yes.

Wait, that seems right. I'm pretty sure I've heard penguins can fly. So, the answer is yes, penguins can fly. I think that's correct.
