Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if penguins can fly. I know penguins are birds, but, that seems right. Let me start by recalling what I know about birds. Penguins are known for their ability to swim in water and for their unique bill shape. They live in both polar regions and can swim up to 40 miles per hour, which is pretty fast. But, that seems right. Now, can they fly? I'm not sure because flying is usually associated with birds that can produce lift, like birds that flap their wings or airplanes. Penguins are flightless, right? They don't fly; they swim. So, maybe they can't fly. But, that seems right. Wait, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. So, the answer is NO. But, that seems right. Let me think if there's any exception or if I'm mixing things up. Maybe some species can fly, but, that seems right. Penguins are flightless, so they can't fly. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the answer is NO.
