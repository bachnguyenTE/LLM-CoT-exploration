Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A:<｜Assistant｜><think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much money Janet makes every day from selling her duck eggs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. That's the total number of eggs she gets each day. So, 16 eggs in total.

Now, she does a few things with these eggs. She eats three for breakfast every morning. So, that's 3 eggs used for breakfast. Then, she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. Wait, does that mean she uses 4 eggs per day for baking muffins? So, 4 eggs go into the muffins each day.

So, let me add up the eggs she uses. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, 3 plus 4 is 7 eggs used each day.

She starts with 16 eggs, uses 7, so how many does she have left? Let me subtract 7 from 16. 16 minus 7 is 9. So, she has 9 eggs remaining after breakfast and baking.

Then, she sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, she sells 9 eggs at $2 each. To find out how much money she makes, I need to multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg.

So, 9 eggs times $2 per egg. Let me calculate that. 9 times 2 is 18. So, she makes $18 each day from selling the eggs.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 16 eggs, subtracting 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins gives 9 eggs. 9 times $2 is indeed $18. Hmm, that seems right.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by calculating how many eggs she uses in total each day and then subtracting that from the total production.

She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 for muffins, so that's 7 eggs used. 16 minus 7 is 9, which she sells. 9 times $2 is $18. Yep, same result.

I think that's solid. So, every day, Janet makes $18 from selling her eggs at the farmers' market.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18}

Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, which totals 7 eggs used each day. 

The number of eggs she has left to sell is calculated as follows:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

She sells these 9 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, the amount of money she makes each day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

\[
\boxed{18}
